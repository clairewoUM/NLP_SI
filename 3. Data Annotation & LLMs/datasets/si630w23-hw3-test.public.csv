"""Tons of people"" is a meaningless phrase unless we interpret it literally, in which case it means ""at least 23"".","Ok, so this phrase comes up a lot, and it's actually a pretty big [weasel word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word). News reports will say ""some scientists say..."", and the question is always, well, how many of them say it? 

""A ton of people...""

Is it most of them? Probably not, otherwise the report would say so. Is it a lot of them? Probably not, again, otherwise the report would be about some large representative body making a statement. The only assumption left is that it is a small amount that is not either a majority, or an influential portion, but at that point, the diversity of human opinion on most topics means that the report itself is almost meaningless, since ""some people believe"" can be followed up with nearly any statement. Merely qualifying those people as scientists barely makes it newsworthy.

In a similar, but less formal vein, the weasel phrase ""tons of people"" comes up a lot. What is tons of people? It's informal, so it's rare to see the phrase interrogated as to specific meaning, and it's not as important to determine if its true or false. However, in a similar fashion to the way that the phrase [""a couple of"" can mean ""exactly or at least two""](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/couple#Usage_notes), I'd like the phrase tons of people to mean ""at least 23"". 

This is because the average weight of an adult human male is 194.7 pounds.

The average weight of an adult human female is 164.7, giving us an average weight of a person at 179.7.

Taking the pluralized form of ""tons"" to mean ""a minimum of two tons"", it would take at least twenty-three people on average to cumulatively weigh over 4000 pounds. This is the only literal interpretation of the phrase ""tons of people"" or else, it is merely an emphatic plural that is as vague in meaning as only saying ""more than one person"". 

You've got tons of people who like your idea? Name twenty-three of them. If they can't break an elevator, you don't have tons of people.",tzbb7y,"In Britain, a ton is colloquially used to refer to 100 of something.",i3xz4vd
All political stances ultimately divide into being supported by verifiable fact or virtuous principle.,"There is no in-between; many debated topics are divide in this manor and although individual arguments may be mixed among the two standpoints, there is always one argument that is mostly based on circumstantial evidence and one argument based of hopeful optimism.

 Climate-change and the people arguing for a social correction are supported by verifiable fact, the people opposing restrictions and new practices argue that the evidence is suspect or the sample isn't relative meaning that we haven't sampled enough to disrupt the economy, an virtuous principle that some do not believe in. Abortion is verifiably an end of life, and the verifiable fact that zygotes don't have the same rights as a citizen is the basis for pro-choice parties while the virtuous principle that human-life is universally equal and should be made equal by legislation is the basis for pro-life parties. People in support of Sex-work legalization and regulation cite the verifiable fact that sex acts have been exchanged for money for centuries and it continues to this day regardless of legality, people opposed to Sex-work legalization and acceptance believe that sex acts are extremely meaningful and should only be performed between loving partners, a virtuous principle that not all adhere to. Communism has not been proven successful in practice, it is a verifiable fact that most Communist states do not sustainability support and defend their citizens, people arguing that successful Communism is attainable base their beliefs on the virtuous principle that people will treat each other fairly at all times if educated properly. 

Tell me if there are other reasons to choose a side in debate; is there more to reason than logic and virtue, besides amoral opportunism*?

**I include amoral opportunism as a reason for decision making but do not include it in the forming of a political stance; doing whatever will advance you to a position that you strive for is independent from a political stance.",o7cpvm,"It's very limiting to exclude morals, because different groups have different moral frameworks. And as they are social constructs, none are technically correct. Political stances are the synthesis of moral stances and perceived facts. Even when all the facts in a situation are known, political stances are swayed by morals -- not just their own, but the morals of their community. People bend facts to suit their morals alarmingly often, which adds to the illusion that it's all a big misunderstanding -- and yet knowing the full story still won't sway most people. They'll move the goal posts back, then move them forward next chance they get.

Some people think homeless folk deserve a house, since there's more than enough for all of them. They believe it's immoral to not do so, because it would be easy and only a mild inconvenience to a few very wealthy individuals. Others believe they've earned their suffering until they can find and hold a job, and it would be immoral to steal homes from a bank that owns 50,000 of them.  
Most people thought John Brown was awful for killing slavers while he was alive. Some people venerated him, ignoring the slavers' legal rights. The list goes on. As much as we all (me included) naturally think in black and white, morals are neither good nor bad nor based on facts. They're just the sentiment of the majority. And you can't act on a fact, no matter how small, without having some moral or sentiment driving you.",h34r5lw
I should stop hiring from college that do not use SAT scores,"The trendy new thing seems to be to remove merit as a qualification because it is racist. I'm not here to debate that.

For reference

As an employer, I want to hire the best within my budget. I know college does not teach anything directly relevant to what the job I'm hiring for does, and I know most learning will be on the job. I believe that good test scores are a proxy for a candidate's ability to learn on the job. I believe good test scores show that a candidate is willing to devote time and effort into a goal.

If a college is choosing to not use merit for acceptance, I don't see why it is a good idea to hire anyone from that school. I don't see a reason to even look at candidate resumes from that school. In fact, I see a reason to actively disqualify candidates who went to that school. A high GPA from the school does not strike me as meaningful when the school is not merit based.

I see this as a school that just wishes to enroll more students and receive more tuition than a school which cares about educating it students.",nek1vc,"""If a college is choosing to not use merit for acceptance"" is not the same as ""college that do not use SAT score"". Likewise, ""school X doesn't use the SAT in admissions"" is not the same as ""school X is not merit based."" Those are unrelated statements.

Facebook Should Not Have Been Fined 5 Billion Dollars," So Facebook was fined by the FTC 5 billion dollars. And everyone's like, ""Oh, it's just a slap on the wrist."" Meanwhile I am completely at a loss for what they did wrong.  


I know what Cambridge Analytica did wrong. But I don't see what Facebook did wrong. The way I see it Facebook is no more responsible for Cambridge Analytica than how Apple or Google is responsible for apps in their app stores. Plus they give you this 'are you sure you want to share your data with XYZ' screen. I fail to see how Cambridge Analytica is Facebook's fault.  


The worst thing that I could find is that Facebook had an API that allowed you to see what your friends liked.

the little mermaid played by a black person is racist and manipulative.,"Full disclaimer, I am white. White as sour cream. However I dont think that should discount from my reasoning. In this time of growing acceptance for people of all minorities groups, I dont see a reason to mess with already flushed out characters.

This racial ""sub-in"" is clearly just a half ass attempt to appeal to a minority group, it's the same shit, with a different skin (no pun intended). 

Why not give a black mermaid her own story? Why not expand on the world, create a new modern experience? Simple, because social justice sells, and its much easier to sell the same stuff with a inclusive twist than to create a new narrative.

I have no issue with a black mermaid, I have an issue with the same stuff being repackaged and sold to us as ""new"".

Its lazy, its minipulative and its insulting.

Most religious people in developed countries are simply not interested (or perhaps not interested enough) in the truth.,"I became an atheist when I was around 13 after previously believing in God but not actively participating in any religion. My family comprises of a mixture of religious people and atheists so I realise I come from a privileged position in that I was not disowned or shunned by my family for being atheist but rather was met with indifference. 

And I also acknowledge that many religious people are secret atheists and just aren't ""out"" yet but I dont class these people as religious. In the term ""religous"" I encompass anyone who believes (and truly belives) in a religious deity. In fact, I could probably encompass all spiritual people in my point. Basically, those who believe in spirituality and/or a deity are not interested or not interested enough (in the sense they care more about something else) in the truth. 

There are a many arguments for the existence of God, such as the ontological argument, the blind watch maker, personal experiences/emotions etc. But there are only a finite number. Every single argument for the existence of God has been debunked time and time again so while some of these arguments sound convincing, upon further research or further thought you realise they aren't. 

And for most people who believe in a deity, their belief system is philosophically inconsistent. They use one philosophy in terms of how to determine truth in the case of God but use a different one in other scenarios. It's the definition of doublethink. 

This leads me to ask, why do so many people in the modern age and in developed countries still believe in God? And the answer is as stated in the title. They aren't that bothered about the truth. 

If they cared about the truth, they would research atheism and understand the arguments for an against it. They would realise the inconsistencies in their own philosophy and either get rid of the notion of absolute truth or get rid of God.

Even in a debate, you see that Christian's most of the time only care about feeling that they have won rather than converting the other party. When it becomes apparent that every one of their arguments are flawed, they resort to defensive strategies that are equally illogical. Either that or they simply dont listen to the other side and just restate their arguments again and again. These people are by no means stupid, so why do they behave like this in a debate? Because they aren't interested in the truth. They just want to continue believing what they do and feel like they've won the debate even if they clearly haven't. 

And most religious people are the same. They just want to continue to believe what they believe because it's better than the alternative. In some cases the alternative is accepting that human beings are not that important in the universe, in some cases the alternative is being shunned by their family, being extradited from their culture and losing their identity. I realise all these cases aren't the same but they're all examples of where a theist cares more about something else than they do about the truth. In a sense, they do not care enough about the truth. 

I think there are a few main ways that you could change my mind: 
1) Come up with another reason someone might remain a theist that is more widespread than the reasoning above. 
2) Convince me that there are some arguments for the existence of God that haven't yet been debunked convincingly or that the debunking of one of the arguments itself isn't convincing. 
3) Explain how believing in God can be philosophically consistent and how it is philosophically consistent for the majority of theists. 


I would actually like my view to be changed because I dont enjoy being cynical about religious people. I would like to gain a fuller understanding of why people believe what they do (whatever that may be).",ehli2s,"I think you make the mistake of it being either/or.  There is a third option of being agnostic, that is, believing it is not possible, (at least in this life) to know if God exists or not.
There's no hard evidence that God exists, and equally there's no evidence he doesn't.  So it's inaccurate to say they ignore the truth.  The fact is we don't know what is the truth.  
We have no idea if time existed before the big bang.  Did God bring about the big bang?  Why are the fundamental forces in nature just right for the universe to exist?  How did life start?  There are so many unanswered questions we can't rule out the existence of a God.",fclnzk8
No one should be on death row and the death penalty is immoral.,"I think the death penalty is immoral because you are killing someone when you don’t have to, I consider it just as immoral as normal murder.

The arguments I hear for the death penalty seem to present it as some people obviously should die which I don’t get or that people should get punished for there actions. I don’t think the government should be looking to actively punish anyone. Prison should be there to deter people and rehabilitation not for punishment.

Also I’m catholic and don’t understand how other Christians can possibly support the death penalty as it seem to go against most of Jesus’s teachings.

Edit: prison should also be there to protect people.",kcdcb3,"I agree that murder is murder irrespective of it being sanctioned by the state or a street gang, and I also agree that our justice system should focus primarily on rehabilitation and reform with no provision for revenge made whatsoever.  In that criminals rarely expect to get caught it is doubtful that the possibility of a death penalty serves as much of a deterrent.  That having been said I do believe that the death penalty does have a place in our justice system.  There are a handful of sociopathic, sadistic, narcissistic, broken, and or mentally unstable individuals who cannot or will not be reformed.  Imprisoning such individuals indefinitely is not only a costly endeavor but, serves to create a less humane environment for those who can be reformed with time served.  In such cases the death penalty should not only be sought but, should be expedited.",gfq61o8

Nationalism is an irrational and dangerous ideology.,"As a preface, I'd like to specify that there is nothing wrong with being proud one's country if they do something particularly well. For instance, someone living in any Western European democracy may proud of their Human Rights advances, and that is just fine.
The problem arises when people choose to identify blindly with their own nation simply because it is the country in which they live. This leads to an ""othering"" of people from separate nations, when they may be just like me. I am from the US, but a person from China, England, or anywhere in between is foremost a human regardless of where they live. Why should location be any determining factor of the quality of someone's character or values? 
This arbitrary grouping of people by country contributes to problems such as racism and classicism, such as the Southern US's antipathy towards Mexico and Mexicans.

"if we are going to treat college like a public good (similar to K-12), then Pete Buttegiege's plan makes no sense.","Basically, it seems like the Democrats are leaning heavily into this idea of free college. Obviously, this doesn't mean free as in absolutely no cost. It just means that tax dollars will pay for it and there is no upfront costs that a student has to pay aside from maybe some application fees. 

I agree with this as it is how public universities used to be  (more or less) and a more educated populous is better for everyone in society as it can grow the economy among other benefits. 

Pete has come around to say that he supports it but only for ""non-rich"" families. It was either $150,000 or $200,000 but if a family made more than that, they were ineligible for the benefit. I understand where Pete is coming from. Telling a truck driver in Iowa to pay for the kid of a family make 4x what they are earning seems unfair. Also, education is still the best way to lift someone out of poverty so helping those who are already ""winning"" makes no sense.  It is also saying that ""if you can pay for it, you should pay out of pocket"". 

My problem is that is not how public goods work. We don't say ""if you make under $100,000/yr, you can drive on public roads but over that, you have to take the toll road"" or say that libraries are only accessible to people who can't afford to buy books.


It seems to me that if we are going to agree that public university is going to be a public good, it needs to be accessible to everyone regardless of their personal wealth. Otherwise, just call it ""Pell Grant 2.0"" or something.",egv5oq,"Except we do that in public domain all the time, from progressive taxes to social welfare to waved fees.

"The Last Jedi was both a great movie, and a great Star Wars movie.","I guess this is a little less serious than some of the posts here, but I seriously want some thoughts on this. I see a lot of criticism of TLJ, everything from ""I just didn't really like it"" to ""this is treason to every Star Wars fan,"" and I just don't get the stuff to the latter end of the spectrum. To be more specific, the two criticisms I see a lot are that A) Luke was a deadbeat, and that left a lot of people upset that this former hero was less heroic, and B) in that vein, they're moving away from what made Star Wars, Star Wars -- the movie was too ""goofy/Disneyfied."" 

There are various things that weren't perfect, in my opinion -- the Leia scene was a little odd, and the Finn/Rose plotline felt a little emotionally un-earned -- but I think those, a long with maaany of the criticisms I see, are really just personal opinion/minor issues, not deepseated flaws with the narrative or the film as a whole.

To A): Luke was supposed to be a deadbeat! That was the whole point! He removed himself from the Jedi Order because he thought it deserved to die out, and made himself into a hermit. Rey was able to convince him that there was value in the old ways, and in the process he sacrifices himself in a deeply heroic way.

To B): Star Wars has always been goofy! R2 and C-3PO are essentially Abbot and Costello, Luke's a huge dork, Chewbacca is essentially a slapstick character half the time he's on screen.

Insidious is 'scarier' than The Conjuring,"While they are essentially the same story I think there are better executions in Insidious than in The Conjuring. Examples being the 'music' really made me feel uneasy. The jump scares were frightening in the sense that it was subtle, a ghost would casually walk across the room from a dark corner out of nowhere instead of jumping at the screen. Even though they were quite funny and ridiculous at times, other times they were quite ominous. That alone made them unsolvable. Their presence can be funny, silly and terrifying.
The face expressions of sheer terror of the cast and acting in general was more convincing and added to the terror. There was a lot the movie did right and I hope to see another one like it.

While in The Conjuring, the jump scares are mostly objects moving/breaking, unexplained behavior and moments that could have been scary but ended up being ridiculous as it dragged on with poor executions (the ghosts). Parts of the story that took you away from the intensity. It wasn't all bad though.

Saying vitamin supplements are unnecessary because we can get our vitamins from food is misguided and short sighted,"TLDR: Vitamin supplements are not useless especially for people who cannot eat a balanced diet. 

I often browse through reddit, when I'm not browsing through www.nhs.uk, when I look for medical opinions and advice. I've observed how so many people declare that vitamin supplements are useless, unneeded, or ""unnecessarily expensive urine"" because, as you would have guessed from the title, they claim that, ""vitamin supplements are useless because we can get our vitamins from food"".

What about the people who can't afford to cook healthy meals or eat healthy meals on a daily basis?

Bananas with spots &gt; Perfectly yellow bananas,"Bananas with spots &gt; bananas without spots

Here's my reasoning: Bananas with spots always taste sweeter than perfectly yellow bananas. I'm sure there's some chemistry behind this, but perfectly yellow bananas have never tasted as sweet as ones with brown spots imo.

Bananas with spots are softer than perfectly yellow bananas. This makes it easier to blend finely in smoothies and more pleasant to eat in general. Yes, they may bruise easier, but if you keep them on racks then you shouldn't have a propbelm anyways.

Bananas with spots are easier to peel. As they ripen past pure yellow, the peel begins to soften too. I find that bananas with spots are often easier to peel without bruising compared to yellow bananas.

I look forward to hearing your alternative views. Please CMV!

Youtube needs to start forcing overly child friendly content creators to join YouTubeKids.,"Take a look at the trending page on YouTube. You might notice that the majority of the creators base their content, thumbnail, and titles of their videos around YOUNG children. YouTube was never intended for kids below the age of 13. I’m telling you right now, no 13 year old kid has unironically watched a roblox video. Those billions of views it got this year? Guess how old those viewers were. 

 These channels clutter up YouTube when they should be in YouTube Kids.  Forcing them to move to YouTube kids would allow other channels to make the trending page of YouTube. 
I’m tired and tired of seeing the same people get trending page when all they do is create cringe content that only kids who practically just popped out of the womb would enjoy. I was hoping that the recent events with the FTC or COPPA would drive these channels to move to YtKids, but it seems that will not be the case. 

I’m not going to list their YT channel names because I don’t believe they deserve any advertisement. 

Time and time again Youtube fails to make the website a better place. For example:
-Why not ban Elsa gate channels?
-Why not ban channels who scam kids?
-Why not FORCE content creators to swap to YTKids when their content is literally FOR KIDS?

They’d rather demonetize the creators that actually deserve to be on the platform than do ANYTHING that’d benefit the platform.

It’s clear YouTube has never really cared about the quality of their platform. They just want money. This years rewind for example. It looks like they just asked a 5th grader who has never used a computer in their life to make it.",ec5lt7,That's half of YouTube nowadays,fb9ov2z
Parents should not give their children iPhones until they are in high school.,"I see no need for kids to have phones before high school, and even then, I don't really think it's even necessary. **I understand that they may need to reach parents or call for a ride home, but there are alternatives to iPhones that are much cheaper (e.g.flip phones).** Look, I'm a high school student myself who spent many years being angry at my parents because I didn't have a phone until 9th grade. I felt left out at times because my friends had all these cool games to play and were obsessing over what to post on Instagram or Musical.ly. I even made a paper iPhone with its own decorated lock screen because I just wanted to have an iPhone of my own. I was so excited about even the most insignificant parts of iPhones, and planned out my phone password months in advance. All in all, I really hyped phones up for nothing, and now I can thank my parents for NOT giving me a phone until when they did.

Yes, it's important to stay in touch with people, and not feel left out, especially during pandemic times. I'm all for that. But in middle school, I was still playing outside with other kids and not caught up in silly drama on social media. I started learning how to study and didn't get distracted by a phone, like some of my friends did who got their phones towards the elementary school. I had a childhood that didn't revolve around posting every single highlight to my Instagram story. Arguably, I was happier at times. Don't even get me started on eight year olds with phones...

You might say that a kid should learn how to spend their time wisely from a young age, and that includes how much time they should spend on their phones. Well, I've met very few eleven year olds that would have self control with their new devices... Instead of having them be distracted from the very beginning of middle school, how about letting them pick up good study habits first. Lastly, I find that when I spend too much time on my phone, I 1) lose time to do other things 2) don't usually end up happier.

So, Reddit...Change my view! I'll admit that there's probably things I haven't considered, so I'd like to hear your thoughts. Thank you!",ndchvk,"well parents should teache better how to use an iphone

People's obsession with having to use socks of the same pair is irrational and unjustified,"Socks generally serve the purpose of warming your feet and providing insulation between your feet and floors/shoes. For the most part, your socks will be covered by shoes when you are in public, thus making their fashionability a non-factor. Taking the time to organize your sock drawer so that matching socks are next to each other takes time and effort which could be used in more efficient ways (such as watching paint dry or grass grow). Simply bringing these points up to rational people will result in being a laughing stock for even suggesting that a black and a white sock can be worn at the same time on different feet. I have heard people literally opt to not use socks over using socks of different pairs. This type of toxic closed-minded thinking has to stop.

I will concede that some socks don't make sense to wear together, such as one tennis sock and one wool sock. And to my understanding, many religious communities prohibit the use of shoes in their places of worship. Thus it is understandable that a greater emphasis is put on sock fashionability in these communities.

In conclusion, I believe that people's belief that only socks of the same pair should be worn together is irrational.

The no questions asked is a bit of an exaggeration sorry. I actually mean that they shouldn't be a hundred barriers before getting what they need/want. There only should be a dialogue with a doctor that has been following them so they can assess how serious this demand is.


Pay attention here! I am NOT saying that all people with a difficult to treat incurable illness SHOULD BE sterilized, that's messed up. There are three criteria here: 



• Incurable illness



• Difficult to treat



• THEY WANT TO GET STERILIZED 



On the opposite: people that fit the first two criteria that want to have children should have access to specialized help and support to they can exercise their right to extend their family/lineage in a safe, enriching way.




Now that this potential misunderstanding has been made clear, let me tell you my arguments. Some people in that situation would be in great danger if they became pregnant. Some believe getting an abortion would be wrong if they got pregnant soy they would be putting themselved through a risk for a baby they do not want. Some of them do not have access to safe abortions in case they become pregnant. For some, getting an abortion would be a danger to their health/life. Some have suffered a great deal because of their illness and wouldn't want to pass it on to their children. Some have a massive financial burden because of their illness and don't want to risk the extra $ burden of a child or an abortion (if in the US, I live in Canada so that shit is free). Some of them could not give the proper care a child needs because they're incapacitated by their illness. Off the top of my head those are the main reasons.



I come from a personal place, I am bipolar type 1 and borderline. Bipolar disorder is treatable but incurable, it can be passed to a child, pregnancy would ask me to stop my medication which took YEARS to put in place, childbirth puts people at risk for PPD. BPD is very difficult to treat and some scientists think it may be incurable in some people (read in class that 25% of borderline people still fit the criteria after like 15 years of therapy). I need a perfect routine every single day so I can function and because my BD1 is stable after years of struggle thanks to the medication (which I tend to forget if things change in my life) I wouldn't want to risk fucking that up. In my own case, BPD would make me fuck up a child emotionally, and even if I was stable then, I don't want the emotional stress of a child making me relapse. Finally, many people say that the only symptom that tends to linger in people that no longer fit the criteria for BPD is the ongoing feeling of emptiness, I'll let you guess what that implies.



But since I my illnesses are mental disorders they would never sterilize me because I am not mentally fit to make that desicion. Bitch, that's the point. I'm not mentally fit to decide what to do with my body but if I wanted to have a child tomorrow that's a desicion I'm allowed and would be fit to make? I'm guessing my doctor wouldn't encourage it, but I still have the last call for something that impacts the rest of my life, why don't I (and many people with even more terrible illnesses) have it about getting sterilized.

Nuclear weapons and Mutual Assured Destruction have had a net negative effect on international relations because they enable hostile countries to commit numerous little acts such as cyberattacks and then hide behind those nuclear weapons as a shield against retaliation.,"I'm talking about acts that, in themselves, are not particularly war-worthy in this day and age. Back before 1949, if you kept pissing off another country, you risked war. You couldn't keep ""poking the bear"" and not suffer retaliation. Carthage in particular learned that lesson the hard way in 146 BC. Britain kept bothering the fledgling United States in the early 19th century, culminating in the War of 1812.

Now, countries such as Russia, China, and North Korea can engage in countless acts such as the Solarwinds breach or the invasion of Ukraine without fear of consequences. They're basically saying ""What are you going to do about it, America/France/Britain? Hack us back? We'll nuke you."" You can say the same thing with this shitshow in the South China Sea. It's accepted by every country in the world, except China, that China's claims on that body are invalid. Nevertheless, PLAN ships repeatedly sail into other countries' waters, their crews knowing full well that no one wants to risk war in order to stop them.",m2zr6x,"Everything you described has almost nothing to do with nuclear weapons. The reason the United States isn’t attacking Russia for what happened in Ukraine or China for their islands because at this point the costs of war just aren’t worth the benefits. A successful invasion and occupation of those countries would be a massive undertaking and wouldn’t really give us the benefit we would want from a large scale war. 

The cyber attacks, while important, don’t rise to the issue of starting an international conflict and not because of nuclear weapons. If Cuba was committing the cyber attacks that Russia was, we wouldn’t invade Cuba either, because it wouldn’t be worth it. 

In addition, even if this did have something to do with nuclear weapons, wouldn’t it be a net positive that they are preventing full scale war?",gqnn1pa
If you are not happy with yourself then you will struggle to be happy in a relationship,"What I mean by ""happy with yourself"" is that you do not need validation from others, feel like you are good enough, accept yourself, enjoy your own company and feel complete by yourself/not relying on someone else to make you happy.

If you struggle with something like this, it is very easy for it to take a toll on any relationship sooner or later. For example, if you lack confidence and are not comfortable in your own skin, adding a partner to the equation won't reduce or stop those fears and insecurities because they keep lingering at the back of your mind. Sure, a healthy loving relationship would make you feel happier and you may forget about your problems for that moment if you are with the right person, but feelings of low self-esteem and insecurities bottle up whether you are in a relationship or not. 

It is very easy for someone with those feelings to rely on their partner for things like their self-worth. This puts an immense amount of pressure on your partner and it is mentally exhausting because no one is responsible for your happiness. Codependency is straining on a relationship. Additionally, these kinds of feelings make it difficult to create a balance between two people since there would not be an equal level of support for each other on both sides. 

I guess the point I am trying to make is that one should not go into a relationship thinking it would solve all problems and lead to some sort of fulfilment in life. Issues with self-esteem cannot be ""fixed"" by anyone and you certainly shouldn't rely on someone else to do that. You are a whole and complete human on your own, without anyone else.",t8z5l6,"Two issues I can see with this. First, the criteria you give for being happy with oneself are highly restrictive. I don't know anyone like that. For example, the vast majority of people require validation from others. We are a social species. We needed it from parents and peers as a child, and need it from friends and family as adults. This is very human. If these criteria hold, then there should be very few successful relationships, which is not the case.

Also, relationships require work. People who insist that they just need to find the lock to fit their key are sorely disappointed. We all come with baggage. Part of having a successful relationship is doing the work to both accommodate the baggage of our chosen, but imperfectly adjusted  partner, and to effectively communicate our own needs to this idiosyncratic individual, so they can deal with our baggage. A popular theory of this is that our personalities are shaped by relational deficits in childhood, as a result of parental imperfection (no parent is perfect, nor should they be). We have emotional needs and challenges based on these early experiences. We then seek out partners who recreate in a milder form the relational deficits of our childhoods, and attempt to resolve them in our adult primary relationships. Successful partnerships are then pairings where both parties have successfully negotiated this resolution with their partner, not situations where both have somehow escaped relational trauma, because such trauma (used broadly) is inescapable. Childhood is hard.",hzrmtrx
Telekinesis is the ultimate superpower.,"I'm sorry, but people have yet to convince me there is a superpower better than telekinesis.

Here are just a few things you could do with that unlimited power:

You could alter light waves to make thing appear different.
You could fly.
You could change the density of objects.
You could add or remove protons, neutrons, or electrons, effectively turning certain materials into others.
Based on the point above, you could have an infinite amount of anything you want.
You could alter neurotransmitters and neural signals in people's brains, making them think, see, hear, feel, or do anything you want.
Alter sound waves so only specific people hear specific things.

Starting the game with infinite gold, infinite lives, and crazy powers is fun, but only for about 20 minutes.

If you define ""ultimate"" as most useful for ordinary people, I'd think most people would benefit much more from a quality of life superpower, or a superpower that helps them overcome something they're struggling with.

The Talibans take over of Afghanistan should have received the same amount of media recognition as the Russian takeover of Ukraine.,"Whilst the current events are still ongoing in Ukraine, I feel that the media has forgotten about Afghanistan. By media I also mean social media, where people have changed their profile pictures in solidarity with Ukraine but never did any sort of thing when Afghanistan was taken over. I believe this is because Ukraine is a White European country which has been invaded by a historically “bad person” country. I am not here to defend Russia, I am questioning the double standard that has formed where a Middle Eastern country can be violently taken over with reports of kidnappings, executions and threats and social media doesn’t bat an eye but when a white European country be taken over all of the sudden the media does care and pays serious attention towards the events.",u5l0g0,Probly already brought up but the biggest difference in the nuclear threat.

Statistics is much more valuable than Trigonometry and should be the focus in schools,"I've been out of school for quite a while, so perhaps some things have changed. My understanding is that most high school curriculums cover algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and for advanced students, pre-calculus or calculus. I'm not aware of a national standard that requires statistics.

For most people, algebra - geometry - trigonometry are rarely if ever used after they leave school. I believe that most students don't even see how they might use these skills, and often mock their value.

Basic statistics can be used almost immediately and would help most students understand their world far better than the A-G-T skills. Simply knowing concepts like Standard Deviation can help most people intuitively understand the odds that something will happen. Just the rule of thumb that the range defined by average minus one standard deviation to the average plus one standard deviation tends to cover 2/3's of the occurrences for normally distributed sets is far more valuable than memorizing SOH-CAH-TOA.

I want to know if there are good reasons for the A-G-T method that make it superior to a focus on basic statistics. Help me change my view.

Edit:

First off, thank everyone for bringing up lots of great points. It seems that the primary thinking is falling into three categories:

A. This is a good path for STEM majors - I agree, though I don't think a STEM path is the most common for most students. I'm not saying that the A-G-T path should be eliminated, but that the default should replace stats for trig.

B. You cannot learn statistics before you learn advanced math. I'm not sure I understand this one well enough as I didn't see a lot of examples that support this assertion.

C. Education isn't about teaching useful skills, but about teaching students how to think. - I don't disagree, but I also don't think I understand how trig fulfills that goal better than stats.

This isn't a complete list, but it does seem to contain the most common points. I'm still trying to get through all of the comments (as of now 343 in two hours), so if your main point isn't included, please be patient, I'm drinking from a fire hose on this one ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Edit #2 with Analysis and Deltas:

First off, thank everyone for your great responses and thoughtful comments!

I read every topline comment - though by the time I got to the end there were 12 more, so I'm sure by the time I write this there will still be some I didn't get to read. The responses tended to fall into six general categories. There were comments that didn't fall into these, but I didn't find them compelling enough to create a category. Here is what I found:

**STEM / Trades / Engineering (39%)**

16% said that you need A-G-T to prepare you for STEM in college - This was point A above and I still don't think this is the most common use case

14% said that tradespeople use Trig all the time - I understand the assertion, but I'm not sure I saw enough evidence that says that all students should take Trig for this reason alone

10% included the saying ""I'm an engineer"" - As an engineer and someone that works with lots of engineers I just found this funny. No offense intended, it just struck me as a very engineering thing to say.

**The difficulty of Statistics training (24%)**

15% said that Statistics is very hard to teach, requires advanced math to understand, and some even said it's not a high school level course.

9% said that Statistics is too easy to bother having a full course dedicated to that topic

Taken together, I think this suggests that basic statistics instruction tends to be intuitive, but the progression to truly understanding statistics increases in difficulty extremely fast. To me, that suggests that although we may need more statistics in high school, the line for where that ends may be difficult to define. I will award a delta to the first top commenter in each category for this reason.

**Education-Based Responses (14%)**

5% said we already do this, or we already do this well enough that it doesn't need to change

3% discussed how the A-G-T model fits into a larger epistemological framework including inductive and deductive thinking - I did award a delta for this.

3% said that teaching stats poorly would actually harm students understanding of statistics and cause more problems than it would solve

1% said that if we teach statistics, too many students would simply hate it like they currently hate Trig - I did award a delta for this

1% said that Statistics should be considered a science course and not a math course - I did award a delta for this point as I do think it has merit.

**My Bad Wording (10%)**

10% of the arguments thought that I was suggesting that Algebra was unnecessary. This was my fault for sloppy wording, but to be very clear, I believe Algebra and Geometry are far too valuable to drop for any reason.

**Do Both (8%)**

8% said that we should just do both. I don't agree with this at all for most students. I've worked with far too many students that struggle with math and raising the bar any higher for them would simply cause more to struggle and fail. It would certainly benefit people to know both, but it may not be a practical goal.

**Other Countries (6%)**

5% said they live in countries outside of the US and their programs look more like what I'm suggesting where they are from.

1% said they live in countries outside of the US and don't agree that this is a good path.",kb6khu,"I think it would be cool and useful... can't really talk about the curriculum in us schools as I'm not from the us... in my country hs focuses more on algebra throughout, and calculus towards the end, trigonometry is something that's thought in middle school tho Idk if it's at the same level as in us highschools or more basic... now in my first year of uni I'm learning a bunch of economy related subjects including statistics and it's really cool... I'm gonna get an economic informatics or simply computer science with economy thrown in for good measure, and the faculty also offers a statistcs degree and a cybernetics degree, with this last one being a combination of statistics, computer science and economy that's really weird and people think it's the degree to sign up for if you want to become a programmer... but yeah I think highschools should focus more on economy related subjects, its good to teach us kids how the economy works and consequently the most importan thing of all for companies, profits... like god damn whenever our economy teachers asks us a question about companies the answer is always profits like jesus christ no wonder the world is so shit",gfi2t0r
"I am pro choice, but I can’t help but feel there’s some pro life arguments pro choicers don’t directly address.","First off I will say that I am pro choice. Why would I want my rights taken away from me? 

That said, I feel like some of the points pro lifers make are either ignored or tangentially addressed by pro choicers so I wanted to know what you guys think. 

Pro lifers love to call abortions “baby killing.” I don’t agree, but I honestly think people who call fetuses “clumps of cells” are missing the point. 

What the fetus is missing out on is their future life and personhood. I don’t think most prolifers consider a fetus nearly as developed as a born baby, rather they place the emphasis on the chance at life the fetus was robbed of. 

For example if a baby dies in a car crash, people say things like “they had very loving parents and a bright future ahead of them.” Why doesn’t that apply to fetuses? Just because they’re temporarily biologically dependant on their mother? 

I don’t think it’s fair to call them clumps of flesh or even compare them to tumours(a common argument I see all over Reddit). I mean, a tumour isn’t going to grow into a fucking person with emotions and self awareness. Yet redditors will go ballistic when humans are compared to objects in those dumb boomer memes. (To be fair they are dumb) 

Second point I feel isn’t really addressed is the “abortion is mostly used as birth control” argument. Rape victims definitely deserve the right to abortions if they want one, but I haven’t really seen pro choicers address the fact that MOST people use abortions as a form of birth control. If it’s used as birth control and if you consider a fetus a person, I feel the morality of aborting normal, non rape babies becomes mildly questionable. If you consider a fetus enough of a human being due to religion or whatever reason, you would essentially be weighing the importance of a life against a costly mistake. 

Third point is the “men have no say in women’s bodies” point. That makes sense if you consider a fetus a part of their mother’s body, but not if you consider a fetus a human. If you consider a fetus a human, the debate is no longer about women’s bodies, it’s human lives, and that concerns the entire human race. 

I feel like most pro choice arguments are only completely sound if you consider a fetus a 100% non living thing with 0 rights or desire to live. I haven't figured out how much of a person I consider fetuses yet, so I can't say much about that. 

Anyways I know this is a touchy subject so I tried to word it in the best way possible. I really hope I didn't sound completely ridiculous or upset anyone.


Edit: just woke up, this is gonna take a while to read. I want to clarify that my birth control point was that most people who get abortions are using it as birth control, not to prevent their body from collapsing. I obviously don’t think that people willingly have unprotected sex because “abortion is legal anyways.”",vf7bmy,"So the reason I don’t support the rape arguement in my decision is because over 96% of abortions are for convenience. 3.9% are medically necessary, and 0.1% (less really) are as a result of rape. 

It’s a statistical outlier, and protecting the other 96% of slain babies is more important than the less than 1/10th of 1% of women who have a child of a rapist. 

The difference in gestation between a newborn and a 25 year old is greater than conception to birth. 

Fetuses can have heart beats, brain function, experience pain while in the womb. They ARE humans, by every biological standard, and they ARE living at the point of conception by every biological standard.",icv055e
Republicans will hate Biden no matter what he does...,"I believe Republicans will hate Biden no matter what. Even if he doesn't take away their guns, even if he establishes rural broadband (which would disproportionately help them), even if he implements universal healthcare without raising taxes on the middle/lower class,,...

The reason I believe this is because it seems like Trump supporters are genuinely part of a cult. Even when Trump does something against their own principles, like a bum stock ban or raising the deficit significantly for example, he doesn't face even an iota of criticism from his own side. Recently, Trump supporters are even calling to abandon Fox News and move on to more right-wing networks like OAN, or get Trump and Tucker Carlson their own shows. This is all because Fox News refuses to irresponsibly platform election disinformation. It seems like they never cared about being politically informed or wanting what's best for this country, they just want to be fed what they want to hear, and they just want their side to win and trigger the other side.",jv71us,"Took me 36 years to realize this: Conservatives, in general, are actually just very bad people.",gcizlmo
The Great Gatsby is not a good book at all.,"I know that book preferences is a very subjective topic, but I still want to hear reasons for why some readers like The Great Gatsby. 

I’ve read the book twice, once while in HS and once in college when I was about 21 (I’m 23 now). I can’t for the love of me figure out why it is considered a classic or a good book at all. The characters are all boring and unlikeable (I understand that for some of the characters this is probably intentional), I can’t even really describe the plot to you, the symbolism of wealth and greed and the “American Dream” just falls flat to me. 

Now, the thing is, I DO usually enjoy classic books. My favorite book of all time is Les Miserables. I can even admire other classic books I don’t like that are heavy with symbolism too, like the Scarlet Letter. That was very difficult for me to finish but I understand the appeal and why the messages in the story matter. But The Great Gatsby? I just don’t get it. I’m open to learning why others do like it.",u30iw0,"I think the bigger issue is you were forced to read the book. I think just about every American highschooler is required to read this book because it is considered a classic. When you are forced to read something, it really makes you not want to read it. It’s hard to get into a book that you are forced to read. Another problem with the book is that it is completely on relatable to today’s teenagers. No teenager has lived in an era like that depicted in the book. So most of the events in the time period are just unrelatable to teenagers. I read the book in high school and hated it. But I read it probably 15 years after high school and kind of enjoyed it. I honestly don’t think this book should be taught or used in high school. Something to keep in mind: the Harry Potter books got more kids to read than any other book in history. That’s because the characters, story, and universe were interesting and relatable to teenagers.",i4opg9l
"Trump was never a politician, a racist, or even a populist. He was simply the most successful con artist in American history.","I do believe Trump is racist, but not any more racist that any other 75-80 year old man. At his very worst 30/40 years ago he’d be considered a liberal. 

Trump inherited a fortune, which adjusted for inflation would probably be less than his  current net worth. By all accounts he made some decent investments on real estate in the 70’s, albeit backed by tax payer money. However, all of his other business ideas and businesses for the next 2 decades flopped miserably. He may be the most litigated man in American history. 

By the early 90’s Donald Trump was a punch line in late night comedy shows. Banks wouldn’t loan him money, and he became more or less a B List celebrity. He was a professional wrestler, appeared in popular sitcoms, starred in Pizza Hut commercials, and made brief cameos in popular movies.

Ironically it was playing a successful businessman on a reality TV show that revived the viability of the Trump brand. The producer of the wildly successful Survivor series wanted to create a business world equivalent of Survivor, and wanted to use Trump for name recognition. Initially Trump thought of reality television as beneath himself, but thought of it as a free way to promote the Trump brand. Trump had been inept in the business world for 2 decades by this point, and the producer thought his office was tacky and dated to the 70’s so they built him a fake contemporary office. 

The show was wildly successful and marketed Trump to the masses as a successful businessman. He was able to make his brand solvent by licensing his name to properties the world over, and claiming he owned these properties with his name plastered everywhere. 
 
It was around this time that Barack Obama had succeeded the historically unpopular Bush 2. Trump made himself the political Skip Bayless. He opposed anything Obama from his birth certificate to his healthcare plan. He became a fixture on conservative news media for his anti Obama stances on everything.  

Trump became the darling of the Republican primaries. He said things other Republicans would only imply. There were a demographic of Americans that hated Obama and what he represented and Trump’s strategy was to tap into that hate. He famously promised to “ban all Muslims”, promised to build a border wall, and called Mexicans drug dealing rapists. He was all marshmallows no lucky charms. His years of pro wrestling and reality television made him the perfect political heel. Down to the chants and juvenile name calling. Pocahontas, Lying Ted, Sleepy Joe, “Build the Wall”, “Lock Her Up”…once he got some momentum he hired white nationalist Steve Bannon to be his top advisor and doubled down on everything that made him successful.

My theory is that Trump never intended to be president. He just wanted to shake up the system and promote his brand. Actually being elected president was a burden he didn’t anticipate. Ultimately being president revived the viability of his brand, and despite his comical incompetence he could hire qualified people to keep the machine operating. Once he acquired the highest level of celebrity and power he ever achieved power was not something he’d readily relinquish. The byproduct of his success is that the right has become a political sideshow, and their biggest celebrities are the most politically viable. The most batshit crazy right wing nuts have the biggest followings.",vsj74k,Not sure about that. Successful to me means getting away with it. I am not sure that will be true.,if68xln
Dating and finding a relationship is easier for the average woman compared to the average man,"Now, this isn't a post to bash women or how dating is easy for women. It's about how when you compare the experience of the average woman compared to the average man, it's easier for the woman to find dates and a relationship.

Let's start with an example from my personal life. Last year some friend of mine broke up. So far the woman has gone on multiple dates with three different dudes one after the other. Essentially when she decides that she doesn't like one guy she just moves on to the next one in less than a week. While my male friend hasn't had a single date so far and that's not due to a lack of trying. Now even though at the end of the day they are both still single, the women at least go on dates which mean she has a higher chance to find someone compared to the man who hasn't been on a single date.

This brings me to my first point. The average woman has a lot more options compared to the average man. I remember reading a survey that said that on average women are asked about 12 times a year compared to asking less than 1 guy out. And when we introduce online dating it gets even worse. On average a woman has a match rate of 30% while a man has 0.013%. This means that statistically, women have a lot more opportunities to meet the one compared to a man. More options are better than fewer options.

My second point comes down to the average dating strategy. The average woman is a lot more passive than a man, in the man is still the one doing the asking out and trying to impress the woman. This means that women have the option to just passively exist and they just pick and choose from their options. In addition to that, they always have the option of becoming proactive and going after the guys they want if they don't like their options. Compared that to the average guy whose only option is to actively go out looking for women and initiating stuff, since if he just stayed and waited for women to approach he will remain single.

And finally, there is the problem that till about the age of 54 there are just more men than women.",ukklxx,"I think the problem with your view is the vast, vast difference between dating and finding a functional relationship.

The dating situation for women is like getting the mail everyday, or an email account that you are required to keep cleaned.

You get all kinds of spam on a daily basis, sometimes you have to look a bit longer to see it's just trash that needs to be thrown away.  You also get crap that you just have to deal with like creepy co workers, these would be bills in our little comparison.

It's quite possible that the woman can miss an actual guy worth a relationship because she is dealing with a thousand other dudes that just want sex.

Even after she finds an SO, it's takes a ton of work on both sides to maintain and grow a relationship after the butterflies of those first two years or so dies down.  Relationships are hard work, but well worth it.

Yeah, men get a lot higher rejection rates for dates regardless of what they are looking for.  But they also have the ability to.put time and resources into getting that one special girl rather than dealing with all the noise.

All I am saying is that your view includes two things that really don't have much in common so you kind of have to pick one or the other.",i7s57ev
I find difficulty in supporting abortion.,"I want to make this thread as a genuine opportunity to see some info and get some opinions that can change my view, as i am clearly in the minority, especially on Reddit. I dont know if I’m missing something, but I just find it hard to support.

First, i need to point out that I am on board with abortions for things such as the health of the mother or child being compromised, rape, incest, those sort of situations. I also feel it may be necessary to point out that I am not a particularly religious person, I think I would fall in line with agnosticism.

I see many people saying to believe in science, and that saying that life begins at conception is blatant misinformation. I then found this;

https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3211703

So that part is concrete to me.

My other reasoning is I do feel it falls to accountability for actions. I’m not saying to be, and realize it is unrealistic to expect, abstinence across the board. But the thing is, we have many forms of protection, condoms, plan b, birth control, all very effective. I know that it isnt a guarantee, and if by chance that all fails, that is very unfortunate. But that is the risk everyone knows, and takes. Reproduction is literally the point of sex. Im not saying that is or should be the only reason people have sex, but that is what it is for. It seems entirely unfair and wrong to end an unborn child’s life, because you made a mistake, or an accident happened. The “my body my choice” view seems simply wrong due to it being the childs body, the childs life.

For me, and obviously cant speak for everyone who doesnt support abortion, it has nothing to do with supposedly trying to control womens bodies. Get your tubes tied, men can get their nuts snipped. I do not see any arguments (besides mentioned at the top) for getting an abortion, and yes, ending a babies life. Not being able to afford it, not wanting it, thats things you need to consider before hooking up with people, and make sure to take the proper precautions, and if it all fails, again that is unfortunate, but you know what the risk is. I find it completely unfair to just end the babies life because of a mistake or accident.

Where am I going wrong? What am I missing? To me this seems reasonable, but I am very clearly in the minority, and people like to think I’m some piece of shit who want to control women or something",vo8nwq,"Women should have control over their bodies.

People identify too much with being either an introvert or an extrovert,"I think most people are sometimes one and sometimes the other. Identifying too strongly as an introvert means that you miss out on things. Identifying too strongly as an extrovert makes you loud and obnoxious. 

The issue partially stems from people confusing being socially anxious or lacking social confidence with being an introvert. An introvert has no problem talking to people and can be a likeable person but likes to spend time on their own often. A socially anxious person is afraid of social interaction and feels panicked during social situations. The former is not a problem but the latter is.",f1u9h4,I'll try to change your view of a part you may not have expected.

juice cleanses shouldn't exist,"Look, I get it. Juice is yummy! But at best, juice cleanses are a waste of money and a perfectly good colon (which, by the way, doesn't need to be cleansed unless a doctor says it does so that they can look up it)! And at worst, they seem to be physically and mentally dangerous.

To be fair, I have never tried a juice cleanse and I only personally know one person who has, but I don't think juice cleanses won't help you lose weight (at least not permanently) or make your insides cleaner. But from what I've heard, what they can do is cause low blood sugar, sensitive teeth, kidney problems, liver problems, hypoglycemia, depression, diarrhea/gastrointestinal pain, infection, etc. You need calories of all sorts to function, and I'm just not convinced that you can get that from juice!

Maybe I'm just not informed enough and missing the hype, maybe juice cleanses aren't even a thing anymore- I was recently advised by my doctor not to try one because of my personal medical life. It was a one-off comment in the middle of a long email, but it got me thinking. Has anyone here actually done a juice cleanse and liked it/benefitted from it?

Students shouldn’t pick their classes based on what has the highest chances of getting them into college but rather what will be best for them in terms of their career path.,"
Example: A law major, picking physics over economics to get into a Ivy League school. 

Exemptions: Doing the classes in your own time rather then in school

Example: learning German, outside of school, for free education in Germany. 

I find that this is a pestilence in education systems all around the globe. With science majors doing math GCSE for the extra credit or engineering majors taking psychology GCSE, etc. 
The very fact that they are using countless hours to learn something that they won’t use in their career is the reason why so many people believe “you only keep x% of what you learn in school” and so on. It’s the reason why in many schools students are locked out from doing certain classes that they where planning on majoring in and the reason why students are so stressed. They think they have to get into that college, as if getting into the college is more important then what you learn to get there. 

However, maybe this is a smaller problem then I think or don’t realize how certain subjects are omni-helpful.

I'm starting to have an angry resentment towards migrants.,"I genuinely believe that part of a reason a country falters is because the best people often migrate, leaving less and less capable people in the nation.

For context, every time something terrible happens in my country, whether it be rampant corruption or the murderous superstorms and hurricanes that decimate us every few months, there's always talk of migrating. More often than not, these are usually the people with the money, experience, and resources to do something about it.

Right now, we're conducting elections in my nation and it looks like the infamously corrupt candidate who preys on the ignorance of the less fortunate with populist political tactics is leading. Already there are talks, mostly again from the more able, about migrating, instead of staying and doing something about it, and it's pissing me the F off.

It's getting bad to the point that if there's a tragedy, instead of talking about what can be done to improve or help, the immediate discussion is migration, and it makes my blood boil.

I know I shouldn't feel that way, I think I shouldn't at least but that is how I feel.

At-will employment needs to be modified," For  those who don't know, at-will employment is the concept that employers  and/or employees can terminate employment for any reason or even no reason at all.

However, that needs to be modified.

Employees should still have that freedom, but employers should not.

For those who are thinking ""but that's not fair."" It absolutely is.

If  an employee quits, there is little economic repercussion to the  employer. The employer is not ruined because an employee quits.

However,  if an employer fires an employee, that employee is ruined. S/he has no  income aside from the peanuts that are paid out by unemployment and could lose their house and damage their finances.

My  solution: It should be much more difficult for an employer to fire an  employee. All terminations initiated by the employee should have a  reason that is well-documented.

Example:  If an employer wants to fire an employee because the employee is ""not working out,"" then there should be verified documentation stating how and why they're not working out.

If  an employer wants to lay off employees, there needs to be presented  some financials and post-layoff projections that justify letting people  go.

If an employee breaks the  rules, document them breaking the rules and add a reference to the rule  in the employee handbook. (Pics are nice)

All  of this needs to be presented to your state's Department of Labor. If  they deem the termination to be unjust or the documentation insufficient, employee would be reinstated with back pay if applicable  and the termination is not allowed.",njxo1c,"People have a right to exit employment agreements at any time as you advocate for. People retain their rights when they act as a collective group. Companies are collectives of individuals acting as a group. Therefore, companies have the same rights as individuals when it comes to terminating a working relationship. You wanting to leave the group is not the group's fault. The fact that they've positioned themselves well enough to be minimally impacted by the loss of an employee shouldn't be held against them. That's like saying the employee with no savings account should be kept in favor of the one with the fully funded retirement account and savings. You're just punishing people for being responsible which is incredibly unfair.",gzv1wqz
Life after death doesn't exist.,"-EDITED FOR CLARIFICATION-

(EDIT) I know this is not the easiest thing to argue because unlike other positions, this one can't really be fought by statistics and such... I am NOT searching for concrete evidence of an afterlife... I am just asking why should I doubt there isn't, when IMO, I have more reason to doubt that there is. I am interested in the discussion more than anything. Sorry that I might have chosen a topic that's too open ended.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CMV there is no hard evidence to support that there's a heaven or a hell, or any sort of afterlife.

(EDIT) ^^^ Here I mean to say that I think there is more reason to believe there is no afterlife than there is to believe that there is.

At the end of the day we are animals. We live and die like one. I think humans tend to think we are smarter then we actually are. Our senses and nervous system can play tricks on us; I don't believe there is a whole other spirit realm. I feel the concept of an afterlife is just something humans invented to come to terms with death. We can't accept death, so we tell ourselves that we can never truly die. 

(idk personally, believing in life after death feels much more terrifying to me. The concept of eternal life would make me panic lol).

Common counter arguments I hear made about this:

-NDEs (Near death experiences): people who have almost died or died and came back to life often report seeing heaven. I think that *literally* dying is bound to have traumatic effects on your nervous system and yes that would cause visions I'm sure. Why heaven specifically? Because it's already embedded in our brains by our culture. We see what we expect to see. 

-Spiritual experiences under the influence: I honestly think this argument is dumb because you are taking hallucinogenic substances that alter your brain (LSD, shrooms etc), and then saying what you saw is proof of an afterlife? You saw a lot of things😂... Just because the walls look like they're moving doesn't mean that they are yknow?

-Past lives: When children seem to know things that ""they couldn't possibly know"". I think children are smarter than we give them credit for. You know how you say a cuss word just by accident around a toddler, and now that's their new favourite word? You only said it once, and they can parrot it back. Kids also have big imaginations. What Im saying is, Kids absorb the information around them, and can create whole fantasy worlds. I also think that those who have lost love ones start having a confirmation bias as a coping mechanism. They want it to be true. They don't want someone they loved to truly be gone, so they perceive that they live on through their children. Like I said, humans are not good at accepting death.

(EDIT) Say I accept that life after death is not 100% disproven, I still think there's enough indications for me to to say ""it doesn't exist"". I think of it like this. You walk into a grocery store. Is there a bear? There could be, you don't know... but why would there be? Many factors would have to be in play for a bear to be in a grocery store. Is it impossible? Well no... but I can feel pretty confident walking into a grocery store and saying there are no bears. 

Personally, for me to buy the ""you don't know"" argument, I would need something that convinces me to doubt more. So why should I doubt? CMV :)",ho9xs0,"&gt; At the end of the day we are animals. We live and die like one.

Nudity is sexual,"I feel like a lot of places I go on the internet there’s nude bodies, or naked candles, or photos of naked people, and people say that they aren’t sexualized, and I just don’t understand that at all, like, how is it not sexual? We basically do only 3 things when we’re naked, change clothes, shower, and have sex, which one do we do most often? Definitely not changing, twice a day, let’s say 2 minutes each is 4 minutes, so basically nothing, I’m not sure exactly how much people have sex but I’m guessing every 1-3 days, and I’m guessing the average is 10-15 minutes, and I’m guessing the average shower length is around that as well, we shower every day aswell, so yes technically sex isn’t the most common thing we do while naked, but still, it isn’t too far behind, and showers can be sexualized, many people have sex in the shower (although not a majority) and lots and lots of people think that bodies covered in water is hot.

So, basically when you’re naked, it’s mostly sexual, so then how is a nude not sexual? I just don’t get it, I want to be more respectful, but I just don’t understand it wouldn’t be sexualized.

There is no such thing as objective moral truth.,"I think all morality is subjective. There is no objective way to determine whether something is right or wrong. All moral claims such as ""murder is wrong"" or ""stealing money from somebody for no reason is wrong"" or ""Saving an innocent life is morally right"" cannot be objectively justified. Humans define morality. If all life was gone synthetic statements could not be true because there would not be a human to add value to the statement. If humans were gone, 2 hydrogen molecules would still come together to make 2(1+1=2) but murder wouldn't be ""wrong"". (Obviously we can't be certain 1+1=2 would still be true but I'm operating under a materialist framework)",cbc89d,"All of our moral actions arise from consciousness. We are physical beings in a physical universe operating from physical consciousness. To me, it seems logically straightforward that consciousness ought to be explainable via physical means. We don't yet have the machinery to disentangle all the variables at play, but I also don't see why it should be impossible. 

You admit that we have a degree of uncertainty in claims like 1+1=2. Yet presumably you're okay with calling this objective truth, so long as you prescribe a philosophical framework. So why not permit this same leniency to morality? Under certain framework, I think we can determine that morality is objective. 

Absolute objectivity doesn't exist, not even in math. I think we apply an unfair burden on morality in this regard.",etel0im
"Success in education is a measure of conformity, not intelligence","The purpose of the education system is not to enlighten or inspire, it is to create pliable drones for companies to exploit in the workplace. At a base level this is about merely turning up - you go somewhere you don't want to go, you do something you don't enjoy doing, then you do the same the next day. If you fail to do this, in some countries you can  drop out of school and struggle to accomplish anything in later life, in my country (UK) your parents will be prosecuted and sent to *prison* if you don't turn up. Children learn this unspoken lesson quickly - you adapt to this grind or bad things will happen.

Passing exams in most subjects does not require a great deal of intelligence. Subjects like georgraphy, history, English, religious studies, art, physical education, etc, are a cakewalk. All they require is listening to what the teacher says (after all, they see the tests every year and know what's included in them, they practically tell you the answers) and a reasonable memory to recall it all. Taking notes at the time and reading them before the test is a foolproof way of doing this. What is required of the student is not knowledge or creative thinking - it is doing what you are told and remembering what you are told, whether you agree with it or not.

This goes some way to explaining pro-establishment biases of journalists. When they trade a college professor for a well-paid boss (working under a millionaire media mogul) doing what is expected of them is second nature. Bland, neutral articles do not sell copies, so making them more eye-catching with a clickbait style is not seen as a compromise on  ethics, just a recognition of the competitive marketplace. Soon the journalism student is writing incendiary articles about Iraq's *vast arsenal of WMDs*, merely repeating what they saw an authority figure say on TV (as they have unquestioningly repeated statements from teachers on tests), each article becoming more exaggerated to gain more clicks/sales. Due to a  combination of pride/defensiveness in their work, overexposure to one side of the debate, repetition, ingrained fealty, and lack of personal convictions, the establishment narrative is quickly adopted as the subject's own personal view.

This phenomena seen in politicians, journalists and many regular students (particularly those in higher education) is the banality of evil effect. Many of these people don't necessarily set out to provoke wars or become mouthpieces of big business, they are just doing what is expected of them, they are following the pattern of behaviour they've learned over a lifetime.

That's not to say there aren't hard subjects in academia. Maths and sciences take a lot of intelligence at high levels. People who succeed in these areas are all smart. However, there are smart people who've never done these subjects at a high level, and one of the differences is conformity -  people who are willing to jump through hoops, people who are willing to eat shit, and people who aren't.",cfo38m,"Saying something is easy is the hallmark of having not tried it, or not understanding it.

Everyone should be an organ donor with very few exceptions.,"So that’s pretty much it. According to the HRSA, “More than 120,000 people in the U.S. are waiting to receive a life-giving organ transplant. We simply don't have enough donated organs to transplant everyone in need, so we balance factors of: justice (fair consideration of candidates' circumstances and medical needs)”.

120,000 people. 

Man, women and children. 120,000 families, 120,000 sets of friends, 120,000 small communities of support all hinging on the kindness of someone living far far away.

8,000 people DIE EVERY YEAR because somewhere 8,000 people were too ignorant or too selfish to fill out the paperwork or check the box before buying a motorcycle. It’s such a damn shame and completely preventable! If you’re dead you have no need for your organs so it is silly ignorant and extremely selfish to not donate them if you’re eligible.

Really the only exception that I see here would be people who are ineligible to donate because they are too old or sick shouldn’t be organ donors. But for healthy people with healthy organs, the idea that they wouldn’t donate their organs upon eligible death is a colossal injustice when you compare the need of people seeking them for highly successful procedures.",jr19ip,"&gt;8,000 people were too ignorant or too selfish to fill out the paperwork or check the box before buying a motorcycle.

I don't think it's accurate to say that people are necessarily being ""selfish"" and ""ignorant"" by not filing out the paperwork.

When I originally got my Driver's Permit at age 15, I didn't opt in to being an organ donor. At the time, it felt like an incredibly personal and large choice. I was not making a fully educated choice: I hadn't been told that most people do it, or what the implications of the decision were for myself or other people. When the woman behind the counter asked me if I wanted to be an organ donor, I felt scared. I imagined myself in a car crash, then being wheeled into a hospital to get my organs cut out from my lifeless body.  It was a harrowing image, and gave me a lot of anxiety. So I said ""no"" and I didn't become an organ donor. I made the decision because I was 15 and I was scared.

The next few weeks after getting my permit, I talked with my mom and my friends about why they were organ donors, and I changed my mind. When I got my license a year later, I opted in. I had learned more, and made an informed decision.

If opting in was the default, I think I still would have opted out when getting my permit. I didn't know enough about the implications of the decision, so I did what felt best for me. I don't think that makes me selfish, or purposefully ignorant.

Perhaps the better solution would be to put more money into PSAs about the implications of checking that box.",gbqxe03

Especially if you are attempting to run to become President of the USA. To do this there has to be concessions and compromises, and you can't realistically push for a total overhaul of everything.

As someone who is pretty left-wing, I think it's a reasonable tactic. Triage the areas that you want to socialize based on how big of an issue they are, right? Healthcare, education, climate change - big ticket issues. And Sanders' solution in each of these realms is opposed to market forces. It's incrementalist, but certainly everything he is doing in those realms is anti-capitalist.

The other way to look at this would be to say who would you support if you were an anti-capitalist? Well, you would support the candidate that is the most anti-capitalist and in line with your values as you thought had a reasonable shot of winning. Folks who are anti-capitalists are strongly in favour of Sanders. And this isn't like them choosing Clinton because she is the least worse option, this is them backing a candidate who they see as informed by a similar ideology. So that would lead me to believe that Sanders' vision is pretty close to what anti-capitalists want to achieve.",felr9p6
Modern hip hop takes less talent to be successful than 10+ years ago,"I am trying hard not to be a grumpy old man (still just in my 30s). I want to respect the fact that my parents told me the same stuff when they heard my music blasting out of my bedroom. Their parents with them as well.

There are some caveats I have to submit to personally, though - and some things you may (or may not) have to consider:

I grew up on 80's and 90's hip-hop. Times when it was fighting to break through to the mainstream. There were also acts pushing new boundaries and creating new standards. Hip Hop was at the forefront of the censorship and music battle, with acts like Ice T, NWA, and 2 Live Crew suffering heavy political targeting.

Also, at that time, the music spoke to me as a young, energetic, aggressive young man that saw the whole sex, money, cool factor as something to aspire to. 

Hip Hop was hypermasculine, homophobic, and tightly culturally policed. 

Until Death Row and Bad Boy really broke, most Hip Hop that made top 40 was considered corny.

They broke a mainstream dam. And then Eminem broke another.

Then, a few years back, Jay Z teased retirement. The reason he gave was ""rap is a young man's game."" Yet, he's still going, and going strong. There are a good handful of rappers still active in their 40's and beyond.

Add to that, the loss of importance of record companies as gatekeepers to distribution and exposure.

All we are seeing is another barrier being broken.

Hip Hop isn't worse: it's free from the cornucopia of financial and cultural restraints it bloomed under - and it's surrounding culture is slowly evolving with it. And, with any such movement, we old folks are tellin them damn kids to get off our lawn.",etoyb58
Cabinet members resigning at this point are doing so out of cowardice instead of a moral obligation,"With the breaking news that Elaine Chao is resigning her post as Secretary of Transportation, I can't help but think that it is an empty gesture at best, and a cowardly avoidance of participating in invoking the 25th Amendment at worst. 

It is my understanding that in order to invoke the 25th, Vice President Pence would need to receive a majority vote from all cabinet members. That is made more difficult when one or more cabinet member(s) that clearly recognize the danger that Trump's mental instability poses resign from their post. 

I understand that there is just 13 more days until Biden is sworn in, but the events of the past few days have established that the safety and security of our Democracy necessitates the removal of Trump from power lest he cause more chaos. The Republican party needs to send a clear message to their supporters that this kind of behavior will not stand, and attempts to overthrow democratically elected leaders will be met with quick and harsh punishments.

**EDIT**

To address some commonly suggested things:

* Pence does have to agree to the 25th, but does not have to initiate it. A majority of the cabinet going public with their support would/could likely persuade him to get on board, especially people like DeVos or Mnuchin who have the kinds of networks he would need to stay in politics after all this.

* In terms of procedure, yes Congress would have to agree. However, once the VP and cabinet agree, Trump would have his presidential powers limited/removed until the votes potentially knock down the 25th, which could take up to 21 days.

**2nd EDIT**

Avoid the whataboutism. I keep seeing people try to equate these riots to the BLM protests that devolved into looting. These are not very similar circumstances. With the BLM protests, nearly all of the violence was initiated by police. In the Capitol, the police allowed the protestors turned rioters to storm the capital, moving barriers for them and were subsequently rewarded with one of their officers being beaten to death.",ksl2fy,I think they're just trying to jump ship before the Trump administration gets taken to court,gijaelp

Social media should not be regulated by the government to stop the proliferation of fake news.,"After the Capitol Riots and then Biden's election this past January, discussions in relation to repealing Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act have increased. This act protects social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter from being held responsible (legally) for their users' posts. If repealed, millions of users across these platforms could be censored by the government or the platforms themselves to avoid legal backlash. If users aren't censored they could be held financially or legally responsible for posting the fake or supposedly harmful content. In my view, this could lead to self-censorship across these platforms as users may be scared of potential repercussions.

While I do consider myself a firm independent who may be a tad bit more left leaning, I fear that if this regulating (or censoring,) is left in the hands of the government or the private companies, it will most likely effect people on both sides of the aisle. Those with contrarian views that differ from big corporate and big government might have their content removed without repercussion or legal leg to stand on. From my perspective the right has the most obvious proliferation of fake news, but if one side with power begins censoring, what may be censored next?

Even if we cannot cut demand for oil and oil products to zero, we should and we can reduce it significantly through a combination of switching to renewables, increasing efficiency of our transportation systems, increasing efficiency of engines, making fundamental changes to how our cities are laid out etc. A renewables powered  future would also potentially reduce economic inequality as energy sources wouldn’t be as concentrated geographically and politically. We wouldn’t have to fight as many stupid wars for oil either. So no matter what your stance on the oil industry is in the present, you have to agree that this industry should start a period of decline atleast in terms of net output in barrels produced and in terms of number of people (except engineers) employed on it.",dmil07,What is your main objective for this plan?,f54aw1l
Christians should be able to view transgenderism and homosexuality as sinful without it being labeled bigotry or a phobia.,"EDIT (READ BEFORE COMMENTING): At this point, I'm realizing it's going to be hurtful to at least some degree to someone in the LGBTQ for me to have a Christian worldview.  There's more to it than that, just message me if you want more info.  It's hard at this point to keep up with the replies and most are just rehashing the same thing at this point, so I've given up trying to reply to them all.  Thanks to everyone who made this a positive experience of learning!

&amp;#x200B;

This is in response to another post, as I found that this was really the biggest issue with my view.  For those coming from that pose, hopefully this gives better context.

I have some close gay friends, so this is a concern for me as someone who has strong religious beliefs. I'm worried that if they were to ask me about my views and I told them, they would no longer want to be friends.  I think we should be able to be friends, but I get that it’s quite tricky since I’m basically admitting to thinking a major part of their lifestyle is wrong.

Christians (the real ones) don't hate people because they are trans or gay.  But I think the problem people have with Christians' view on this is that it is in a sense (or maybe completely) denying a trans person's chosen identity. I'm curious if it's possible for a Christian to hold the view that transgenderism is a sin without it upsetting or being problematic for trans people.

My main thought process through this is: what if my LGBTQ friend asked me what my view on it all was? What would my honest response be? And is there a way that we could still be friends afterward? This is my concern going in. I'm not trying to get rid of my LGBTQ friends, but I'm also not willing to lie about what I believe.

As a Christian, I don’t have a problem with being close friends with people within the LGBTQ community.  I don’t want to or plan to go around telling random people on the street my religious beliefs on the matter.  I think that’s unproductive and harmful because it’s not ever going to be seen as coming from a place of love or respect for them as a person.  Is that also going to have to be the case with my gay friends?

I know this is controversial, so I’m thanking those in advance who choose to try to understand my view and discuss it with me.

Thanks,

The term 'white' privilege shouldn't exist.,"Before I get flamed: I'm Southeast Asian and middle income.

I'm willing to change this view if my inquiry is proven wrong or if the logic is proven shaky or fallible.

I have two issues with 'white' in the context of race.

The first being, there is no scientific evidence to suggest white people are genetically or biologically related. A person of West Slavic origin is genetically different from a person of Tunisian origin, a person of Finno-Ugric descent is genetically different from a person of Northern Germanic descent. Same with how you cannot lump black people together as a person of West African descent is entirely different genetically from a person of Ethiopian descent.

Second, the term white is vague. What delineates white people from other races where their appearance is slightly different but not entirely? If this was the case then wouldn't Tunisians, Hungarians, Albanians, Finnish, Sicilians, Spaniards of moorish descent, be considered non-white or white? Racially classifying people is an asinine cause because each time you jump to the border of a country you'd see that races are usually mixed and blurs the lines on a specific race.

Is the definition of white considered to be tied to imperialistic old world powers with racially white physical characteristics, further citing the historicity of the matter? If that was the case then, Irish, Welsh and Scottish natiobalist and independence movements throughout history are essentially anti-White which would mean that  people who descend from those heritages are non-white. 

Unless the definition of white is formalized and has some sort of basis on hard sciences rather than being a social construct, then use of white (and any other racial term like black, yellow, asian) should be banned or discouraged in use. At the very least treading lightly on the subject matter.

Privilege on the other hand, does exist especially in a number of countries where majority of the wealthy are concentrated on a minority. That being said, white privileges as a result of them being white is just furthering the narrative of white ultra nationalists that white people do have privileges over other races. At the same time, white privilege's historicity is often cited, where people blame white people on committing treacherous acts of exploitation and subjugation.

In that regard, imperialism is not endemic to white people. The Aztecs practiced ritual mass human sacrifice from captured slaves. The highland head hunters (Igorot) of the Malayan archipelago practiced head hunting and raiding. The Arabs practiced slavery, furthering the practice into the Malayan Archipelago where the islands of Sulu became a slave trading and pirate hub. Native Africans procured slaves by way of conquest and ethnic cleansing, which they then sold to European merchants (see: African slave trade). The empire of Akkad in the middle east was the first empire in history.

The old world European powers which colonized and subjugated native populations are just a scaled up version under a long line of conquerors and imperialists. Blaming it on racial privilege is nonsense.",i0i0ls,"From your responses to other comments, I feel that your view can be simplified to: ""Yes there is a thing such as privileges enjoyed by certain groups and classes of people, but attaching the term 'white' to the term 'privilege' is not the way to refer to this issue."" Correct me if I'm wrong?

Now, I feel that the main point here is your stance on logic vs. how the term is *generally* used and understood. In countries where 'white privilege' is a huge issue, educated people would understand that the term does not refer to 'white' people as a race by itself. Rather, it's a simplified way of saying 'a lot of people of mainly European descents are currently enjoying unfair advantages over others in many fields'.

I agree that if you look at the term from just the wordings itself, it makes no sense to refer to the issue using 'white privilege'. However, remember that words can be used in many ways, and what matters more is the context behind it and the *general understanding* of it, not just strictly the pure definition of the words themselves.",fzpxb1g
Trump and McConnell Must Not Be Allowed to Replace RBG," 

After    Mitch McConnell said that we can't replace Supreme Court nominees    during election years, it would be extremely hypocritical to try and    replace RBG now. If a president who was elected by big margins in both    the popular vote AND the electoral college TWICE couldn't do it, then a    president who lost by three million votes cannot. If a president whose    administration was free from scandal cannot do it, then an impeached    president who lied about all of the most important issues of our day  and who has most likely   conspired with foreign adversaries while  spreading disinformation about and   questioning the legitimacy of our elections cannot do it.

Here are McConnell's words from 2016 and they all apply today:

 **""Given that we are in the midst of the presidential election  process, we believe that the American people should seize the  opportunity to weigh in on whom they trust to nominate the next person  for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court,""** they  conclude. ""It is today the American people, rather than a lame-duck  president whose priorities and policies they just rejected in the  most-recent national election, who should be afforded the opportunity to  replace Justice Scalia."" 

Trump, who is trailing in the polls and will likely lose a free and fair election is the definition of a lame duck. His policies were resoundingly ""rejected in the most recent national election"" of 2018. 

That is inarguable and you aren't going to change my view on that.

However,    we all know Trump and McConnell are doing to push this through  anyway.   What I do want you to change my view on is that they must be  stopped  by  any and all nonviolent means necessary from accomplishing  their  goal.

The  first, most  obvious  route is to pressure the hell out of our senators  to not allow  it to  happen. I have zero faith that enough GOP senators  (2? 3?) will  go this  route. You cannot change my view that this is what  would be  best for  the country because it is.

However,    Trump will submit a nominee. McConnell will ram it through. At that    point, I believe it is up to the American people to prevent that  nominee   from ever taking  a seat on the bench, even if that means  nonviolent   resistance and sitting in front of the Supreme Court by the  thousands   and even millions to keep it from happening. Yes, that  would mean civil   disobedience. That would mean violating the law in  some cases. But it   must be done. A vocal, divisive minority cannot  impose their will on   this country for a generation. A commander in  chief who is clearly   incompetent and unfit to hold office cannot  appoint THREE Supreme Court   justices just because no one in his party  will stand up to him.

**Trump    and McConnell cannot replace RBG unless he wins  completely free and    fair election and the Republicans retain control of the Senate the  same  way. If they try to replace her BEFORE that happens then we, the   people,  must make sure it does not come to pass.**

**Change my view because I don't like where this takes me. But I think it is the moral and just way right now.**",ivzowf,"\&gt; Trump, who is trailing in the polls and will likely lose a free and fair election is the definition of a lame duck. His policies were resoundingly ""rejected in the most recent national election"" of 2018. 

What do you mean by resoundingly rejected in the most recent national election of 2018? You mean the election where the Republicans under Trump retained the Senate? Where they even gained 2 senators?

\&gt; Trump, who is trailing in the polls and will likely lose a free and fair election 

 Rasmussen Reports, the [most accurate](https://thehill.com/media/306721-rasmussen-calls-itself-most-accurate-pollster-of-2016) poll ahead of the 2016 presidential election, in their Daily Presidential Tracking Poll shows Trump with a total approval of 52 percent on September 16, two points ahead of Barack Obama eight years ago when he was cruising to reelection. 

Why do you think Trump wont win the election?  What do you mean by free and fair election?

\&gt;  What I do want you to change my view on is that they must be stopped by any and all nonviolent means necessary from accomplishing their goal. 

Why must they be stopped? They are following all the legal and constitutional requirements. Why do you think anything at all needs to be done in the first place?

\&gt; . A commander in chief who is clearly incompetent and unfit to hold office cannot appoint THREE Supreme Court justices just because no one in his party will stand up to him. 

So incompetent that he presided over one of the largest periods of economic growth in decades, has just made 3 historic peace agreements, been nominated twice for the Nobel prize, and was just awarded the national medal of freedom by a muslim majority country.

What do you mean ""no one in his part will stand up to him""? Appointing judges and Justices was one of his core republican talking points to get elected! Why would they need to ""stand up"" to a president appointing conservative judges?

Do you think appointing conservative judges is grounds for civil disobedience and crime?

Natural gas is a necessity in any electric grid,"I support renewables like solar, wind, and hydro, but California continues to show that they cannot be the only energy source if you also want a reliable power grid. 

Renewables, besides hydro, cannot change energy output levels fast enough or reliably enough to support large swings of power demand. 

Increasing hydro generation requires more dams to be built, which are currently shown to negatively impact the environment. 

There’s no other energy source that provide power within 10 minutes of being called upon and be able to run indefinitely. Solar will degrade and the panels will have a large disposal cost in 20-30 years. Same principle with batteries which cannot provide indefinite power generation. 

I don’t see a way to completely eliminate fossil fuels from the energy sector",c0qpw0,"Wait? Are you saying California is the only power producer in the area? Because ordinarely how power grid works is that different area's support different ""parts of the world"" depending on the electricity demands. Since electricity moves about a 1/100th of a speed of light in a power grid it can be anywhere virtually instantly. With the transmition loss you get a range about 2500 km which is about the distance between California and Illinois directly. Which puts California in reach of well over half of US states.

So right now all of those states share electricity needs. As you cannot exactly store electricity at such volumes, which means at different time of the day a good chunk of power is given to you by other states. Now, renewable sources like solar or electric are perfectly reliable. And by reliable in this context we mean that they are built at such volumes that barring extreme tornado-esq conditions they will always provide the necessary output.

There is no problem to become entirely clean energy dependent. Instead of building just one coal power plant, you built solar or wind farms at such volumes, that you satisfy all of the energy means. It's not even more expensive, the initial cost in materials is saved due to the non-existence of combustible materials.

And there is no such thing as entirely inhospitable environment for any option, such that it would make clean energy virtually impossible. So there is not really an issue, other than people's / investors skepticism and of course the corporations benefiting from status quo.",er9rtf9

We are over thinking the housing crisis. Just incentivize the building of more homes.,"This isn’t my area of expertise, so there’s a chance that my mind will be changed in record time. However, I keep hearing about subsidized housing, rent control, and low income housing. From my perspective, the solution is to deemphasize these programs and go all-in on encouraging the private sector to build new apartments and condos…a LOT of them. Whether it is through tax incentives, eminent domain, changes in zoning, or the auctioning of public land to developers, an increase in inventory will stop prices from skyrocketing and will hopefully drive them down. Supply and demand. 

I don’t mind adding in some stipulations that a portion of new construction has to go to low income families, but the focus should be shovels in the ground. If the inventory is high enough, there won’t be as great of a need for subsidies, rent control, or dedicated low income housing. I don’t even care if most of the new construction is targeted for the wealthy. As everyone moves up a level, there will be increased inventory at the bottom of the price scale. 

The approach should be similar to the Fed and interest rates, how they change the rates to address needs in the economy. If housing prices start to rise faster than inflation, then highly incentivize the construction of new units. If home prices drop too much, pull back the incentives. 

I think the roadblock to this plan is wealthy real estate developers and current homeowners who don’t want to see their investments DECREASE in value. These people don’t mind that others are struggling to find affordable housing, and since the wealthy developers influence politics, all we get are programs that look good from a distance but don’t solve the real problems.",uwdr0m,"I see the housing market and gas the same way I see the cherry farming market. Cherries need a long winter and a slow thaw to bloom, but cherry farms or big farms that sell cherries aren't allowed to  sell more then what there contracted to sell, by the FDA and DepOfAg that if they have a surplus it either is considered destroyed product or they just can't sell it.  this left them with dumping back out to use int the soil. 

The reason it's this way is because it was deemed that the market stores had the right to determine the prices of cherries within reason and lobbyists we're convincing enough to the those departments that a surplus on  the market would be bad because this would indefinitely lower prices. The federal administrations and departments were bought to keep the prices high by not letting the existence of surplus known.

If there is a surplus of low income housing that is used with conjunction with low in come or welfare programs then the same would likely be true causing realty companies to focus on getting low value houses to people at a faster rate rather then big properties for only monthly paying chunks. 

Or at least that's how I see it.",i9tny1y
"As if now, we cannot blame religious people for voting for anti-abortion laws.","**Edit:** as my view has already been changed I won't be arguing further. Thanks to the Delta receivers

Abortion is a very complicated matter that I feel like Reddit likes to sum with things like ""basic healthcare"" and ""my body my choice"".

The abortion argument boils down to the definition of a life. ""My body my choice"" wouldn't be a valid argument if, hypothetically, the fetus was considered to be a life. At what point is a life created? The second the egg is fertilized, is that a ""life"" now? If that's the case, does masturbating murder a life? What's the difference between a sperm and a fertilized egg? Why is it that the second an egg is fertilized, it's a life?

Conversely, on the ""pro-choice"" side of the argument, when does this infant become a life? The second it's out of the womb? What's the difference between that and a fetus? Where do we draw the line? Is pain and conciousness the most important factor? Once the baby starts to feel pain and/or is ""conscious"" (which is a very vague, non-objective term at this stage), is abortion murder at that point?

I didn't ask these questions to question their side, I asked these questions to introduce religion. At this point, religion comes to play. Most, if not all, major religions give a definition of life, soul, and conciousness. If a Christian considers the fetus a life form, how can we blame them? Subjectivity draws the line between ""abortion"" and ""murder"", and for many, their religion, a subjective truth, is the pencil. Conversely, what right do Christians have do deny non-believers abortion based off of their subjective beliefs?

You cannot blame Christians for relating abortion to murder, nor can you blame atheists for not. Personally, I would vote pro-abortion. But would I blame a Christian for telling me I'm supporting murder? Not really, no. Until:

* Religions that define a life become extinct OR
* There is solid scientific evidence concerning the definition of a life and the concept conciousness

, both sides are correct. While this is supported by a neutral stance, feel free to change my view that we cannot call religous people inhumane for trying to deny abortion rights, as they are trying to stop what they consider a life being stolen.",nytz17,"&gt;""My body my choice"" wouldn't be a valid argument if, hypothetically, the fetus was considered to be a life. At what point is a life created? The second the egg is fertilized, is that a ""life"" now? If that's the case, does masturbating murder a life? What's the difference between a sperm and a fertilized egg? Why is it that the second an egg is fertilized, it's a life?

This is a severe misunderstanding of what that slogan means. It means that nobody but you is allowed to make any choices for your own body. A fetus is inside of, attached to, and using your body. You have the freedom to choose if you want it to do that, even if it will die.

&gt;Conversely, on the ""pro-choice"" side of the argument, when does this infant become a life? The second it's out of the womb? What's the difference between that and a fetus? Where do we draw the line? Is pain and conciousness the most important factor? Once the baby starts to feel pain and/or is ""conscious"" (which is a very vague, non-objective term at this stage), is abortion murder at that point?

I'd day whether or not it's a life or when it becomes one is irrelevant. The biggest difference between a fetus and infant is birth, when it is capable of independent function. Abortion (if done willingly) cannot be considered murder at any stage simply because it does not fit the description.",h1m2wvj

Ranked choice voting won't actually fix anything in US politics.,"Ranked choice voting is hailed as the solution to the mess that is the two party system. While there are significant advantages to this system (e.g. allowing voters to vote by conscience, reducing the impact of the spoiler effect, ensuring the majority of an area supports the winner), there are also flaws within the system. [This article outlines Australia's usage of single winner ranked choice voting has still allowed a two party system to prevail.](https://democracyjournal.org/arguments/ranked-choice-voting-is-not-the-solution/) Ranked choice voting can also still be affected by gerrymandering and votes are still wasted.

"Transgenderism is mentally unhealthy for all involved, especially with regard to physical transitioning","UPDATE: My view has been changed thanks to some very intelligent, level-headed folks that I've spoken to on this sensitive subject. Although not 100% reversed, my opinion through this process has been changed. I hope that everyone felt as though I engaged them with respect in a fully conversational tone. I made profuse efforts to do so. On that point, it should be known by all participants that if a redditor is breaking the rules, you aren't allowed to tell them to stop, apparently. You aren't allowed to tell them why or how their statement is inappropriate, no matter how matter-of-fact it is and no matter how neutral your tone. You aren't allowed to tell them, no matter how neutral the statement, that they should seek a better approach. You aren't allowed to tell them that they should seek to be more emotionally detached. You aren't allowed to tell them to stop engaging you, either. You are, apparently, beholden to abuse the report button in this format, thereby breaking a rule of the site as a whole, since no other sensible option will stop the mods from deleting your comments and accusing you of things you are not guilty of. No matter what you do to try to get the mods to describe exactly what it is that you may have said that violated a rule they won't tell you and will just stomp their feet like little children. It's truly a sad state for a sub with such a great format and respectable intentions. Mods, if you want people to participate freely in this kind of format, if you want to retain any integrity, you are beholden to backing up your claims like everyone else under any post on your sub. Your approach with me was utterly ridiculous and I have no idea still why you deleted my comment only because you refused to engage me in as intellectually sound, respectable and emotionally detached manner that you require from everyone else. 

It's analogous to accepting an anorexic's belief that they're too thin. The rationale for both transgenderism and anorexia are that they're built on social constructs that fluctuate depending on era and/or society. Both are in denial of physical realities and attempt to change that physical reality by trying to shape objective reality to meet their internal desires rather than accepting objective conditions. This is something no medical provider would ever do with an anorexic, even if there was a safe way of doing it (also analogous to heroin addiction, or people hearing voices in their heads). People playing along are reinforcing their disconnect from reality and fostering unfair demands on other people to do the same by shaming them.

Transgenderism wants to have things both ways (no pun intended) by saying that gender is only a social construct and also, somehow, that it's diagnosable on a psychiatric level. If it's a social construct then there should be no sexual dimorphism that lend men and women different roles. Men and women are physically different for biological duties whether they're ever realized or not, and there's no denying that. If it's only a social construct then what need is there for physical transitioning?

It reverses the work put in for decades by the homosexual community that says that social constructs \*aren't\* the determinant of gender. Many parents who are introducing their children to transitioning early are doing so on the basis that they seem to do things that are traditionally not appropriate to their sexual gender assignment. The homosexual community finally has experienced some liberation on this level and established that just because a man likes other men sexually or other things that straight women like that it doesn't mean that he isn't a man, or that just because a woman likes other women and tends to like things that straight men like that they aren't women. The transgender movement uses exactly these things to rationalize young children being transitioned.

The part of the trans movement that believes that young children should be allowed to choose to transition are (perhaps without realizing it) destroying the argument for the age of consent. Anyone who can be trusted to make a permanent physical change to their body at a very young age age must, naturally, be able to choose to have whatever sexual experience they wish to have. If not, they are making the irrational argument that a permanent choice is less of a commitment than a temporal one.

If it's not simply a social construct and it can be diagnosed, then there should be plenty of examples of people who are diagnosed with it who think of themselves as cis-gendered. If it was a legitimate condition that could be diagnosed such as something like schizophrenia, there should be plenty of doctors who, independently, can look at a case study and determine the treatment with some degree of consensus.

Finally, it demands untenable things from the rest of the world in a few ways:

It demands that the rest of the world play along. How is transgenderism not a way of inflicting a psycho-sexual fantasy on the rest of the world? Transgendered people have a sexual fantasy of being accepted as something they aren't. Now it's become a social rule in modern 1st world countries that if we don't role-play with them in this walk-around fantasy that \*we\* are the ones that are inflicting \*our\* interests onto \*them\* and I have a lot of trouble seeing it any other way. It's pretty gross, too.

Pronouns aren't personal. That's not how language works or is supposed to work. No one remembers pronouns because the subconscious practice of determining another organism's sex is many, many millions of years more deeply ingrained than bipedalism, and even primates generally. The language that we use associated with that is hardwired far below the conscious mind, so it isn't a choice to mis-gender someone.

There's a flaw within transgenderism revealed by this: It discriminates against people who can't pass post-transition. If you think you're a man because you have a short haircut and manage to grow a mustache but you still look like a girl, no one's going to call you a man. Your life as a man will continue to be unfulfilled. There's nothing you'll ever be able to do about being misgendered if you look like Margot Robbie but demand to to be addressed as a man.

Transgendered people, whether or not they ascribe to the diagnosable or social construct theories around it, can never truly be the other they choose because part of being what we are has to do with the process of growing up as that thing. No one who grows up as a female, lives as a female, and is protective of their body the way females are will ever understand the rough and tumble nature of how most men interact through a lifetime of gender-specific horse-play.

In effect all it does is render the term ""gender"" meaningless. It has no definition if it isn't linked to biological sex.

These points are most of what I think about when it comes to transgenderism. CMV by changing my opinion on them. I won't respond to arguments coming from the perspective of birth defects as they are in too severe a minority to warrant large-scale societal reform.

I feel I should add that this is in no way an argument against anyone living in exactly the way they want to, so long as they don't force anyone else to participate in their fantasies. The thought that anyone sees alternative lifestyles like furries, homosexuality, transgenderism, or any form of queerness as a reason for ridicule, judgement or limiting their inalienable rights as humans is 100% inexcusable and I will absolutely fight for you to live in safety and enjoy your freedoms. This is solely an exercise in testing the logical underpinnings of transgenderism because I see huge logical flaws in it. That shouldn't be taken as an argument that you aren't allowed to do it. In a certain way it's like breaking down the rules around psychics. You should be free to stare into a crystal ball or read palms and go on about whatever sense you have about anyone willing to give you five dollars, but it should be regarded as bullshit if that's what it is.

Transgenderism also follows the same pattern as a social contagion, not a medical condition. This would suggest that it's much more a fad that will largely subside, but this remains to be seen.

here is nothing inherently wrong with saying that people who were born women may have had had a different experience in life than people who transitioned.,"There is nothing inherently wrong with saying that people who were born women may have had had a different experience in life than people who transitioned.

So what I mean to say is people jump to conclusion that someone is transphobic whenever someone points out that they have faced different kind of issues because they were born female. 

By no means I'm trying to say that trans-women don't face as many problems in the society but they may not have experienced all the problems that are faced by people who were born female.

What I mean to say is it's okay for people to say that trans-women may not know about all the struggles then people born females have faced and vice versa is also true.",hea9fc,"What's the point of saying that though? People face different experiences and issues in life depending on where they grew up, their socioeconomic status, their physical appearance, their personality, and even just who and what else randomly happened to be around them.

Of course trans women would've had different experiences than cis women - for example, cis women never transitioned - nobody would contest that, I think people refer to saying it as transphobic only when you single out this one difference when it's not necessarily more essential than any other factor affecting people's experiences.",fvq2234
car insurance companies and health insurance companies shouldn't exist.,"In America people pay car insurance, health insurance, etc, but some of these are really just middlemen that don't need to be there. I think we could be saving tons of money on these two insurances if we just payed car manufacturers (or dealerships) and hospitals, respectively. So instead of paying health insurance to a middleman, which requires more money because well its a middleman, you would just pay a local hospital some amount every month and that would be treated as insurance. Hospitals would have to network funds as well.",gav9fd,"The point of car insurance is to insure against damages to a third party. The issue is with the government, not with the dealer

In my state, there are 3 options besides car insurance to do that exact same goal - you can deposit a certain amount of money to the government, use a surety bond to do effectively the same thing, or if you have more than 25 vehicles be self insured. For my state in particular, the first option is 25,000 deposited per vehicle, the second requires the bond to be for 25,000, and self insurance requires for you to own at least 25 vehicles and to file at least 200,000 + 100 per additional vehicle of cash, securities, or surety bonds

So for me, I went with the last option because I have 27 vehicles. 

But still, most people would rather finance their vehicles rather than paying cash, and they are financing a smaller amount than the 25k required for even the cheapest option",fp2hm37
Gender Theory Relies on Sexism or it Falls Apart.,"So, I've mentioned this in other places and have never gotten a satisfactory answer.

In my view, gender theory relies on extremely rigid and outdated gender norms to formulate a 'spectrum' of gender.  

For example, what would be called a tomboy in the 1980s or so would now be considered ""presenting as less female"" than, say, a makeup wearing cheerleader who always wears skirts. But ask a tomboy who isn't in on modern gender theory if wanting to climb trees makes her less of a woman. I dare you.

I'm a USMC combat veteran. I served with ladies who were in the Lioness program, female Marines in potentially combat roles. They cursed, spit, and could kick the shit out of guys like Milo Yiannoupolos. That doesn't make them any more male than him and it doesn't make him female.

The closest thing to an adequate answer is that none of these things matter for gender. There is in fact no metric whatsoever for gender. It's just a state of mind with no real characteristics. Which makes it entirely useless and fictional.

""Feeling feminine"" is sometimes defined as being more nurtering by gender theory people, but that also implies that being nurturing makes you somehow ""less male,"" which I guess means that fathers are less manly than guys that can't handle Parenthood? That can't be right.

I honestly want to have my view changed because I really don't want to start off every discussion on the subject with the nagging feeling that I'm talking to a bigot, but nothing has so much as nudged me in that direction. Being a tomboy doesn't make you less female. Being a good father doesn't make you less male.",gaicru,Imo being a good father is does not make one else of a man. In group of friends and family its generally viewed a good thing and a bad one. I actually celebrate the differences between female and male and dont look down on either one. And I dont care if a man wants to identity as a women or the other way around. I dont belive that gender is a social construct. The reason is the case of David Reimer and many like his that end badly,fp2aa5h
Humans are made to trip; a look at the striking similarities between serotonin and naturally occurring psychedelic substances.,"Edit: In light of some of the responses below, I would like to reframe my statement “humans are made to trip” and extend it to say “life has evolved with a general capacity to trip”.

Naturally occurring entheogens and the numinous altered mind states that they elicit have fascinated human beings for many thousands of years; since perhaps the dawn of our species. 

Psychedelic mushrooms have their hallucinogenic properties thanks to the naturally occurring chemicals produced by and found within them; namely, the prodrug Psilocybin. Psilocybin is metabolised by the human body upon consumption and becomes the psychoactive tryptamine alkaloid Psilocin - Psilocin is also known as 4-Hydroxy Dimethyltryptamine. 


Psilocybin’s molecular composition very closely resembles that of Serotonin - Serotonin is also known as 5-Hydroxytryptamine. Serotonin is a monoamine neurotransmitter - neurotransmitters are messenger chemicals released between the gaps of synapses in the brain, known as synaptic clefts, in order to carry impulses or messages. Other examples of neurotransmitters are dopamine, adrenaline or endorphins; these molecules actively modulate our awareness all the time. Serotonin is involved in regulating mood, recalling memory, sleep, digestion, and learning among other subtler functions; it is a multifaceted compound that plays a complex role in neurochemistry. 


DMT - also known as N,N-Dimetholtryptamine - is a chemical substance that occurs in many plants and animals and which is both a derivative and a structural analog of other tryptamines. It is also the most powerful psychedelic drug known to science. 

DMT has been prepared by various cultures around the globe for ritual purposes as an entheogen for millennia, usually in the form of a brew or beverage made from a combination of plants. These plants are pressed, churned and brewed in an ancient shamanic technique whose discovery lies far in our prehistory. In order to unlock the hallucinogenic properties from these concoctions a specific selection of plants must be used; a plant - typically a grass - with a high concentration of DMT and also a plant that contains an Monoamine oxidase inhibitor - or MAO inhibitor.


Psilocin - the psychoactive component of psychedelic mushrooms - also closely resembles DMT’s molecular structure except that it includes its own MAO inhibitor built into the compound.
When ingested in conjunction with DMT, the MAO inhibitor prevents enzymes in the gut from degrading the DMT allowing it to become orally active where it would otherwise be metabolised almost immediately; this makes the psychedelic experience last much longer, roughly 6 hours. This means that on the molecular level psilocin is effectively a prepackaged orally active DMT. 


Psilocin and DMT are both known to be competitive at the bond site of serotonergic chemical pathways in the body, causing a process known in biochemistry as competitive inhibition. Competitive inhibition occurs when molecules very similar to the substrate molecules bind to the active site and prevent binding of the actual substrate, meaning they actually fit the receptors on the synapses better than Serotonin and, as a result, will effectively replace it’s role for a period of time. 

Our bodies seem to know exactly how to handle these powerful psychedelic compounds.
This should be no surprise however, traces of DMT are present in many organic foods and it is, after all, endogenously produced by our brains; it is a typical part of neurochemistry.

This is demonstrated when DMT is smoked or injected without a MAO inhibitor. DMT is remarkably fast acting, with the experience coming on within around 30 seconds and usually lasting anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes, DMT is fully metabolised by the body within an hour. The rapid response by the body to DMT is a hallmark of an unobtrusive substance. The fact that these compounds are so non-invasive towards the brain, in spite of the intense nature of the ‘trip’,  perhaps suggests humans are hardwired for these experiences.",nppgx4,"Animals generally have a lot of similarities, and given that psychoactive compounds generally seem to preexist humans, a better model of understanding their role probably goes more like this.

1) Organisms develop chemicals that aid in discouraging predation.

2) Humans are similar enough to other organisms that the chemicals lock into our system as well, but sometimes both because we're a different size than the predators that originally co-evolved alongside these chemical responses, and because we have the ability to control dose and particulars of ingestion, we sometimes get an enjoyable effect where others get an unpleasant enough reaction to discourage eating the thing. You can see a similar effect in hot peppers or coffee beans.

3) Based on this model, scientists generally think psilocybin likely evolved to deter insects, like many other chemicals.",h06dbpn
Most religious people in developed countries are simply not interested (or perhaps not interested enough) in the truth.,"I became an atheist when I was around 13 after previously believing in God but not actively participating in any religion. My family comprises of a mixture of religious people and atheists so I realise I come from a privileged position in that I was not disowned or shunned by my family for being atheist but rather was met with indifference. 

And I also acknowledge that many religious people are secret atheists and just aren't ""out"" yet but I dont class these people as religious. In the term ""religous"" I encompass anyone who believes (and truly belives) in a religious deity. In fact, I could probably encompass all spiritual people in my point. Basically, those who believe in spirituality and/or a deity are not interested or not interested enough (in the sense they care more about something else) in the truth. 

There are a many arguments for the existence of God, such as the ontological argument, the blind watch maker, personal experiences/emotions etc. But there are only a finite number. Every single argument for the existence of God has been debunked time and time again so while some of these arguments sound convincing, upon further research or further thought you realise they aren't. 

And for most people who believe in a deity, their belief system is philosophically inconsistent. They use one philosophy in terms of how to determine truth in the case of God but use a different one in other scenarios. It's the definition of doublethink. 

This leads me to ask, why do so many people in the modern age and in developed countries still believe in God? And the answer is as stated in the title. They aren't that bothered about the truth. 

If they cared about the truth, they would research atheism and understand the arguments for an against it. They would realise the inconsistencies in their own philosophy and either get rid of the notion of absolute truth or get rid of God.

Even in a debate, you see that Christian's most of the time only care about feeling that they have won rather than converting the other party. When it becomes apparent that every one of their arguments are flawed, they resort to defensive strategies that are equally illogical. Either that or they simply dont listen to the other side and just restate their arguments again and again. These people are by no means stupid, so why do they behave like this in a debate? Because they aren't interested in the truth. They just want to continue believing what they do and feel like they've won the debate even if they clearly haven't. 

And most religious people are the same. They just want to continue to believe what they believe because it's better than the alternative. In some cases the alternative is accepting that human beings are not that important in the universe, in some cases the alternative is being shunned by their family, being extradited from their culture and losing their identity. I realise all these cases aren't the same but they're all examples of where a theist cares more about something else than they do about the truth. In a sense, they do not care enough about the truth. 

I think there are a few main ways that you could change my mind: 
1) Come up with another reason someone might remain a theist that is more widespread than the reasoning above. 
2) Convince me that there are some arguments for the existence of God that haven't yet been debunked convincingly or that the debunking of one of the arguments itself isn't convincing. 
3) Explain how believing in God can be philosophically consistent and how it is philosophically consistent for the majority of theists. 


I would actually like my view to be changed because I dont enjoy being cynical about religious people. I would like to gain a fuller understanding of why people believe what they do (whatever that may be).",ehli2s,We can't prove that God is right so you just you cant say that believing in god isn't the truth,fckvcpv
Society would be better off without gender norms,"I think there is no need for the existence of gender norms. Certain norms (at least in the United States and I expect in much of the rest of the world) like the idea that girls must play with certain toys, boys must play with other toys, like certain colors, hobbies, etc. are entirely useless. There is no need to place these norms on children or adults and I think it actually does more harm than good. People will feel like they don't fit in their ""norm"" and might think negatively about themselves because of it or choose not to pursue hobbies of interest.

Other norms that exist primarily later in life like the idea that the man must be the provider or leader of the family is also a silly one.

There is a zero percent chance 20 Republican Senators will be convinced to convict President Trump during an Impeachment Trial,"I’ll give a brief ode to our self-evident hyper-polarization simply because there’s a minimum word count to these posts. 

Because the Republican base gets its news from Fox and increasingly OAN and Breitbart, and view anything else as Liberal propaganda, red state Senators have no motivation to remove Trump from office, no matter how internally disgusted they may be, because they will open themselves up to a backlash from their base, especially the most rabid members who are also primary voters. A few in unique situations (Mitt Romney) or purple states (Cory Gardner) may even feel comfortable voicing support for a vote to convict, but even they will probably not vote Yes unless they are assured there are 66 other Yes votes. Why open yourself to ads from a potential primary opponent from the Right if he won’t be convicted either way? 

And THAT’s if McConnell even allows a vote to be taken. He may very well pull a Merrick Garland maneuver and table Impeachment proceedings in the first five minutes after the House votes to Impeach. 

No, the only way Trump will be removed from office prior to January 2021 is if he does something far beyond the Ukraine call; something so obscenely heinous that the Senate would have political cover to vote unanimously in favor of removal. He’s going to have to do something akin to shooting someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue.

A test/exam for something you've been taught shouldn't require extra preparation,"For example, you shouldn't be expected to practice to a course's ""final exam"" by solving previous exams - The test should assess the level of knowledge and understanding you've gained by completing the course's tasks and by paying attention during class (or learning properly from the textbook).

"Now that Warren has released a plan to pay for M4A, and committed to not raising taxes on the middle class (no matter what); I plan to vote for her if she's the nominee","I have previously posted here that I wouldn't vote for Warren about of concerns that she'd have to massively hike taxes on the middle class in order to pay for M4A. Her plan, plus her rhethoric, have convinced me that won't be the case.

Obviously my mind is open on this one. My views:

\- I believe Warren would wash down or not implement M4A at all if the only way to do it were tax increases on the middle class

\- I don't believe that the tax changes will stifle innovation, or be so high that business would move to other countries

\- M4A won't help me personally, the medical benefits from my workplace are better than M4A will ever be. I don't see this changing with M4A in a way that would be negative for me. It might be that my basic coverage would be M4A, and all the other stuff like therapy/chiropractic/vision/etc... would be under my work still. That would be fine.

\- Ultimately I don't want tax increases on the middle class because that would directly reduce spending power, and would thus negatively impact our economy. Given the amount of median debt the middle class has, even a change of $100 a week could make people ""buckle down"" more

To change my view, you'd need to convince me that it'd be better to vote for Trump over Warren (this view assumes the election would be Warren vs Trump).",dvew74,"Warren's plan is more of a hypothetical than a policy she intends to implement.

And those are just the biggest ticket items. 

The simpler way to do it would be to just raise middle class taxes, and if she wants to pass a plan in four years I expect that's where much of the funding will end up coming from.",f7cvaxz
biting into a chocolate bar is the best way to eat it,"This could pertain to KitKat bars, Hershey Bars, basically any chocolate bars that you buy and are sectioned off into little squares. I realize that the squares are there to break the chocolate apart, but if the bar is just for you, why not bite? Here are a few reasons:

• it’s more convenient (easier when driving, etc.)

• it’s the sanitary option (no hands touching your food)

• we eat other “packaged bars” (such as granola bars) like this, so why not treat chocolate bars the same?

I’ve had many friends tell me that I eat these bars wrong, so I’m excited to see some responses! Here’s to a curious and lighthearted discussion about eating chocolate bars. :]",gpjfed,"There are some chocolates that could be broken inside the wrapper, so I do that when I can. It prevents my hands from touching the parts I'm not eating. 

For bars the size of Hershey Bars, I usually can't finish the entire bar so I have to break off a piece.

As for convenience, one shouldn't eat chocolate while driving since it's not exactly the safest way to go about the road.

In terms of flavor, breaking off a bite-sized piece is a much better experience, since the perfect amount of chocolate melts inside the mouth, and one savors it. Biting a piece off the whole bar encourages more biting and less melting. The chocolate will stick to your teeth and you'll get none of the richness.

"While it's not technically too late to mitigate climate change, the conditions required to do so are not going to happen in the time we have left.

*The collective will to do something about climate change at the expense of our short-term interests isn't there.

**35% would pay higher taxes

**[32% would pay $10 a month more in energy bills](https://apnorc.org/projects/what-americans-think-about-the-economy/)

**And this is discounting the fact that saying you'll do something is easier than actually doing it, and the [non-response bias](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/could-social-alienation-among-some-trump-supporters-help-explain-why-polls-underestimated-trump-again/) present in polls since 2016 means that it's likely lower. 

Climate denial isn't the problem anymore. [75% of Americans believe anthropogenic climate change is real](https://www.newsweek.com/10-percent-americans-dont-believe-climate-change-15-percent-unsure-poll-1642747), we just don't want to fight it if it means giving up our comfortable, coal and gas-fueled lifestyles. And the worse climate change gets, the harder it'll be to convince people to give up the few luxuries they have left.

\*\*Leftists take this as proof that collective and not individual action is needed, but the ""[100 companies](https://np.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/bk0uw0/71_of_greenhouse_gases_made_by_100_companies_but/emd7rdv/)"" responsible for the majority of emissions are mostly fossil fuel companies, and if people don't want to pay more for products to fight climate change, why would they support regulations that would result in higher electrical bills, more expensive gasoline and increased prices for products across the board? The terrifying thing about our lack of political action on climate change isn't that politicians are ignoring the will of the people, it's that the status quo *is* the will of the people. Look what happened to Joe Biden's approval rating when groceries and gas became more expensive, and [what happened in France](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/04/europe/france-yellow-vest-protests-intl/index.html) after the government tried taxing fuel.

\*The party that's opposed to fighting climate change has a disproportionate amount of power, which will get worse as the urban-rural political divide increases. The seeds are being sown among the populist right that elites are using climate change as a pretext to gain control or hoard resources at the expense of the average person. To them, the deprivation of goods and services caused by COVID are something that liberals want to force on them permanently, under the name of the ""Great Reset"", and honestly, they won't even be wrong. Give it a couple of years and Tucker Carlson will be telling his audience that the left is coming to take your lawn, your truck, and your steak. ""We will not eat the bugs"" will become mainstream political discourse. 

\*The party that nominally supports fighting climate change won't make any serious effort to actually do so. And it's not because they're beholden to corporate donors, it's because [we, the voters, don't want them to](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-climatechange/americans-demand-climate-action-reuters-poll-idUSKCN1TR15W).

\*Our only hope is to make it so that taking steps to cut our CO2 emissions happens to coincide with our short-term interests. However:

*Solar and wind can't replace fossil fuels. The low price of solar is a mirage; getting to 100% renewable energy means coming up with solutions to store or generate energy when solar/wind aren't available. [Despite the attempts of the federal government](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/climate/renewable-energy-batteries.html), none of the solutions we currently have are cheaper than burning fossil fuels and it would take an unlikely miracle for that to change in the little time we have left.

*Voters are too scared of nuclear energy to ever support it, something that hasn't changed in 35 years. Fusion is a meme.

*There are 1.3 billion gas vehicles on the road. Even if the perfect electric vehicle was released tomorrow, most of those vehicles would still be used for years to come. [The average light-duty vehicle in the US is 12 years old.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/10/climate/electric-vehicle-fleet-turnover.html)

*Carbon capture is unprofitable and cannot scale to the levels required to make a serious dent in CO2 levels, partially because sequestering carbon itself requires a source of energy. The only way it can become profitable is through a carbon tax, a measure so politically unpopular that [it can't pass even in a blue state like Wahsington](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/07/obituary-carbon-tax-beloved-climate-policy-dies-47/619507/). You can't redistribute the costs unless companies simply absorb the tax rather than cut emissions, which defeats the purpose. And even if you could, there's no way that a monthly rebate check is going to emotionally balance the sticker shock that voters will face every day. Hillary Clinton's campaign manager referred to carbon taxes as ""lethal in the general"".

*Geoengineering won't save us, because these projects won't be considered until people in developed countries directly feel the effects of climate change. But that point will be a lagging indicator to how much damage climate change has caused. By the time we notice something more severe than a mild price increase for household goods, it'll be too late for our biosphere and billions of people in developing countries.

\*[China is going all in on coal](https://e360.yale.edu/features/despite-pledges-to-cut-emissions-china-goes-on-a-coal-spree).

All of these things aren't *technically* impossible to overcome. But I would bet my life savings that they won't.

"Hyper-conservative ideals, people, and politicians serve no use to society but to hold us back.","It's a very simple view really.

I do recognize that saying ""no use"" is a bit drastic, but I don't think it's far from the truth. The useful ideas that conservative politics typically put forward are just as easily put forward by opposition. If we're to compare conservative vs progressive, conservative is to stay where we are, whereas progressive is to build upon what we have to progress forwards. 

That's not to say it's all bad, there is a reason I said hyper-conservative, because at the end of the day the majority of conservative people I know are progressive thinking, but conservative in action, which I believe still can be useful to society.

It goes to show that even after donating absurd amounts of money he can’t even slow his net worth gains (+16B in 2019 alone) much less give most or all of it away, just how out of hand wealth inequality has become across the globe. Change my view?",h0123y,"It's not a bad thing that Bill &amp; Melinda Gates' net worth is growing.

Care workers who are paid for ‘sleep-in’ shifts should not get minimum wage.,"So in the UK there is a case about to go to the Supreme Court following challenges that care workers who do ‘sleep-in’ shifts should get minimum wage. The high court said they should get minimum wage, the court of appeal overturned it so now it’s going to the Supreme Court.
In case anyone doesn’t know, a sleep-in shift is usually for care workers who look after people with care needs that are not usually overly complex. These people are usually relatively independent with personal needs so the care worker is permitted to sleep at work but they have to be available to help or assist the service users if needed. The care workers are often paid a flat rate for the sleep in (one place I know pays £40 for the night) with some places also offering the daytime hourly rate if you are needed at any point during the night.
So the reasons I think this shouldn’t happen are 
1) most people at work are not permitted to sleep on the job. It wouldn’t be fair for you to earn minimum wage for sleeping whilst a day time counterpart may also earn minimum wage but not permitted to sleep on the job. If you earned minimum wage on sleep-ins, you could in theory, opt to only do sleep-ins and thus take home a full wage packet without actually doing any work. 
2) why would a company pay you minimum wage to sleep? If they have to start paying minimum wage then the company are probably going to try and find other tasks for you to do thus turning your sleep-in to a proper night shift. Some people like the sleep-ins because it tops up their wages in what is normally a shift work job without actually having to do much work. 
3) I work a job where I do on-call from home and I get paid £20 per 12 hour standby rate then time and half when I get called in to work. Like the people doing the sleep-ins, I can’t just go and do what I want, I can’t drink alcohol or travel far away. So to do so would set a precedent across all industry that could cost millions which could lead back to the concern in point 2 where they just decide to use you for proper work instead of as a standby which some (if not most) people wouldn’t want.
4) the example provided on the BBC article I read (assuming I interpret this correctly) it says that over a 16 month period, one worker was called on just 6 times at night. So for the majority, this worker got a full nights sleep. If you regularly spend a large part of your sleep-in dealing with your service users then maybe it should be a night shift instead of a sleep in anyway. But I feel that the whole system should allow you to claim a better rate for the time you deal with your service users overnight but overall, they should be allowed to maintain a flat rate sleep-in.",f2gvws,"I’m a firefighter/paramedic and work 24-hour shifts (48-hour shifts when I work doubles) and therefore sleep at work. I have a bed there and everything. I am paid for the whole 24-hour period.

I usually use one of two different examples to explain why we’re paid for the whole time we’re working.

If someone works in a call-center they’re not paid strictly for being on the phone. They’re still being paid between phone calls. They’re paid for the whole eight-hour shift. The same is true for us. The only difference is that both our shifts, and the breaks between responsibilities are longer.

I also compare us to a seatbelt. You don’t put on your seatbelt only when you’re having an accident. You wear your seatbelt all the time in case something goes wrong. You don’t get upset at your seatbelt because you haven’t gotten in an accident. Even when you’re not in a car accident it’s doing it’s job: being there in case something goes wrong. Likewise my job is not only responding to emergencies, but also being available waiting to be needed.

Hopefully that helps.",fhcjuhx
Expats in a foreign country are not morally obliged to follow the foreign culture unquestioningly,"My experience is about living in Japan as a person who values reason and the importance of questioning social norms. But hopefully, this can be generalized to any person immersed in any foreign culture.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that we as individuals should not give up on idealistic goals and stop questioning social norms just because it's easy or that's how the real world works and this is happening a lot these days.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, isn't it hypocritical that we criticize Muslim values to be regressive and anti-feministic, but when it comes to Japan, we say it is just a cultural difference.

&amp;#x200B;

My point is that we should be able to criticize and reason about any culture openly without bias and if we find it to be wrong, we should be able to have an open argument about it, even though it may be uncomfortable. Saying that ""it is just a cultural difference."" is detrimental to society.",decd15,"Your whole idea that people should morally be able to have an open argument about values, whether or not people are made uncomfortable, is in itself a prime example of a huge difference in cultural values between Japan and America. Being American myself, and having lived in Tokyo for over 6 years, I would say most of my Japanese coworkers and friends avoid conflict and that awkward uncomfortable feeling that stems from a differing of core values. 

Of course if you morally object personally to a Japanese cultural practice, by all means do not participate. I never once ate whale meat and also never took part in eating fish while they were still alive, even though I was offered multiple times to take part. You are under no moral obligation to follow any cultural practice unquestioningly. Just like an American vegan or vegetarian wouldn’t be under any moral obligation to enjoy a Texan barbecue meal. 

But just like most people who eat meat feel attacked when a vegan lectures them on their own cultural beliefs about eating meat, a Japanese person would similarly feel attacked when being enlightened about their work life balance by an outsider. 

You do not have a moral obligation to follow every single Japanese cultural practice. You do have a moral obligation to not be an asshole about it and be the moral crusader for the benefit of Japanese society. You’re not going to change Japanese culture arguing with Japanese people. You’ll just be that annoying self-righteous foreigner who thinks his way is the right way and makes people uncomfortable.",f2wu6fk
"""[bad economic system instituted by Capitalists] is not real Capitalism"" and ""[bad economic system instituted by Socialists] is not real Socialism"" are No True Scotsman Arguments","I often see Capitalists and Socialists try to fight off criticism of their economic systems by claiming that flawed Capitalist/Socialist economic systems were not really Capitalist/Socialist because of flaws in their economic system.  

This argument is not true because Capitalism and Socialism are broad economic systems that allow for corruption and atrocities.  Supporting private ownership of the economy does not require someone to be against slavery (CSA) similar to how support for public ownership does not require one to be against a brutal and totalitarian government (Soviet Union). 

Private or public ownership of the economy doesn't prevent governments from implementing horrible policies or taking actions that seem to go against their economic system such as privatizing or nationalizing the economy.  

All economic systems have flaws and their proponents need to recognize that they do have problems that must be addressed rather than pretending that private or public control of the economy will naturally create a utopian society.",o0qil9,"In general, you are right. But a lot of the arguments that are specifically leveled against capitalism are not exclusive to capitalism, nor do they appear equally among capitalist societies. So to say because one capitalist system had this bad feature it doesn't necessarily mean that that is a feature of capitalist societies, because of the wide degree of variation amongst those societies. That same logic is theoretically applicable to communist societies, but in practicality, communist societies tend to converge on the same authoritarian dictatorship and Central planning of the economy system because that's the only thing that's stable under their philosophy. So in a bunch of different countries with very different backgrounds and cultures implement a communist plan and they all converge towards the same institutions and form, then it's a little more appropriate to criticize those institutions and forms as a result of communism.",h215nff
Not recasting Black Panther is wrong,"(Boseman's) portrayal of T'Challa the Black Panther will forever be etch into our minds as one of the best characters in MCU. Disney not recasting the character out of respect for Boseman is a mistake in my view. Not recasting T'Challa is a disservice to black male actors, black people around the world and MCU fans. Boseman was such an amazing actor, and person, I don't think he would have wanted this. There are so few black main stream MCU heros, they need to keep this character going in the present to keep the juice, they hype, the excitement going. I know they want to try and focus on the other characters of Wakanda but that is something they can do with another movie or TV series, which I think would be awesome. I have always compared Black Panther and Batman. They're both extremely intelligent,  have physical training, detective skills and combat skills beyond anyone else. I know people like to compare Batman and Ironman but it's really just the money and intelligence people see. Would you want to see a Batman movie with no Batman? People would be pissed. Sure there are TV shows that have Batman characters but we're all secretly hoping to see a glimpse of Batman when we watch. Chadwick Boseman will always be Black Panther to so many people just like Adam West will always be Batman to some people. So, give another shot to another actor to play King T'Challa. Thanks!",l2sx46,"You can keep the franchise alive and still not recast T'Chala.

One of the rumors I've heard is that they might use the next Dr. Strange movie, _Multiverse of Madness_ to pull in the Black Panther replacement from another universe - potentially one where Killmonger was never evil and assumed the mantel of BP while T'Chala ruled as king.  If they do that, they can keep the BP franchise alive, with a strong black lead in line with the mythology, and not replace Boseman as T'Chala.",gk7m81r
"The idea of ""The Death of the Author"" is entirely legitimate","Here's a quick definition of this from TVTropes: ""Death of the Author is a concept from mid-20th Century literary criticism; it holds that an author's intentions and biographical facts (the author's politics, religion, etc) should hold no special weight in determining an interpretation of their writing. This is usually understood as meaning that a writer's views about their own work are no more or less valid than the interpretations of any given reader.""

To me, what makes art special is that there is no right answer, that two people can experience a movie or a book and walk away with completely different interpretations of the themes, events and characters. If I can back up my interpretation of a piece of art with direct evidence from the art than why is my interpretation any less valid?

I'll give an example, this is actually what inspired me to make this post, and I think it's a little funny. So I was in Panera Bread and there was this picture up on the wall, it was for and by Panera Bread - it had the logo in it which I'll touch on in a second - but it was not a typical advertisement, it was just a picture really. I've tried to find the picture online but I can't find it, so here's my description:

There were two women, one on the left and one on the right - you're looking at them from the side, at their profiles. They're both looking down on a table between them as they're making cookies. They're wearing aprons and their sleeves are pulled up, and they're both putting icing on the cookies. The woman on the left looks about 60, give or take a few years. The woman on the right looks 35-40. They both have darker features, I thought they looked related like mother and daughter but my girlfriend disagreed so take that as you will. The colors of the painting were not saturated, they were pretty pale. Most of all, the women looked quite solemn, not even that they were focused on making the cookies, they just looked tired more than anything else. Finally, on the collar of the woman on right, is the Panera Bread logo sticking out.

To me, this picture can be interpreted as a critique of capitalism and its effects. How poorer people can be stuck in low-paying dead end jobs which gets moved on to their children, as they did not have the same opportunities as your average person for education, for example. I couldn't help but contrast the looks on their faces and the overall paleness of the picture with how bright and colorful the cookies were, like how behind what capitalism produces, there's something working their ass off and suffering - there's darkness behind the color. And then the Panera Bread logo just seemed the like the final punch to the gut, that this process is being orchestrated by this corporation being lead by people who are being paid more money than either of these workers could ever dream of receiving.

I said it was funny, because obviously that was not the intention. Panera Bread just wanted an artsy looking picture to hang in their stores because it helps with the atmosphere. And my own thoughts and beliefs simply informed an over analysis of this innocuous picture. But I still don't think I'm wrong, photography is an art form and I gave reasons for my interpretation. Whether or not they're good is up to you but they are reasons.

Additionally, I don't even consider ""The Death of the Author"" to *really* be the death of the author simply because the author or the artist or the director or whatever has all the power in the making of their art. If an artist has an interpretation of their work as their making it, they have all the power to add evidence which makes their interpretation legitimate.

I have an example of this too, (I promise this is shorter) in the show Bojack Horseman, there's a character named Todd that was revealed to be asexual at the end of the third season and the beginning of the fourth season. The show's creator and showrunner Raphael Bob-Waksberg has said that he interpreted Todd to be asexual before this point, from the first 2 seasons or so, he interpreted something deeper of a character he created that, at that point, had no evidence whatsoever in the show. He followed his interpretation and used his power as the author to make Todd asexual. Todd isn't asexual because Raphael said so, he's asexual because of all of the evidence from the show, from all the stories and lines of dialogue related to Todd's love life throughout the entire series.

That is the true power of the author, that they can create their own evidence for their interpretation of their work. And even still, people can have differing interpretations because there are so many factors to account for regardless of the artform that an author couldn't possibly make every detail definitively prove their interpretation.",kqa5un,"I geberaly agree with you and the concept of ""death of the author"", but by consuming and maybe even paying for the artwork, you still support the author(be it with direct money or by making the artist more famous).

So while the authors worldview is not relevant for the interpretation of the work, it is important as a consumer.",gi2n26u
" To me, it stands to reason that raising the minimum wage should negatively impact jobs and, in turn, the economy.","I mean, it makes sense to me. Employers have to pay more money so they have to cut costs. Especially smaller businesses that may just out right be forced out of business.

I get the idea that eventually the money would work it's way around but if a bunch of jobs are cut first then how are people suppose to get the money that then gets recycled?

However, pretty much any studies are to the contrary. That job growth and overall income seems to range from unaffected to better.

But how can this be? Businesses aren't just going to eat that cost. If they raise their prices for everything instead then what's even the point since people won't be able to afford things again?

Nothing about this adds up. Everything about raising minimum wage seems to be purely positive but I just can't reason how or why. It still only makes logical sense to me that raising the minimum wage should largely be negative.",esisay,"price of articles on the market are set by what people are willing to pay.

"People like LeBron and other celebrities really should ""shut up an dribble"" or whatever other thing they do","Not even specifically LeBron, but if you're an athlete, or an actress, or a musician etc. That is your craft, not politics, not religion, or policing, or economics. You aren't an expert in those things and you shouldn't have this national stage that allows people to listen to your ideas on things you don't know any more than an average joe about. 

If we are including the voices of so many basketball players in how we should police our communities, we're giving the public ideas coming from people that have never been an officer or worked/studied any part of law and order in their life. Their opinions are pretty fuckin far off from the truth but they're being spread more than any experts out there. I'm not saying they can't have an opinion, but their opinions shouldn't be held any hire than your friend Sarah from work. If we want to change those things, we should be hearing from judges, officers, lawyers along with social workers, politicians and other people who deal with these things more closely. Their voices get drowned out by people with no real information just observations and opinions because they're famous. 

I believe whole heartedly this has to do with a social psychology phenomenon (I can't remember the name of it) in which people attribute general intelligence onto somebody they respect, so therefore value their opinions highly on things they have no expertise in. I'm sure it also has to do with them agreeing with your side of the aisle as well, but for some reason people think these celebrities have valid opinions on politics despite knowing nothing about it. This leads to people believing things that probably aren't even close to the truth, and furthers the spread of bad information. If we want to keep the public informed about things, we need people to not comment on things publicly if they don't have an opinion that comes from experience.

"If a hobby consists of just buying/collecting overpriced 'exclusive' items from a massive corporation, it's not a hobby, it's being a victim of marketing.","I like to buy a couple of sneakers each year that I use until they fall apart. I'm sure most people enjoy having a fresh pair of clean new sneakers - but I can't understand sneakerheads or any other type of hobby that exclusively consists of buying overpriced items from a company's product line-up, playing into the hands of their marketing department.

I understand collection hobbies that consist of collecting cheaper (maybe irrelevant) stuff that as a whole mean something (stamps, coins, etc) or piece together a part of our history, or of course books, paintings (not the tax dodging fine art kind) and collecting any other unique products in a category that may be made by different people, companies, artisans, artists, etc. 

This may also be an age thing where lots of teenagers obsess over a certain thing, and there are lots of predatory adults in the middle that know they can make good money by reselling said items to obsessive teenagers? Otherwise I can't really see the market forces behind it.

I could say a similar situation applies to action figure collectors (equally baffle me) but at least there is a story behind it, the Marvel/DC universe (never interested me, don't know much about) - even though it's still just a plastic toy in a never-to-be-opened plastic display case.

I assume most people that become sneakerheads have to wear them normally out and about in busy dirty urban environments, thereby relinquishing most of its resale value - unless again they buy just for photos and resale opportunities down the line? So it's a collection for the sake of just having a wide selection to choose from and wear, the more they have, the less each one wears out and always look ""new"" therefore sustaining this buying model - but in their minds it's still a sunken cost, right?

When thinking of shoes and this obsessive nature some teenagers have, it's by nature a weirder item to collect because if they start too young then most ot the shoes don't fit later on.",va7e3r,It doesn't matter whether or not you're a victim of marketing. That doesn't make it not a hobby.,ic0s91c
Citizens of western countries who left to join ISIS shouldn't lose their citizenship. They should be taken home and charged with treason.,"This is a topic I don't know too much about, so it shouldn't be hard to change my view.

As far as I'm aware, losing citizenship is not a valid sentence in the law. If it was, it would require due process to carry out. Simply abandoning our citizens abroad, while deserved, seems irresponsible and a failure of the duty of a country to its citizens.

Even the worst murders, rapists, even terrorists do not lose their citizenship as a result of their crimes when they're committed within the country.

"Even if it's hurting Russia, Putin won't end the war in Ukraine unless he sees some kind of ""out"" for himself personally -- a way of withdrawing that would allow him to save face; and the best way for Ukraine to give him this out would be to play along with his ""denazification"" charade","When I say ""play along,"" here's what I mean: Let's say the war starts going *really* badly for Russia -- even more so than it already is -- and Putin reaches a point where he feels like has no choice but to end it somehow. In order to give him that opportunity, Ukraine could (for instance) make a big show of declaring that henceforth, no member of any Nazi-aligned party would be allowed to hold any position of public office in Ukraine; it could disband the Azov Battalion; it could take steps to stem the tide of whatever neo-Nazi movements [actually have become a genuine problem in the country](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/ukraine-has-nazi-problem-vladimir-putin-s-denazification-claim-war-ncna1290946); and so on. Ultimately, these steps wouldn't require the Ukrainian government to do *that* much more than reiterate the laws already on the books forbidding things like sedition, actively plotting to commit physical violence against minority groups, and so on. But the fact that the Ukrainian government would be making this new proclamation and taking these new steps in such a dramatic and public way could theoretically allow Putin to declare victory (or at least provide a partial justification for doing so) and bring his troops back home with a bunch of triumphant speeches about how they've liberated Ukraine from the yoke of tyranny and paved the way for a future peaceful reunification of the two countries. (Naturally, such a reunification would never happen, but he'd be able to pretend otherwise, and could claim that this ""first step"" of denazifying Ukraine was the thing he was trying to accomplish all along, with subsequent phases of his plan to be carried out later.)

Now, needless to say, any peaceful resolution to the current war would also have to include territorial considerations regarding Crimea and Donbas and so on. I have no idea what the best way to resolve these disputes would be; maybe they could be addressed by, say, allowing those territories to hold a vote on independence in 2024 or something like that. Ukraine might have an incentive to agree to this because it would give them a theoretical chance of actually being able to keep those territories; and Putin might likewise have an incentive to agree because he'd be able to use it to add credibility to his narrative of liberation -- not to mention being able to assure his base that the election would surely go Russia's way (since, after all, he'd be doing everything he could to corrupt the process). It wouldn't be a clean election by any means; but even so, it'd still be better than the current bloodshed. And besides, in terms of the whole ""letting Putin save face"" thing, the fact that the election wouldn't take place until 2024 would mean that even if those territories voted to remain Ukrainian, it wouldn't be such a blow to Putin's image because the news cycle would have moved on by then; the Western media, in particular, would be obsessing so much over the 2024 presidential race that they might hardly even take notice.

Either way, it seems clear to me that the main thing to figure out here is just what exactly Ukraine and its allies would be able to offer Putin that he'd actually be able to use as a pretext for withdrawing in a way that he could still spin as a win. The way I see it, the possibility allowing him to save face in this way -- bringing his troops back to Russia as (ostensibly) triumphant liberators, having ousted the Nazi presence from Ukraine and set the stage for its eastern territories to democratically declare their freedom and ally with Russia -- is the only thing that could realistically make Putin ever even consider withdrawing.

If you want to change my view, you can convince me that either [A] there's *no* realistic way at all that Russia will ever voluntarily withdraw from Ukraine at this point, and the only way this thing will end is with total victory for one side or another (depressing, but certainly a very strong possibility), or [B] there's some other, better way out of this situation that I haven't considered yet. Obviously, Option B would be the preferable one! But I'm open to all views. So let's hear them!",tosga1,"The problem with this proposal is that it is offering things of zero value to Putin, and therefore unlikely to be meaningful negotiating factors.

""Denazification"" is not a real goal, but a pretext for overthrowing the govt led by Zelenskyy.  Giving other things towards a putative ""denazification"" doesn't actually do anything for Putin, and I don't think it helps his internal political situation because nobody inside Russia really gives a fuck about it either.

The actual negotiation is about the Donbass and Crimean lands and which side of the border they end up on.  That's an actual thing Putin wants and that can plausibly be called some sort of victory.  They will not be handled with a referendum as neither side trusts the other to conduct one.  Russia already did a sham referendum in Crimea after the 2014 invasion to ratify their annexation.  Their status would need to be hammered out at the negotiating table, or decided by facts on the ground of the war.",i2787en
There isn't a humane/sensible reason anymore to fight against the implementation of a universal healthcare system.,"Specifically speaking for the United States. 

If you're opposed to implementing some form of universal healthcare, I am curious as to what the rationale is. 

It's very odd that the most wealthy country on the planet has convinced itself and many of it's citizens that a better healthcare system is just completely out of the cards. 

We as citizens chip in for the benefit of others and ourselves in so many things (from 'trivial' to essential) that it's mind boggling, yet healthcare, one of the most important pieces of life period, is the one thing that has to remain siloed and fucked beyond imagination? 

Let me elaborate a bit more lol. Streets. Police. Public school. Water. Waste management. Electrical grids. Science research. Agriculture research. Highways. Colleges. General landscaping. I won't keep going because the list is far too long and I guarantee someone would bring up a technicality on something I said but the point I'm making is we all pay into systems that benefit us all. When I drive on the street, I have an expectation that the street is safe and it typically always is because me and my thousands of neighbors pay to have the streets maintained and built. It's fantastic. I never once have felt like ""I pay more in taxes than xyz person, so they shouldn't be able to use the same roads or government scientific research studies/grants that MY dollars goes to"" ...that's just...weird and entitled as hell IMO lol 

Switch over the healthcare. Our. Healthcare. System. Is. Insanely. Bad. The argument that we ""can't do universal healthcare because it's too complicated"" is so weak. Complexity is not a reason to not to something... The argument that someone else is paying less than you are for the same health treatment/options is self-centered, entitled, and borderline brainwashing from the powers that be (see my argument above). 

How can you be against a universal system, knowing how our current system is, and not see how that's just inhumane at this point? The level individuality combined with the convoluted nature of healthcare in the US at this point is bordering demented. People die, go bankrupt, forego treatment, forego doctor's visits, and many more things due to not having a reliable, cost effective, and accessible system to just stay alive/get treated/live a normal life. 

Lastly, ""just get a job, and get good insurance"" is the worst. This puts the ability to get healthcare in direct correlation to your career value (as most higher paying careers are the ones with better/any employer provided insurance options). 

Bottom line, the conversation should not be whether we migrate to a universal system or not. The conversation should be, in what way(s) are we going to implement the universal system.

Edit: Adding this point, the system for payments is even asinine. There is virtually no rhyme or reason (at least to the consumer) to what you'd be charged and how. You may be able to get your knee checked out and pay a $0 co-pay, oorrrrr it may result in a $795.43 bill. Guess you'll just have to come on in and find out lol.",hr2hpi,"US healthcare is “insanely bad”? That is some serious rhetoric there.

It isn’t perfect but it isn’t insanely bad.

And let’s talk humane/sensible. Where are you on the advancement of medical science? A lot of testing can be done on animals, but to find treatments and cures we need to learn about health problems.

In the UK, there were two very public cases where young children were ordered to die, by removing nutrition, (does that seek humane) because the court ruled that death was more humane than treatment.

The UK medical system determined that treatment was unlikely to help, so yeah, kill the kids. 

Treatment was available in one case in the USA and paid for, and treatment was available in Italy for the other child, with a helicopter waiting to move the child and the child being made an Italian citizen to try to help the UK courts let the parents move their child to try to get treatment.

In both cases the children died, in UK custody, without available treatment being attempted.

Would the treatment have worked? We don’t know, now we can’t know. But this is how we freaking learn. Where would we be if we had just accepted that HIV/AIDS was a “homosexual only disease” and that you just died in ten years.

We didn’t accept either, we studied it, we tried different treatments, we now know how it is transmitted and that it certainly is not just because of sexual preference.

Now there are treatments that can extend a patient’s life, and what we learned has helped in prevention. 


Are you comfortable with a court being able to stunt advancement in medical science? The choices made by a court and a NHS are not just medical. They are also fiscal, as you stay within budget by making choices to provide care or not to.

My brother is a retired US Marine, and will be on a cane / scooter for the rest of his life.

On government provided medical care while on active duty he broke his foot. They denied care, hurrying to send him back to Afghanistan instead. His foot swelled and his nerves were damaged.

If he was able to see a private doctor when his foot started to swell, he would very likely still have a healthy foot today, the damage was light.


Beyond that, the biggest problem we have in the USA is cost. It isn’t that proper don’t want insurance, it is that it is too costly. And our government isn’t interested in why it costs so much or how to fix the problem.

The ACA? It drove costs up, not down. The government refusing to look at big pharma, price fixing / gouging by insurers and TORT reform? That was ignoring the problem, because those industries are paid up through their lobbyists. 


The second biggest problem is the gross inefficiency of our federal government, they could mess up a cup of coffee. They do nothing efficiently, absolutely nothing.

When they got involved in home finance, the measures they passed lead to the housing bubble and crisis. When they got involved in funding a portion of college education behind the scenes, colleges happily cashed the blank checks and raised tuition well beyond inflation, because why not take more government money. When the US government got involved on healthcare it got more expensive, and insurance cost even more and provided even less.",fy1pyo8
Donald Trump will be re-elected in a landslide.,"Yes, he is currently trailing Joe Biden in most polls. However, I believe that Trump will not only win, but win handily. There are a few reasons why.

1. Biden is a centrist, unlikely to energize younger, more progressive voters. All he has done is alienate progressives with his promises to veto Medicare For All if it ever reached his desk.
2. Biden is in severe cognitive decline. Go look at the debates from 2012 between him and Paul Ryan, and then look at the debates he was in in 2019 and 2020. You'll see a noticeable difference, and Trump is going to eat him alive for this. He has trouble completing full sentences.

You might be wondering, ""Okay, it could be a tragic close loss, but surely not a landslide. What could possibly make you think that?"" This brings us to:

3. Trump is aiming to kill the United States Postal Service. If we have to conduct the 2020 election mainly by mail, this will make that impossible. It will be unsafe for people to vote in person in November, but the few people who are brave enough will be supporters of the candidate with more enthusiasm. That's Trump, hands-down. 

I will preface that I am a Democrat, and I do not want this to happen. I would very much like my view changed.",g04jh0,I think the past 4 years have taught us that polls don’t really mean anything,fnrf2za
US Colleges should not waste student's time with so many useless mandatory classes.,"I went to a very competitive college in the US, and I was astounded by the number of absolutely useless classes I had to take. For a Computer Science major, I had to take

\- Calculus, Linear Algebra, Discrete Math- Computer architecture (MIPS), Proving algorithms (including dynamic programming), How operating systems work, intro to electrical engineering. Some in this category I technically ""chose"" from a short list of alternatives, but I assure you the others were even less useful.

Also, depending on the school and major, Computer Science majors often have a gen ed which includes- One history class (EDIT: I have conceded in several posts that a history class rooted in research and writing is very useful for software engineering, most jobs in general, and life in general. I am pro-mandatory reading and writing classes)

\- One chemistry class

\- One art/music class

\- One physics class

In the end, I took about 4 classes that had really good an in-depth coding practice, and the rest were highly abstract and 100% useless for 90% of Computer Science jobs. I have never used one of those algorithms, linear algebra, discrete math, operating systems, or computer architecture in any software engineering job I've ever had, and I think 90% of software jobs would be the same.

Not only were all the above classes not useful in any of the jobs I worked, but I don't even remember 90% of the stuff I learned in them, since the human brain only has so much room, and the classes consist of extremely difficult and esoteric information. None of this would have been a problem if the classes weren't MANDATORY. I'm all for the school offering these classes for people who are interested, but my god make paths for people who just want a job that is like 90% of the software engineering jobs in the market. The reason I didn't limit the post title to Computer Science is because I know many other people who had to take classes which were not relevant to their major or not relevant to the real-world work in their field, and yet the classes were mandatory. In my estimation, what is happening is colleges are relying so much on the fact that students are naturally intelligent and hardworking that they don't really have to design a good curriculum. Smart, hardworking people get into the college, then the college may or may not teach you anything, then they leave and get a good job because they are smart and hardworking, the college keeps its reputation (even though it did nothing), and the cycle continues.

But I'm willing to Change My View. Do my friends and I just have bad memories, and other people actually remember the random stuff they are forced to learn? Is the ideal of a ""well-rounded"" education so strong that it doesn't even matter if the students actually remember anything as long as they are forced to learn it in the first place?

EDIT: Okay, thanks a lot everyone! I'm going to be slowing down now, I've read through hundreds of posts and responded to almost every post I read, and I'd like to sum up my understanding of the opposition in one word: Elitism. Unbelievable elitism. Elitism to think ""All the students who want software engineering jobs with a CS major (most of them) are dumb to want that and signed up for the wrong major. The ideals of the school should trump the wants of students and employers"". Elitist people who think that you need to hold the hands of future theory geniuses and  math savants, as if they would fail to be ambitious if all those classes were optional rather than mandatory. Elitist employers, who say they wouldn't trust an excellent software engineer who didn't know linear algebra. Elitist people, who think that you can afford to compromise your coding skills and graduate after taking only a few coding classes, because ""Hey, ya never know what life's gonna throw at you. Maybe in 30 years you'll remember taking linear algebra when you need to do something."" Elitist engineers (many of whom, I suspect can't code that well and are scared of people who can), who throw around terms like ""code monkey"", ""blast through jira tickets"", ""stay an entry-level software engineer your whole life"". To all you engineers who don't care for theory and math, If you ever wondered what your ""peers"" thought of you, read through this thread (Luckily, all these posters are in the minority, despite all their protests to the contrary). Elitist theorists, who think that you become an amazing software engineer by ""learning how to think like a mathematician"", as if the most excellent tennis players in the world got to be so by ""learning how to think like a basketball player."" Elitist ML and computer graphics engineers who think this type of work compromises more than a sliver of software engineering work and profess ""Linear algebra, it's everywhere in this field!!!"". And maybe worst of all, elitists who think that all people who attend elite universities should be elitists like them and refuse to be ""just a software engineer"". Deeply disappointing.

To all of the responses in support of the OP, and who shared their stories, sympathized with those who felt let down by the system, and to all those who were against me but maintained a civil tone without getting angry and insulting me ( I was told I lack critical thinking skills, don't understand how to learn or think, don't understand what college is for (as if there is a single right answer that you can look up in the back of the book), and I was also accused of attending various specific colleges, which was pretty funny), I say thank you for a wonderful discussion, and one that I hope we as a society can continue to have! &lt;3",ufdhhz,"""Calculus, Linear Algebra, Discrete Math""  
- um, dude, discrete math is the most useful class I had in college wrt to my software engineering career.  A computer is literally JUST a discrete math machine.  When you are just starting you won't see it quite as much, because you are just gluing other people's work together, but if you go deep you will see it a lot more.
- Linear Algebra is incredibly useful if you go into data science, neural networks, optimization algo, algo design, image processing, etc.  GPUs are basically Linear Algebra machines.
- Calculus is less useful, because computers generally are discrete and calculus isn't, but the concepts learned in calc are hella useful for any computation you end up doing later.
- Chemistry ... I'll give you chemistry.
- Physics... I'll give you physics, although the derivation skills I developed with a physics major have served me well as a software engineer.",i6vxm4o
The brown and black stripes on the pride flag are completely unnecessary at best and at worst racist.,"My view is predicated on the following:

* The brown and black stripes are there to represent queer people of color.
* The original rainbow pride flag was never a whites-only pride flag.
* White queer people, queer people of Asian descent, and pacific islander queer people are not having their races represented on this flag.

Therefore, by enumerating certain races on this symbol they *exclude* others. The pride flag was *never* intended to only represent white people. There were queer people of color at stonewall, at all the marches, and in the room when the advancements were made. I was never made to wave around a whites-only flag at pride. Is there something I'm missing here? Have I forgotten something? Misinterpreted something?",vm6z5k,I thought that the brown and black were also colors for gay bear pride.,ie1o5u3
There is nothing wrong with Peter Vlaming being fired,"So in 2018 a Virginian high school teacher was fired because they refused to use a transgender student's preferred pronouns.

Here is a link to an article about it [Link](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/teacher-fired-refusing-use-transgender-student-s-pronouns-n946006)

I actually found that watching the news story added new information compared to the article.

My position is as follows: 

* The school had policies prohibiting discrimination against gender identity
* The school disciplined Peter Vlaming and told them to use the correct pronoun for the transgender student, which is something they can do as their employer  
* Additionally, I agree with the argument that using pronouns for other students and then only using a name for another student is a form of discrimination(especially when mistaken misgendering occurs)
* The combination of Peter Vlaming violating school policy, misgendering(even mistakenly), and ignoring a directive from the principle to use a student's pronouns is a good enough reason to fire Peter.

I want my view changed or at least challenged because people think this has to do with free speech or is a form of compelled speech, but I don't see the problem.",c3enjl,"If we are going to do such extreme things, like denying biology and what is clearly in front of you, then we need extreme examples. 

You are arguing that there should NEVER be discrimination based on sex. But it happens every day all day. And you can’t simply cherry pick what you believe to be true. 

Example: If we are going to use denial of scientific data and biology as a defense for FORCING an individual to speak a certain way, then it must go ALL the way. 

That means childbirth for women is ABSOLUTELY forbidden. Sure, you can break the law, but you will be fined or jailed for doing so. Too extreme? Why is that? Is it because ignoring an absolute fact, like biology, is absurd? I agree. 

In addition, childbirth can’t simply be outlawed. Oh no! We must take it a step further and require every American to publicly admit and verbalize, that childbirth is discriminatory. It is a myth to believe that childbirth is only possible with women. That is CLEARLY discrimination of men. And women. It is not allowed. And if you want to live, work, play in our society, you MUST believe what we believe. If you do not, you will loose your job. Effectively denying you the ability to participate and live in our society. 

You think this is the only issue? Ha! Screw treatments for sickle cell anemia. That’s clearly racist. It’s simply not possible that a certain RACE is only able to get this disease. We will no longer support the racist organizations that dedicate all their funding to such racist research. These researchers are getting awfully close to being nazi’s. 

Sperm clinics? Pfff! Absolutely not. Women should be welcome to provide sperm. Discrimination. 

If I see one more man standing, and one more woman sitting, while they pee...in a government building bathroom where you are prohibited from discriminating, that’s it! Don’t give me this biology crap. Don’t give me this crap that there is a difference between genitalia. I’m not buying it. It’s sexist. It’s discrimination. And I will NOT allow anyone else to believe differently. Much less speak differently!!",f27e8ep
Eating meat purely for pleasure is inherently a cruel practice,"Groups of people this view does not apply to:

* People who *need* to eat meat for health (i.e. have vitamin deficiencies that can only reasonably be addressed by eating meat, other health conditions, etc.)
* People who practice traditional lifestyles and diets that are reliant on meat consumption for survival (i.e. the Maasai in Kenya) 
* People whose religious practices mandate the consumption of animal flesh
* People whose economic conditions make meat consumption necessary (i.e. if you live somewhere where you can only avoid starvation by spending the limited income you have on meat, although I think this is probably a pretty rare case)

This view *does* apply to anyone who is capable of eating a vegetarian/vegan diet healthfully, without causing undue economic hardship or creating negative social consequences, and chooses to eat meat anyway.

I posted about this years ago and did not hear any arguments I found particularly compelling, but attitudes/rationales change over time and I'd love to revisit it to see if there's something I haven't considered.

The argument is:

If you don't have to kill a sentient creature for sustenance, then you only do it for recreation. To deny an animal the right to its own life when many animals can clearly express a preference to preserve their lives is, in a literal sense, cruelty. It's important to note here that I don't believe cruelty necessarily has an emotional component -- I don't think people who eat meat need to derive pleasure from doing so in order for the act to be cruel. The cruelty arises from depriving a creature of its life unnecessarily when it is clear (especially in the cases of the mammals and birds we most commonly eat) that that creature would prefer to remain alive. In other words, it is cruel to take a cow's life when that cow clearly wants to be alive.

Even if an animal cannot clearly express a preference to preserve its own life (i.e. an oyster cannot cry out in pain or physically move away from a predator after it's been taken out of the water), the self-preservation instinct is so common in animals that we must reasonably assume all animals possess it unless we have reason to believe otherwise.

Arguments I've heard that I don't find compelling:

- ""The number of animals we raise for food is too many to survive in the wild, so those animals have to die anyway"" -- yes, but we didn't have to raise that many to begin with, and we certainly don't have to continue breeding them in artificially huge numbers. The path forward that would minimize the impact of the cruelty we've already created in breeding them would be not to breed any more and let their population reach sustainable levels or, in the case of animals that have artificially selected genetics that make them badly adapted for survival in the wild, let them die out completely as they would in nature.

- ""Animals eat other animals all the time"" -- we cannot dictate morality to animals. Maybe a bear is capable of eating only berries and surviving, but the bear is following its own bear instincts when it chooses to eat meat. We are capable of overriding our human instincts, and do so all the time in order to live in the modern world. That capability is the basis of morality, i.e. ""what *should* I do?"" rather than simply ""what *can* I do?"" We do not have an obligation to subject animals to human morality, nor are we absolved from our own moral responsibility by the existence of animals that behave differently from us. For example, many primate species attack and kill members of other primate tribes when they meet in the wild. Humans, though, do not generally view murder as a morally acceptable solution to encountering people of different races, religions, tribes, etc.

- ""Our bodies have evolved to eat meat"" -- this is an appeal to nature and not rational. Our bodies have evolved to run long distances -- most of us don't do that regularly. As a species we only started eating grains in meaningful quantities in the past ~10K years, but most of us today eat grains regularly, and our evolution hasn't really caught up to that. The way the great majority of people live today is not dictated by our evolution because we've used our big human brains to create external solutions to most of the environmental pressures that shaped our adaptive roadmap. Similarly, evolution is not relevant to this question because we have reached a point where most of us are able to thrive without eating meat.

- ""Animals have to die in order to grow vegetables/fruits/grains too"" -- this is a good faith argument but one that doesn't have a lot of basis in fact. We kill literal billions of animals a year for food -- and we also have to grow very, *very* large amounts of grains/vegetables in order to feed them. Eliminating the number of animals we eat would also eliminate a massive amount of need for farmed crops -- by most estimates, more than would be needed to feed the humans that are now only eating plants. So in a net sense, if the world stopped eating meat tomorrow, it is almost certain that in time (after current animal stock reaches sustainable levels), far fewer animals would die as a result of our actions each year.

CMV.",tkannn,"You made a jump from unnecessary to cruelty, basically an ""Is ought fallacy"". It may be true that it is unnecessary (for our own survival) to eat meat. That does not imply that we SHOULD NOT eat meat. 

If you define cruelty simply as causing unnecessary harm that may again be true, but fails to provide a justification of why that should stop. 

You said in comment that We have broadly accepted ""preserve life and minimize harm"". I disagree. I think it would be more accurately stated that we have broadly accepted to preserve HUMAN life and minimize human harm. 

If morality is essentially arbitrary, we are left with consensus about our framework. If the broadly accepted values are the framework, there is nothing to justify your conclusion. 

You say later that ""you're extending the consideration to animals"". That's great. I just simply do not accept that. And until you find broad consideration and acceptance, I do not find you have a basis for your claim other than your own arbitrary whim, which is no more valuable than my own. 

Me personally, I would only extend ethical/moral consideration to another moral agent that could extend the same to me. This seems to make sense, because we would operate in a world where they can consider their actions against me and vice versa. As animals (broadly speaking) cannot do that, I do not extend to them ethical consideration.",i1pbp7h
State owned broadcasting companies should not rely on forced payments from the states citizens.,"I don't know how widespread this phenomenon is, it might just be norwegian one for all I know.

We have [NRK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRK) which is our state-controlled broadcasting company. They deliver a wide range of services such as TV, radio and all kinds of stuff on their web page. Really, it's a quite vast collection of things they offer. Generally their content is quite good, and they produce content for all ages and contexts (family friendly, young etc). However, payment for their services is _not_ optional. Everybody has to pay (_currently you can get away through a loophole, but next year that is no longer an option_).

Note this bit in the wiki-section about their financing:

&gt; About 94% of NRK's funding comes from a mandatory annual licence fee payable by anyone who owns or uses a TV or device capable of receiving TV broadcasts.

The way I read this, is that there is no way to know for sure whether this company survives because it offers a service that's high in demand, or if it survives because it's forced onto everyone and it's punishable to not pay.

I am firmly of the belief that as far as entertainment goes, it should be the survival of the fittest. It should be dictated by supply and demand, and if the demand is _not_ there, then there obviously is not a legitimate case for the continued existance of the service. 

Operating like this is effectively coerced crowdfunding of entertainment. Imagine if Netflix did this, or HBO or some other entertainment company. I really do not understand why it is OK that some government controlled company gets to do this (_keep in mind I am talking in the context of a democratic country_).

I believe tradition is a key reason this has not been challenged before (*if it has, then I believe tradition is the reason it did not succeed then*), but to me that makes it even more wrong.

**edit**: From 01. jan 2020, NRK will no longer send out a bill to people. Instead, it will get baked into the taxes, and they will collect the fee from that route. It will result in more people paying (as this effectively gets rid of the loophole of not owning a TV), so I think they've lowered the fee somewhat to compensate.",ds1h1f,"&gt;I am firmly of the belief that as far as entertainment goes, it should be the survival of the fittest. It should be dictated by supply and demand, and if the demand is not there, then there obviously is not a legitimate case for the continued existance of the service.

But is there a case to be made for things with a niche demand that wouldn't make them competitively profitable? The BBC can often be more experimental, with shorter runs of more varied shows, than American tv production can justify. Just talk to a Firefly fan for an example of how profit-driven production can kill off shows that have a huge following - but not that huge to justify their cost. 

Aside from that, is it only entertainment that should be on TV? Just look at the US's ""History Channel"" for an example of how being terrible is actually more profitable than being informative. In the US beloved, informative doc series like NOVA or Planet Earth ran exclusively on public broadcasting. These aren't profitable enough for the big networks. And the same goes for a lot of quality children's programming.",f6mfvo7
There is nothing inherently bad about nationalism.,"Just so I’m clear I don’t hate anyone and I don’t support hate against anyone. I’m against colonization and war. I’m generally left wing for most of my views. I don’t want to change any other nations and I don’t want other countries to think like me. I just don’t see anything wrong with wanting to protect ones culture and history.

If I was Finnish I would want to keep Finland’s history alive. I would want to keep alive the history of the Finnish writers, philosophers, musicians, and other great people. A more globalist view of things would be fine with the loss of cultures. If the Finnish authors die out in favors of American writers which are more popular there is nothing wrong with that. If all the buildings were to be torn down and replaced with skyscrapers there would be no problem with that. Obviously not everyone thinks like this but it's generally agreed to some extent by most people. 

I see nationalism as a good thing because it tries to protect the culture at all costs. Obviously you can’t stop the changing of culture but I think you can delay or speed the process. If you are to kill an entire group of people you would immediately wipe out the culture. If you colonize the group you can remove their culture and implant your own. If you are to displace a group you can irreversibly change their culture. This among hundreds of others things are why I think nationalism is a good thing. It’s not to hurt anyone else but to protect what you have.",nd6bn5,"Whose culture and history are we protecting with nationalism? You gave a seemingly fitting example with Finnish culture, but Finland is an exceptionally homogenous nation.

How would nationalism be of any benefit to Lakota culture in the US, or to Uyghur culture in China, or Jewish culture under the extremely nationalistic (it's in the name after all) Nazi party? One could argue that nationalism and it's consequences are actively destructive to cultures and only rarely protect them.",gy93fsn
Any claim that a system is inherently X is always too simplistic,"**UNDER LYING CLAIM**

An adjective used to describe an object/system never applies to the object/system as a whole, it applies to a subset of aspects of the system/object that exhibit that adjective.

**EXAMPLES**

ie. is a society ever 100% liberal? No, there are elements of it that are liberal, but not all of it. ie. a stipulation that garbage collection in some street should take place on Tuesdays has no element of ""liberal"".

is a society ever 100% modern? No, there are elements of the society that don't exhibit the aspect of ""modern"", say protections for heritage buildings overlay.

A less satisfying example:

is  a cheetah 100% fast? No, it has muscular legs that make it fast, whilst  it's stomach has no explicit attributes that contribute to its land  speed.Are its legs 100% fast?No, it is a combination of other things  within the legs that manifest ""fast"" and some other things that don't  contribute to manifest ""fast"".

**EXPLANATION**

The validity of the above claims should be falsifiable, ie. a hypothesis could be made that they are false and if data indicates this hypothesis false, then the claim is valid depending on the validity of the data.

**EXAMPLE**

By extension, I believe a % could be applied for what percentage of the aspects of the object make up the adjective, ie. that a system is 45% liberal, 30% modern, 90% secular, 10%  libertarian, 14% American etc. (Percentages could overlap to sum to be  greater than 100%)

Obviously it would be a fuzzy assignment of a %, but a hypothesis could be claimed.

With that, our goal should be to minimise the adjective percentages of things that we believe are against some core set of values, which I would claim should be liberal value of humanity, individual responsibility/agency, truth, logic, faith and science.

**MOTIVATION**

I could rambling nonsense here, but I believe this provides a testable way to understand what percentage% the claim that any adjective could be attributed to the US society, or societies/systems in general.

Anyone can make a claim about a system, sure why not, but the legitimacy of some claim should be proportional to the probability of the aspects that exhibit the attribute of that adjective in a testable, falsifiable way.

And also tempers any 100% adjective claims as I think I showed above that that shouldn't apply of any adjective to any object.

Discussions or understandings that make 100% claims seem to me always overly simplistic, and overly ""sith""-like.

edit 1:

**SEEMING CONTRADICTION**

My claim only applies to objects/systems that exist in reality. It doesn't not apply to ideas or things that have no material component. So it is fine for 100% adjectives to be applied to ideas, so my claim is not self-contradictory.  


edit 2:  
I've changed my mind.

It is still an incomplete claim, but my understanding has changed to be:

What I've learned in this thread is that I've melded the words,  essential and characteristic. ie. the claim that a photon is massless is  an essential claim(removing the massless would no longer make it a  photon), and that a pineapple is spikey is a characteristic claim(you  could remove the things that make it spikey and it would still be a  pineapple.) 

where does this leave the ""fast"" cheetah? It descends into an issue of taxonomy and I'd rather not tread that path.  
",hxxl6m,"I agree that 100%, all or nothing, black and white views are usually wrong, but I’m not sure what your argument is here. Can you give an example of a claim that is commonly made that fits you description? I’ve never heard anyone say that a society is 100% liberal or a cheetah is 100% fast.",fz98m4m
The Death penalty is never right in any circumstance,"So, my opinion of the death penalty is based in four arguments:

One, many people say that the death penalty is cheaper, and less of a burden on taxpayers than a life sentence, but from what I've see, it's largely more expensive to kill someone than to keep them in prison for life, so I don't think that's a great argument, though if it was done correctly I could see how the death penalty would be cheaper.

Two, I truly don't think the death penalty is a good deterrent to crime. From what I know, many if not most of murders are like spur of the moment things. Like most of the time when someone murders they aren't weighing the consequences in their head, they just do it. Same with rape and other crimes.

Three, I don't think that the death penalty in the way we have it is a safe bet as far as screening out innocent individuals. As far as I know, a not insignificant portion of death row inmates are innocent, as as much as our justice system tries to prevent this, many innocent people get killed. I don't see how a system that even lets a few innocent people get murdered by the state is a system we should keep in place.

Four,  even if it IS cheaper and a better deterrent as well as being foolproof, I don't think anyone, no matter how guilty, should be murdered by the state. Not only is execution often very painful, but I don't agree that life is something the state should ever have the authority to legally take. I also don't see how many politicians who support the death penalty also say they support small government when in my opinion, state-sponsored killing is the epitome of too-large government.

I'm open to differing opinions, and if anyone wants sources I can definitely cite them in a comment.

Edit: To clarify, I mean under any circumstance in the developed society of the United States. I do not mean ever, just in the society I live in and know best. Sorry if that was unclear.",gmsjiw,"Make the overall punishments lower but have a higher ceiling id say, but death penalty is honestly not enough suffering",fr5j2nr
"Statues of controversial historical figures should not be torn down. Instead, context should be clearly displayed, and we should push to erect more statues and monuments that provide a counter point to white washed history.","My view is basically, we should acknowledge our history with context. We should build and grow, rather than destroy. We should look for the historical figures that have been overlooked, and erect monuments as a counter point, rather than tearing down the ones that no longer reflect our values. 

In my home town there are dozens of statues that were erected by the daughters of the confederacy. They are displayed prominently throughout the town. This organization has managed to white wash our history, and oppress the black community over 100 years span. The statues have visible plaques saying things like these men and boys gave their lives to protect the citizens from tyranny or something along those lines. I believe the words on the plaque are what truly matters. If the plaque gave true historical context, we wouldn’t need to remove the entire monument. 

Another example from this same town. Our city had an actual coup, where a white mob burned black businesses, and took over the government. This is an event that everybody should be aware of who lives in the city or visits our historical downtown. Last year, the city erected a plaque, detailing the events of the coup, in plain language without sugar coating anything. To me, that is so powerful to see. I read it every time I walk past it. 

I think this contextualization of history is more powerful than removing what existed before. Build monuments to this black business owners who lost everything, the ones who tried to fight for their communities in the face of oppression. Build statues of the amazing people who have contributed to our society, and have been overlooked for a century. Let these serve as a counterpoint to the confederate statues. Let the confederate statues stand, with the context that reminds us what really happened. We will see that they are not something that is glorified, but a symbol of what actually happened.",h12ca9,"From your description I am thinking Wilmington NC.

[Silver is such a good antimicrobial that settlers would put silver coins in their milk to make it last significantly longer.](https://www.thriftyfun.com/tf47824676.tip.html#:~:text=Tip%3A%2099.9%25%20Silver%20to%20Keep%20Milk%20and%20Water%20Fresh&amp;text=The%20pioneers%20who%20traveled%20west,keep%20the%20milk%20fresh%20longer.)
* It's hard to counterfeit. That's because the value of the coin comes from the silver content itself - if you were to counterfeit a coin out of silver, it would still be valuable - since it would be made of silver! And it's easy to tell if a coin isn't real silver with a few basic tests anyone can do at home.
* It would create a lot of jobs in the mining industry.
* The money itself would be more resistant to physical damage. If you rip a dollar bill in half, you just lost your money. But if you (somehow) manage to break a silver dollar in half - it's still valuable. Even if you melt it back down, it would hold roughly the same value as before you damaged it.
* The OGs endorsed it. The Framers of the US Constitution had just financed the Revolutionary War by using Continental Dollars - a paper currency which they printed into oblivion to pay for the war. Their dollar failed due to hyperinflation, and everyone's savings went kaput. So they wrote that wisdom they gained directly into the Constitution, Article 10 Section 1:

&gt;No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; **make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts;**

* It keeps prices low and stops inflation from eroding away the minimum wage. Every few years we have a new debate about minimum wage because of inflation. People suffer while waiting for that debate to conclude. We're all getting tired of that repetitious debate. [But old silver coins *still* hold their value to this day.](https://schiffgold.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/lates-sign.jpg) All other things being equal, if we had never taken the silver out of our coins, and we left the minimum wage untouched since the 60s, leaving it at $1.25, the minimum wage would equal a modern value of ~$27.


That being said, I am aware there are downsides. It's heavy. Industry uses silver in electronics. Vending machine manufacturers would need to update their equipment.

But my view is the upsides outweigh the downsides and switching to silver money would benefit our society in all sorts of ways, ranging all the way from public health to counterfeit prevention to economic safety nets for our minimum wage earners.",n5vk7w,There isn't enough silver to go around,gx3kx2o
Men do not feel (and are not) safe walking in the street at night either. It isn't smart to do so for either gender.,"Following Britain's Sarah Everard case (girl abducted and killed by police officer) there has been a series  of outcries by the women on social media and the larger media painting the picture that somehow women are particularly under a constant fear, persecution and danger of attack that men in the society justsee or feel. There's even a politician that  dared to make the argument that maybe men should have a 6pm curfew to protect women.

Now I am not saying women shouldn't feel safe but the world is dangerous and however you cut it women are physically smaller beings and their size makes them easier targets generally speaking, so they should be more diligent about exposing themselves to dangerous situations.

But even as a 6'0 martial artist man I have never felt ""safe"" walking at night either. Especially in any secluded areas or streets. I constantly have my head on a swivel, and if I am walking through any woodland area I will literally break a branch off a tree as a ""walking stick"" just in case.  Young black boys in the UK carry knives to feel safe, American men carry guns.  I think it's inaccurate to assume men are not fearful about being victimised at night.  
I think it's inaccurate to think women are unique in their fear or that men are any safer on the street at night than women.

In conclusion:  I don't think the fact that women FEEL more unsafe than men walking at night is relevant when the actual victims of violence are overwhelmingly men. 
For the girl Sarah Everard, I think walking 50 mins in the dark at night was not a smart move, she took an uneccesary risk, and unfortunately for her she paid with her life.


EDIT: Deltas awarded that have changed my view slightly are -
1: The fear men feel from being victimised are lessened because we have an understanding that when we are faced with an attacker we are rarely the possession that the assailants want. Men have a semblance of control in that by cooperating and giving the criminal what they want will often end the situation leaving us unharmed. The same is not always true for women as even after cooperating and handing over all valuable possessions they face the very real risk of still being sexualy violated. 

2: Because of the fear and precautions women take already (and the seemingly ignorant false sense of security men have) the statistics of violent crime arelikely heavily skewed. If women had the same sense of security that so many men have regarding safety, the number MAY likely show that women are at consistently greater risk of being targeted than their male counter parts. This would need some real statistical evidence for me to fully subscribe to this point. So far we have non.",m4ro76,"&gt;But even as a 6'0 martial artist man I have never felt ""safe"" walking at night either.  

Never? Really? Where do you live? I have hardly ever felt unsafe walking around at night.",gqw4x5j
Civil political discussion is dead.,"It's amazing how if you look back at videos of political discussions and debates from even just a couple of decades ago, people are much more respectful and open to having their views challenged than nowadays. And this is true of all groups. 

Today, it's hard to have any remotely right-wing person speak without Antifa shouting over them and pulling the fire alarm, or to have any remotely left-wing person speak without being framed as a Communist and ignored. The words ""Fascist"" and ""Communist"" get thrown around so much that they've lost all meaning. Hardly anyone is willing to sit down and genuinely consider the other side's ideas, oftentimes on the mere principle of what the opposition identifies as politically. News sources have devolved into echo-chambers (which is likely part of the reason why all of this is happening), and everyone has an ""I'm right, you're wrong"" mindset and attitude. And probably worst of all, people are so dedicated and entrenched in their ideals that even objective, irrefutable facts which prove that they're wrong still isn't enough to sway them.

So if you ask me, any semblance of political civility, especially amongst average people, is dead. Change my mind.",ks4sfb,You can't have polite political discourse with people who think that its ok to deny rights to people based on their skin color or sexual orientation.,gie0kol
"If RGB dies before the election, the Senate should do the ""honorable"" thing, and not confirm a justice until after the 2020 general election.","[RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg) for those unaware on who I am referencing.

The reason why: [To recap, Garland was nominated to fill the 2016 vacancy on the Supreme Court created by the death that February of Justice Antonin Scalia, an icon of conservative jurisprudence.](https://www.npr.org/2018/06/29/624467256/what-happened-with-merrick-garland-in-2016-and-why-it-matters-now).  

President Barack Obama quickly named Merrick Garland, then 63, to fill the seat.

But even before Obama had named Garland, and in fact only hours after Scalia's death was announced, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declared any appointment by the sitting president to be null and void. He said the next Supreme Court justice should be chosen by the next president — to be elected later that year.

RGB has well documented health issues and there is a greater than zero chance she will pass away before the year end, if not a chance before the election.

**The Senate should hold the same rules they did in 2016, to let the election happen and allow the President to nominate a justice**.  

Reasons: The Senate has set precedent.  While they don't need to always follow it, the same senate majority leader is in place so it would be hypocritical for him to backtrack on what he started.  If there is/was a major change in the senate majority leadership, I would understand if they wanted to reverse precedent established by Mitch.  

Appointing justices should not be a political issue.  The SCOTUS is there to rule on cases which impact laws and shape our country.  They should carry their duties without involving politics.  I understand people have personal politics but the process should be done without politics (left vs right, dems vs republicans, etc).  The best person should be confirmed regardless of what President nominates them.

**What may change my view**

Many people criticized Mcconnel for what he did in 2016.  If the senate does not follow the same guidance they issued in 2016 and were able to give a good reason, my mind would change.  For the record, I did not agree with Mitch in 2016 but do feel he needs to somewhat atone for his mistake in 2016.",e31b8l,"&gt; The Senate has set precedent.

"The reason religions are against homosexuality is because those couples do not ""generate"" children that can be added to their followers. (long)","Edit: going to sleep now, thanks to everyone who answered, will come back in the morning there I a few other answers I want to make


IMO, behind most religious rules, there is a reasoning  (i am mainly speaking about christianity, judaism and islam because i don't know much about others, as such when i say ""the three religions"" I am referring to those). Before I begin, i should point out that you will not change my view on the fact that holy books (bible, thorah, coran) were written by people and are not ""the voice of god"". They are a product of their times (multiple times at least in the case of the bible).

 Sometimes, the rules make sense. For instance, some rules are a way (outdated imo but not the point) to improve sanitation in diet: removing pork reducing the risks of badly cooking it, giving up meat for some time and other stuff... You also do not want people to kill each others in your society, have a rest day/week for everyone, etc... You could argue that those are rules that religions sacralized in order to have a better society.

In the three religions, it is the sacred duty of couples to make children and raise them to be good \[choose your religion\]. Fair enough, if you believe in heaven, hell, souls, etc... I guess it is in the best interest of the children to be educated this way. I would argue that it's nobody's buisness if i have children or not and if i teach them a religion as long as they behave correctly but for a believer in good faith it makes sense.

HOWEVER, my concern is the intolerance of religion towards homosexuality. As far as i understand, the main grief that religions have with homosexual couples is that they are ""unnatural because they do not create children"" (maybe this is the main point that i am not understanding but most of what i see seems to be around this theme). This makes me reevaluate the previous point. Maybe i'm just cynical but it seems like religions want their follower to have children because it will ""automatically"" increase their number of followers (in times where religions wars were more common, also today having a large number of follower increases your credibility). Otherwise, why would they give a capital punishment (today is somewhat better, there are branches in the three religions more accepting but there are still religious countries with harsh punishment for homosexuality as a consequence of early days) for this? 

This is more speculative but interestingly enough, lesbianism is not mentionned in the thorah (and AFAIK much less than male homosexuality in the bible), my guess is that women were wed regardless, men had more choice not to be wed. As long as they (at least pretended well enough? to) try to have children with men there was no reason to explicitely adress anything.

People have always loved sex, there was never a risk of humans going extinct because we don't reproduce (especially before contraception). The combination between couples having a sacred duty to have children and raise them in the religion and the rejection of homosexuality because they do not produce children makes me think that religions want people to have children to grow their numbers. By extention, homosexual couples are stigmatized  because they cannot procreate.",inov1s,"I have been wondering about this for a while as well. However I don’t think this is the case for these reasons: 

There are many religious people (at least in my family and friends) who don’t mind homosexuality at all. That is because some realise that religion is personal, that a lot of religious books contradict themselves, dictate rules for a society which is long gone or should be interpreted rather than taken literal.

There were deeply religious societies in the past which didn’t mind homosexuality (I’m basing this on Romans and Greeks, though “didn’t mind” is obviously too general, they just didn’t mind it for the reasons you named), and today a homosexual relationship doesn’t automatically mean that having children is impossible.

These days, science has answered many questions that previously needed religion, causing people to either not rely on religion as much in their life or just abandon it altogether. From this I wonder if people who don’t stop relying on religion for political views might just be so conservative that accepting homosexuality might also be a step too far.

Anyway it’s possible that this idea is just completely incorrect, but these are my thoughts.",g49ko18
Ad Blockers hurt the free Internet,"Ads are the main way that otherwise free software services are able to exist. Isn't using ad blockers to access services that depend on ads to run basically theft?  

The usual arguments I hear about this:  

1) Privacy concerns. To be honest, this point seems moot. Google maps [was mining](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/13/google-location-tracking-android-iphone-mobile) people's locations even if GPS was turned off, by geo-locating wireless networks that the phone connected to. Apple, much lauded for their privacy stance, suffered break-ins into their cloud services that leaked famous people's nudes online. A website operator can identify you even behind a proxy by digital fingerprinting -- the combination of your browser brand and version, screen resolution, and a bunch of other stuff. You can look at your own fingerprint [here](https://amiunique.org/). I believe that by participating in consumer high technology, you have implicitly already sacrificed your privacy. All other talk of private online browsing is only lip service (unless you're running like Kali Linux and doing all your browsing on Tor, which most people don't, and if you do, you will find that the level of functionality on the web drops precipitously due to Tor not having Javascript turned on by default). We currently do not have the technological means (or consumer-grade devices) to stop a motivated individual from spying on us via tech.  

2) They're annoying. I can get down with that. Generally, when a product annoys me, I stop using it. News sites that are unreadable because only 15% of their screen real estate is content, with everything else being ads, are not used by me. This one seems real simple. If it's shit, don't use it. If enough people do this, the website operators will have to respond as this affects their bottom line.  

3) Virus/security concerns. I'm not too well versed on this subject, but a quick google showed me that most security issues with ads happen when consumers click on a FREE VIRUS SCANNER or YOU WON'T LAST 5 MINUTES PLAYING THIS GAME type of ads. Ad delivery networks do their best to filter these out, and some onus does fall on you, the consumer, to keep your wits about you on the net. I haven't seen a major virus outbreak from an ad that infects you upon simply viewing the ad on a website (experts can feel free to provide examples where this DID happen and I will eat a crow).  

So, the view I am espousing is two-fold: one, as stated in the title, that ad blockers hurt the free Internet. Two, following from that, is that using ad blockers is morally equivalent to theft. That said, it seems that a lot of people not only use ad blockers, but take a certain pride in doing so. At the risk of being the ""it's not me that's wrong, it's everyone else"" guy, I wanted to hear people's takes and justifications for ad blockers and see if I'm missing a part of the puzzle.",jhu2lf,"Adblockers block way more than just advertisements, e.g. auto-playing content videos can be blocked as well. Even supposedly reputable news sites such as AP News engage in this type of behavior. I'd claim that avoiding all products which annoy you is simply impossible nowadays. 

What is your stance on partial ad-blockers? Block intrusive advertising like popus, but allow various forms of non-intrusive advertising (e.g. Google search ads). IMO this is good for the free internet, because it directly pressures publishers to avoid bad advertising practices. I think we need a more widespread version of this.

&gt; using ad blockers is morally equivalent to theft

What if I'm already paying $100/yr for e.g. a Washington Post subscription, but I still see advertising interrupt my reading on a mobile device on the official WaPo app while signed in? It's like the company trying to squeeze you for more money after you've already paid for their service. Is it still theft to block the ads?

Lastly, most types of advertising feel completely pointless. In the WaPo example, I am always seeing ads for Amazon products that I've already looked at the day before, which provides 1) no useful information and 2) no additional incentive to buy it whatsoever. How exactly is it morally equivalent to theft for me to block said ad? The fact that said ad even exists in the first place is probably a result of people confusing correlation with causation. Theft requires a loss of potential value from an affected party.",ga3uk87
We are over thinking the housing crisis. Just incentivize the building of more homes.,"This isn’t my area of expertise, so there’s a chance that my mind will be changed in record time. However, I keep hearing about subsidized housing, rent control, and low income housing. From my perspective, the solution is to deemphasize these programs and go all-in on encouraging the private sector to build new apartments and condos…a LOT of them. Whether it is through tax incentives, eminent domain, changes in zoning, or the auctioning of public land to developers, an increase in inventory will stop prices from skyrocketing and will hopefully drive them down. Supply and demand. 

I don’t mind adding in some stipulations that a portion of new construction has to go to low income families, but the focus should be shovels in the ground. If the inventory is high enough, there won’t be as great of a need for subsidies, rent control, or dedicated low income housing. I don’t even care if most of the new construction is targeted for the wealthy. As everyone moves up a level, there will be increased inventory at the bottom of the price scale. 

The approach should be similar to the Fed and interest rates, how they change the rates to address needs in the economy. If housing prices start to rise faster than inflation, then highly incentivize the construction of new units. If home prices drop too much, pull back the incentives. 

I think the roadblock to this plan is wealthy real estate developers and current homeowners who don’t want to see their investments DECREASE in value. These people don’t mind that others are struggling to find affordable housing, and since the wealthy developers influence politics, all we get are programs that look good from a distance but don’t solve the real problems.",uwdr0m,"Low income housing attracts “low income behavior”, which drives down property values and makes homes harder to sell.

Vegans should consume cricket flour and other cricket based products,"For simplicity sake, I'd like to just contain this view to consuming cricket flour alone. I don't want this discussion to delve down to finding a singular insect product that is an exception.

&amp;#x200B;

Nutritionally, cricket flour is fantastic. It has an immense amount of protein, and very low net carbs.

&amp;#x200B;

Even vegans ""draw a line"" over which animals are acceptable to suffer, and which are not. They are like omnivores, just with a different line. Vegans typically aren't as concerned about the mice, other rodents, bunnies, and birds that die to harvest crops that they consume when compared to pigs, cows, sheep, and chickens.

&amp;#x200B;

Compared to a bunny, insects are far less likely to experience suffering.

&amp;#x200B;

Insects are easily renewable, and don't require as much space to harvest. Also they can be farmed locally. One could get their protein from local insect farms, instead of tofu, or other protein sources, which has ingredients that can only be grown in certain locations.

&amp;#x200B;

Since vegans are not fruitarians, one can safely assume they are okay with \*\*some\*\* animal suffering; The question is just which animals are acceptable to suffer, and which are not? I would argue that most vegans would prefer that insects suffer (if you think they can suffer at all), rather than bunnies, mice, and birds.",cefsgn,"Can you be sure that farming crickets would result in less indirect killing of animals than farming plants?

The most efficient way to end police brutality is to make cops criminally liable for their actions on the job and stop funding their legal defense with public money.,"I think this is the fastest way to reduce incidents of police brutality. Simply make them accountable the same as everyone else for their choices.

If violent cops had to pay their own legal fees and were held to a higher standard of conduct there would be very few violent cops left on the street in six months.

The system is designed to insulate them against criminal and civil action to prevent frivolous lawsuits from causing decay to civil order, but this has led to an even worse problem, with an even bigger impact on civil order.

"Unless you have an allergy, or there are other extenuating circumstances, buying a dog from a breeder rather than adopting a dog from a shelter is selfish, vain, and stems from wanting a dog that fits your aesthetic, or from wanting a puppy over a dog, rather than from caring about animals.","I can completely understand why someone would need to purchase a hypoallergenic dog if they have a dander allergy, or why someone would need to seek out a breed with a certain mentality to fit their living situation. However, I'm of the belief that it's absolutely possible to find a good match at an SPCA or Humane Society if you search hard enough in your general geographical area, and I can't help but feel as though the only reason someone would choose to buy from a breeder over adopting from a shelter is because they want an aesthetically pleasing dog. Australian Shepherds are a good current example of this I think -- they're *very* trendy. 

I think it's OK if people are honest about wanting a purebred dog or a trendy dog, but it seems as though, oftentimes, the people that buy from breeders claim to be ""animal lovers"" or ""dog lovers"". I'm not saying that they can't be, I just feel as though adopting dogs that have been abandoned, surrendered, or seized better reflects caring about animals.

r/AskWomen's moderation has caused it to become a less successful subreddit than r/AskMen,"In my opinion, AskWomen could be equal to AskMen, but it is being held back by excessively strict implementation of some of the sub's rules.

For the most part, I don't have a problem with most of the rules, except one. There is a rule in AskWomen called ""No derailing"", which doesn't make sense to me. Conversations naturally go in different directions, and just because it's not directly answering the topic doesn't mean that it's not relevant. Restricting discussions to a specific topic and completely shutting down any remotely tangential ideas does not seem like it would attract people looking to talk on a place like Reddit. Popular threads also get locked within a few hours of posting, limiting further discussion on any topic.

In comparison, AskMen has a much more hands off approach towards discussions. They have their own rules and those rules are enforced, but the enforcing of those rules don't diminish the overall quality of the sub.

And the numbers show for it. Despite being created at almost the same time, a month apart, AskWomen has half the subscribers that AskMen does. In addition, by looking at the top posts in both subs over the past year, AskWomen's posts have maybe about 20% of the upvotes and comments that AskMen has.

I can only attribute this to AskWomen's moderation making it an undesirable and unattractive place for people to be on, but I think it would be way more popular if the mods let loose on the rules a little.",gp8mwn,"Why is having more subscribers automatically a measure of success?

"If you're watching a TV series or film that you've seen before with someone who hasnt seen it before, saying ""he will be a big character"" about someone who has just been introduced is such a spoiler."," 

Pretty much self explanatory.

A reason i say this is an unpopular opinion, is because literally everyone does it.

"Austin, TX is and has been the most overrated city in the U.S. for some time.","I lived down here from 04'-06' and then moved away for a long time. I live here again now (for about a year) and remember why I left the first time. Thinking of moving again. My reasons are as follows:

1. Drivers. Everyone complains about the the traffic, but it isn't actually the congestion or the number of cars, it is the ""hurry up,"" shit driving skills. Texan friends blame a recent influx of Californians, but the drivers sucked back in 04' too.  Big, huge, unnecessary (for the none laborers) trucks being driven like shit by idiots or smaller cars driven by those whose only thought is: ""me."" Teaching my wife to drive for the first time when she got here has been a nightmare. She is either run over or she learns bad habits to keep from being run over.

2. Everything is bland looking. Yes, I know the winters are mild, but the lack of 4 distinct seasons has me longing for color.  I know the ""hill country"" can be pretty, but overall the city is a big swath of beige and driving through the few pretty parts is ruined because of shit drivers (see above). Oh...and as a perk, you get 4 months out of the year that are worthless unless you have a boat or a pool or don't like breathing while you run.

3. Tech overload. I work in Tech. Jobs are good. I'm glad they are down here and I owe them my gratitude for employment. I get it. Yet, the constant bombardment of $500 words I hear out of the mouths of people because they are  feel overly important makes me want to take a fat shit. Ideally in their mouths.  It is starting to feel like the boys in Silicon Valley down here and all the doucheness that entails. Bring on the Elon fans to shout me down. 

4. Keep Austin Weird. This sentiment is still there, but has mostly lost out to the influx of people. What you get is a ""rally"" almost daily at the capital building of the craziest liberals, only to be shouted down by the good ol' boy Texan traditionalist. The middle ground would be the tech douches that I am a part of and disdain.  The Keep Austin Weird vibe kept this city from developing legitimate mass transit when it was proposed and they had time (point #1) Now all I see are 2-3 tiny trains that are mostly empty that tax dollars were blown on. 

5. Price to value. This isn't Aspen, NYC, Bern, or Tokyo prices,  but it is still over priced for what you get (see points 1-4). My goal is to buy more houses and become a landlord eventually because this place is headed for serfdom in the future. I know what side I want to be on when that happens.

6. The music scene. There was a time, I suppose, when Austin was a hip place for this.  No longer. SXSW is a shit show now. Very little to do with music and more of a place where people can get priced out to see a shit show of drunks, crowds, and ""DJs."" Like how comicon was cool back in the day I guess.

**Update: People are asking if ,""can't you shit on any city this way?"" You probably can but Austin deserves it because it makes several list yearly stating how great it is:**

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/laurabegleybloom/2019/05/31/is-austin-texas-the-best-city-in-america/amp/

I am not going to post more articles because a simple google search will give you many articles going back yearly. Prior to moving back to the U.S.A., my wife suggested Austin as a city.  She knew I lived their before and used articles like the one above to talk herself and me into moving here. This is why I think it is overrated. Article after article signing it's praises.",j31nrh,"I think the biggest thing about Austin is that it's a niche city. People who are into the Austin culture will love it. So if you're super liberal and so-called 'hipster' who buys into that whole ""Keep Austin Weird"" culture, it's not overrated.(Also, good to keep in mind that this sort of culture appeals to the younger, single people.) Otherwise, Austin is so-so. This crowd will also go for SF, Seattle, Portland, Denver and other liberal cities that are more expensive than Austin is, in terms of Price to Income Ratio. Compared to Portland, real estate is cheaper and job market is not as bad. Also, summer can be brutal but you don't have to deal with prolonged lack of sunshine. People are in general very friendly and nice in Austin. I've moved to Montreal where summers are too short (not only that a lot of summer days are too cool to be considered summer weather while some summer days are just too humid), winter is oppressive to say the least, and people are not as nice or chill. Super hard to make new friends in a lot of other places in the world.",g8t5ttt
"If the issue of abortion was completely off the table for all time, it seems apparent that the Democratic party upholds the ideals and teachings of Jesus better than the Republicans.","I grew up in the bible belt and went to church through a wide array of the Christian spectrum.  My mother's family was Lutheran, though I attended Catholic masses frequently with my best friend.  My sister and I often attended the local baptist church as it was the one all of other friends usually attended and various sleepovers and activities often lead there.  My father is a devout Pentecostal.  I'm familiar with many interpretations of the teachings of Christ.

When it comes to issues of peace, truth, and charity, the Democrats have always seemed much more adherent to the attitudes the Bible conveys Jesus to teach.  Both sides have declared war pretty consistently though the war budget is usually fattened by Republicans and leaned out by Democrats.  Republicans consistently fight against programs for the poor and empower the rich.  Democrats are not known for starting the disinformation war, and seem reluctant to enter the conspiracy theory market or participate in the arms race that is campaign misinformation and misdirection as opposed to openly embracing what appears to be blatant deception.

I do not hold to Christian beliefs merely by being raised around them nor am I beholden to any party.  I do lean left but am pretty moderate otherwise.  I am much closer to the atheistic side of agnosticism, but this has always confused me.  How do the majority of Christians adhere to the Republican party solely based on the merits of their abortion stance when outwardly they are otherwise far less Christlike.

Edit:. Thanks for the input, I see the flaws in my logic regarding compulsory charity.  I still feel they can be the result of personal belief of the policy maker but see why it doesn't follow biblical teachings.  Even my over the top Pentecostal father missed that point when I asked him.",f5vr4z,"What are you thoughts on mixing cloth, lobsters and working on Sundays?",fi1bo4d
People who claim *insert musician/band here* saved my life are almost always exaggerating and statements like this trivialize suicide.,"As a big music listener, I constantly see references to certain songs ""saving"" people's lives. For example, comments on music videos on YouTube as well as Hopeless Records' series of compilations titled ""Songs that Saved My Life"". I can only imagine the majority of these claims aren't sincere / literal. 

In my opinion, statements such as this greatly downplay the seriousness of suicide and are disrespectful to genuine suicide survivors. Whilst promoting discussion around mental health is important, portraying depression and other mental illnesses as ""cool"" is problematic and should be stopped.",uc8i0l,"We’re all the hero of our own story, and many people look back at turning points in their life, ones where they were headed on a very bad path. And often, associate a song, movie, or book with what helped them make the change.

I don’t think “songs that save your life” necessarily means they were in immediate danger of suicide, maybe it is a song that gave you courage as you were moving out of an abusive home, or the book that you read over and over as you struggled in school that helped keep you going.

I have songs like that, and whenever I hear them, I feel powerful memories of that time.",i69dxwm
"most subs on Reddit are far left leaning and will shout anything down that doesn’t fit their agenda, same as their mods. This does not exclude debate subs.","Now since this is only my personal experience I am open to any input from another perspective.

It also feels like there are some subjects like gay people, transgenderism, pro-life vs. pro choice, mental health, etc. that you can’t discuss at all because people seem to get so triggered at their very sight. It even has gone to the lengths of perma bans and mods insulting me, because of simply voicing an opinion / for simply making a post.

Riders of electric bikes and scooters should have a driver license in order to use them,"I've seen so many people who just buy an e-bike or an electric scooter and think that gives them the right to instantly transition from riding on the road to riding on the sidewalk, ignoring red lights or traffic signs. Now, newer generations of electric vehicles reach some pretty high speeds (60km/h or even more than that). At that speed I think they should be allowed exclusively on the road, and that users should possess a license. 

Let's take the EU for example. We have the AM category. You're supposed to get a license like this when you ride vehicles with a max speed of less than 45km/h. Anything larger than that, you'd need at least an A1 license. As far as I know, you don't even need an AM license to ride an electric bike.  

I feel like there is a loophole in the legislation because electric bikes and scooters grew so popular so fast and were not regulated enough and people can simply buy one quite powerful vehicle and ride without knowing basic traffic rules. Even children have access to this, but as most sane people wouldn't let a child ride a motorcycle or drive a car, I feel it shouldn't be so easy for them to just hop on an electric bike and ride away like that.",dfexuq,"I can't speak for the rest of the world, but at least in Norway, electric vehicles that go beyond 20-25 km/h have to be registered and will be considered as AM I believe.",f32m7ob
We as human beings have no free will.,"So recently, I have been really intrigued upon this philosophical idea called determinism. Determinism basically entails that every single actions in our lives have been pre-determined by various factors, such as your DNA, your upbringing, your culture, or your sex. There are many levels or different types of determinism: hard determinism, soft determinism, social determinism, compatibilism, etc, with hard determinism, a concept that I personally believe, strongly advocates that every single tiny action, including what you “chose” to eat this morning, is already determined. There is a famous quote from sport physiologist Per-Olof Astrand that goes, “I am convinced that anyone interested in winning Olympic gold medals must select his or her parents very carefully.” This is just to show how we grow up, our appearances, our athletic abilities, our hobbies are already determined not by our DNA then our surrounding community. 

As I was discussing this with my friends, I see that all of them immediately show disbelief or dislike of this ideology, not because of its reasoning, but they just don’t like to think that they have zero control over their lives. However, to me, they have failed to build an argument  that shows flaws in determinism, which might be because they are new to this topic. But through my tinkering and reading, I have found that determinism is the most logical and concrete school of thought out there regarding free will that also goes with our scientific understanding.",f2lr7s,"&gt;every single actions in our lives have been pre-determined by various factors, such as your DNA, your upbringing, your culture, or your sex.

Saying Olympic gold medal winners are the best in the world is misleading for the winter Beijing Olympics.,"As I'm watching the Olympics this year I have heard on several occasions that the current world leader is unable to compete because they are out because of Covid or they are in quarantine. I think that this has tainted the Olympics naming the ""best in the world"" because competitor's are gaining an unseen advantage due to influence outside of competitors control. China has claimed that the Olympics will take place safely and I understand that catching covid is not the host countries fault but since in some events are having world champions not competing due to the host the Olympics rules with covid it makes it seem that they are ""the best in the world who were able to compete"" not the actual best in the world. I don't want to minimize the accomplishments of gold medal winners but this Olympics feels more like regular world championship competition and less like competition between the best athletes int he world. I am uninformed about athletes that did not compete due to not being vaccinated  or stuff like that but to athletes that followed all protocols and were unfortunate enough to still have a breakthrough case or similar circumstance.",so8g4g,"Nobody is the best in the world until you realize your shepherd's most important task.

Europe is not a real continent.,"Europe and Asia are really one in the same. They’re one massive continent (call it Eurasia). 

There is no geographic boundaries that separate them that make any sense. Not in the way that there is separating Eurasia from Africa, or North America from South America. 

The most popular geographical boundaries seem to be the Bosphorus Strait and the Ural Mountains. But how does a mountain range determine continental boundaries? 

It seems to be completely arbitrary. Sure, the historical justification is “cultural differences.” But there are *massive* cultural differences in Africa alone, yet we don’t consider that separate continents. Hell, there are massive cultural differences in so-called Asia, as well. You have what we would consider white people on the Eastern Mediterranean and in east Asia what we would consider “Asian.” 

To CMV, convince me that there is a compelling reason we should still consider Europe and Asia two separate continents, and not just one big continent.",sswk2r,"We create the boundary, much like the boundary between my property and the next door neighbors.

Trump's increased vote total proves White Supremacy and bigotry is broadly accepted here,"In 2016, Donald Trump's vote total was ~63 million. So far in 2020, he has received over 68 million. 

In the four years since taking over the presidency, Trump has embolded and empowered white supremacists and neonazis, while repeatedly avoiding condemning them. Just in the last few months we had a militia plan to kidnap and lynch a governor and an 18 year old murder protesters across state lines. Go back a little further and we had the Poway Synagogue shooting, the El Paso massacre, the Pitt Synagogue shooting, a deranged supporter mailing pipe bombs to Trump's ""enemies"", and the infamous ""both sides"" of the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally. 

Also, let's not ignore the violence that has occurred at the hands of ""law enforcement"" during these protests against police brutality and for black lives. Trump openly encourages violence against protesters and whomever he deems ""criminals."" And, instead of acknowledging the racism and abuse of power rampant in US policing, Trump defends them and  has on many occasions encouraged more force against so-called ""criminals"".

Perhaps most nauseating is the treatment of and rhetoric towards brown and black immigrants. Trump's ICE and DHS agencies are documented to torture immigrants, separate families (and lose the children???), Forced sterilizations on women unaware of what was happening, and destroying the sanctity of seeking asylum and a better life in the US.

It is impossible to detangle Trump's rhetoric from the violence and dehumanization of ""others"" that has festered and perpetuated under his administration. The FBI has even raised the alarm on the risk of domestic terrorists (and specifically white supremacists) in this post election period. 

Yet, somehow, more people cast a vote in support of Donald Trump this year than in 2016. The fact is that for around 70 million Americans, none of this was as important as ___________ (economy? Abortion? Taking away healthcare? Idk, you fill in the blank). I'm not implying that every single voter is a white supremacist. But, I am implying they are at the very least ignorant of the threat, and complicit in their empowerment. If you can say ""I don't support Trump's character, but I ignore it because I support X policy,"" then you are complicit in the terror and violence that white supremacists and neo Nazis pose on communities of color and religious minorities. You have consciously decided that you can ignore the vitriol and hatred that Trump has spread, and the terrorism and violence that continues to occur is an acceptable consequence for your personal gain (whatever it is you believe you gain from his presidency). 

This election should have explicitly been a condemnation of the hatred, dehumanization and violence Trump has invited. But 70 million people decided to embrace it again in pursuit of self-interest. 

The US's history of slavery, colonization, imperialism, genocide of indigenous peoples, Nazi support in the 1930s and 40s, KKK and terrorism of black communities, Jim Crow and systemic racism, anti-Islam ""patriotism"" post 2001, and the treatment of immigrants, have never been addressed by our society.

Probably because of all the crimes they're committing. 

&gt; And, instead of acknowledging the racism and abuse of power rampant in US policing, Trump defends them and has on many occasions encouraged more force against so-called ""criminals"".

Probably because it's the job of the police to arrest criminals.

That's an Obama policy.

Sanctity?

&gt;It is impossible to detangle Trump's rhetoric from the violence and dehumanization of ""others"" that has festered and perpetuated under his administration.

Is it?

&gt;I'm not implying that every single voter is a white supremacist.

Which would be dumb because Trump [raised his voter share](https://twitter.com/MattBruenig/status/1323825846365396992) among every demographic except white males this election.

&gt;But, I am implying they are at the very least ignorant of the threat, and complicit in their empowerment.

Or maybe that threat is overblown. 

&gt; If you can say ""I don't support Trump's character, but I ignore it because I support X policy,"" then you are complicit in the terror and violence that white supremacists and neo Nazis pose on communities of color and religious minorities.

Damn, a lot more complicit people of color and religious minorities this election than last one. Crazy. So much self-hatred.

Public sector unions should be abolished.,"Despite the support that unions enjoy on Reddit, they are just as corrupt as the corporations they negotiate against. Power corrupts whether that power is in the hands of a CEO commanding a million dollar company or in a union president commanding millions in union dues. Unions are often a necessary evil, not necessarily a force for good. 

For example, Jimmy Hoffa was one of the most corrupt union leaders of all time. It was his explicit goal to bring all logistics workers into the Teamsters Union so he could control the shipping of all goods within the U.S. and charge monopoly rates. This had the secondary effect of raising wages, but really his goal was to increase union dues so he could invest those dues into Las Vegas casinos run by his connections in organized crime. 

Jimmy Hoffa was a bad man, but the damage he could do was ultimately limited because if the organizations his union members worked for went out of business, his party would be over as well. This is where the dangers of public sector unions become apparent. 

Public unions, like police unions and teacher unions, have the same ability to hold their organizations hostage, but because the public sector cannot “go out of business” the damage they can do to their organizations and the tax payer is unlimited. 

Furthermore, unlike private sector unions where workers are unlikely to have any stock or say in governance, all public sector union members are able to vote in the elections governing their organizations like any other citizen. 

Public sector unions should be abolished. Union leaders are susceptible to corruption. Public sector union power is not checked by bankruptcy. Public union members have a governing stake in their organizations so unions are much less necessary.",v6yji7,"&gt;Public unions, like police unions and teacher unions, have the same ability to hold their organizations hostage, but because the public sector cannot “go out of business” the damage they can do to their organizations and the tax payer is unlimited.

Well this is just incorrect.  [Public schools can and do declare bankruptcy and close](https://www.debtfreeohio.com/bankruptcy-information/bankruptcy/can-a-public-school-district-declare-bankruptcy/).  So the idea that a teachers' union can place unlimited demands on school district and they have to be met regardless of the consequences is false.

&gt;Furthermore, unlike private sector unions where workers are unlikely to have any stock or say in governance, all public sector union members are able to vote in the elections governing their organizations like any other citizen.

The entire point of a union is to have a say in the governance of the organization.  School districts are governed by school boards, and anyone who lives in the school district can vote in the school board election.

But both unions and corporations publicly back candidates in governmental elections, so there's no real difference between a public union and a private one in that regard.",ibhxt40
Gambling should be fully legal and there's not a single good reason why not,"Gambling laws are stupid and fucking ridiculous.

Let's focus on ""The Land of The Free™"" compared to everywhere else.

The only real form of gambling in most areas is lottery, which is essentially a paper slot machine scam.

Let's look at the two scenarios:

With illegal gambling, instead of going to a public safe place to play cards like a casino, we all know that won't stop people, so they do it in secret, in possibly dangerous situations. Depending on the gambling, we've all seen movies, people can get straight up killed over it.

With Legal Gambling, it is played in safe areas with security, and if you lose, they go after you legally, not lethally.

There is **no negative effects**. It's a game. It's not hurting anyone else, fuck, it's not even hurting you. America is of the few with illegal gambling laws. Notice how the rest of the fucking world isn't imploding over fucking card games? If anything, I think it's false fucking advertisement that we claim to be ""the land of the free™"" but have these nonsense laws that literally put us below other countries in freedoms. The only thing this adds to the whole equation is actually ruining people's lives, similar to the drug situation. Oh you're **playing with fucking cards** and then **handing someone green paper**? That *totally* sounds like a reason for several years in jail, the loss of your job and life. Oh yeah, and a little tiny itty bitty thing it can add: Say you love poker and blackjack and all you want to do is go to a *real* casino. Well, you can't because you live in the middle of nowhere so I guess you're just too poor to do a thing you could literally do fucking anywhere.

They use this excuse ""it's to help gambling addicts"" well look at what a fucking shocker the outcome is, they're still out there, except they're playing government regulated almost-guaranteed-loss bullshit lottery, or they're being hunted by loan sharks.

This is something I've felt strongly about for a long time. You're good at sports? Money. You're good at video games? Money. You're good at cards? Well, if the World Poker Tournament is too far away, prison? Ffs way back in school the resource officer gave us, *children*, a lecture on why ""putting 10¢ on the table as a joke is still a federal offense"" give me a fucking break. Go to an online casino, it literally always says ***SPECIFICALLY*** ""Not eligible to residents of the United States""

*Land of the Free™* my ass

I want to see the light in this appearingly broken system. Tell me why it makes *any* sense that you can play cards on TV, you can play cards in Las Vegas, you can play cards in *most of the world*, but the average American citizen somehow doesn't deserve to.",bxixfp,"Just to clarify; the US government itself does not ban gambling. It's the state governments which ban it, of which they do to varying degrees. If you wanna gamble badly, a quick search in wiki told me that in Nevada and Lousiana only is casino style gambling legal across the state.
Perhaps one reason why so many states banned it is because of the health of the activity on average.
Alcohol drinking as mentioned is not a healthy habit by any stretch; the more you drink, the worse (there is a study saying 1 glass of wine per day is good for you but let's forget that). However, it can be assumed that most people dont overdrink and the alcohol industry makes better business, benefitting the economy especially considering the US (I'm assuming I don't live there) is a country where you pay for your own medical bills, making health problems a smaller issue for a government (the age of prohibition is  probably still fresh in the governments' mind as well). On the other hand, I'm not sure whether most gamblers don't overgamble (but I'll assume they don't) and the consequence for overgambling unlike alcohol drinking is debt, which I'd assume is much worse for an economy to deal with. I could only count on 1 hand the amount of times I've entered a gambling environment, leave alone participated, but I get the idea that the average win/lose ratio in gambling is like a videogame's average kill/death ratio at best; it stays at one since for one person to win, another (or a few) must lose, and there is a presence of exceptionals meaning that those with a high win/lose ratio must lower plenty of others' win/lose ratios keeping the average ratio at 1. From the perspective of the government, it's a business where people throw money into a pile, it gets redistributed and most participants lose some, all in the name of 'fun' just like your typical videogame. Difference being that majority suffer by losing money to a casino/few people which could've been spent on the economy better (there is a study showing that on average rich people tend to spend money less beneficially on the economy than poorer people by for example spending more on foreign imported luxury items).  When they decided on this legislation the states likely had their own statistics to muddle over but considering the best case scenario for average winners is less than half I doubt the government would typically have a good outlook on gambling centers like casinos. Hence gambling, unless it's a culture/tradition reserved for the rich (as I'd suspect in Europe for example) is actually detrimental to the economy, and in the view of other recreational habits which can be equally as addictive but with less harsh side effects on a government there is one reason for you why they might decide to ban betting (games can still be played. And people can still pay to watch others play).
I'm no expert on gambling, nor the economy, and my math could've been done wrong, so feel free to correct me wherever you can",eqa65im
"As they’re used today, the words ‘man’ and ‘woman’ have no definition","Okay, to start off, I’m talking about _gender_ rather than biological sex - not the chromosomes you’re born with (XX or XY in most cases, which denote being female or male), but the gender you identify with, whether that be man or woman. 

Now, where I get stuck is, what does it mean to be a man and what does it mean to be a woman? If it’s not (1) based on genitalia (see: trans people without dysphoria), or (2) based on levels of masculinity or femininity and gender roles (see: gender non-conforming people), then what is it based on? 

Many people will say gender is what you feel - you feel like a man or you feel like a woman. But man and woman have to have clear definitions in order for you to be able to relate to and identify with them. _So what is the definition of “man” and what is the definition of “woman”? All I see are things that gender is _not_, but nothing about what gender _is_. 

I honestly want to change my view because the concept of gender baffles me and I just want to understand it. So, I challenge you, try to define “man” and “woman” for me given what I’ve mentioned above.

EDIT: Forgot to mention that there is also an argument that pronouns do not equal gender (see: lesbians who use he/him pronouns). Again, it just muddles things further in terms of figuring out what gender identity and being a “man” or “woman” actually means.",lx8m8i,"I would like to propose to you the gender abolitionist position: The words don't have inherent meaning, and they shouldn't.

Fahrenheit is superior to Celsius when you're talking about the weather,"I obviously have no issue using Celsius in any other setting--engineering, manufacture, science, astronomy, etc. There's nothing wrong with Celsius.

But it *is* awkward when it comes to the weather aka the air temperature we experience as we go about our days on Earth.

Ideally, you want the scale of what you're measuring to match up so that it goes from 0-10 or 0-100 in most circumstances. It's convenient and easy.

Using my home as an example (midwest USA) the temperature of the outside air is almost always between 0 degrees F to 100 degrees F, depending on the season.

However, if we swap to Celsius, then that means the temperature scale is most likely...-17 degrees to 37 degrees.

That's just...awkward. No one would actually design a system so that it bottoms out or hits maximum at that value. Obviously this system ISN'T designed, so people that use C just use C everywhere, including the weather. But what I'm getting at is at the very least when it comes to the weather, I see no reason why we'd ever swap to C even though we do use it in professional settings a lot. Fahrenheit simply makes more *sense* for the weather because it scales to common air temperatures much better.

To put it another way:

* 0 degrees F = Really cold
* 100 degrees F = Really hot

* 0 degrees C = Rather cold

The star wars prequels are just as bad/good as the sequels,"For some reason, people think that the prequels are good now? That the story is good but the dialogue bad? I think the story of both prequels and sequels are utter trash, and people are looking at the prequels with rose colored glasses.

1. Anakin's bizarre development from episode 2 to 3 - he murders children without remorse in episode 2, but he's joking around cheerfully in 3? That makes literally zero sense. He shouldn't even hesitate to kill dooku after murdering those children.

2. Padme's death. WTF

3. Why would anyone entrust anakin, ""the chosen one"" to Obi wan who is new? Why wouldn't Yoda or someone take him as a padawan?

4. The clones being inducted as an army - Obi wan runs into a mysterious project that according to the makers was commissioned by a Jedi, but there is no proof of this. And then for some reason, they are inducted as a military? Without any looking into what they are?

I can go on and on but I don't think star wars is ever meant to be any sort of masterpiece and reached its peak with Empire Strikes Back",klc5n1,Here is the thing with the prequels. You are missing ALOT of character development from Anakin if you just watch the movies. I suggest you watch the Clone Wars (the animated series) for more of the development. Its also not just Anakin. Also if you just watch the movies you miss out on alot of the lore.,gh95ww8
it is entirely acceptable to discriminate on grounds of ideology.,"In another CMV i was discussing with someone about the difference between discriminating against a racist and a homosexual, their point was that both were examples of discriminating against behaviours that people don't like, my retort was that one was an ideology and the other was a state of being and weren't comparable.

However, this set a ball rolling in my head; if it's OK to discriminate against a racist and racism is an ideology should it be OK to discriminate against any ideology? This was troubling, I consider myself a liberal, I don't think discrimination is to be encouraged but logically I believe I should be able to discriminate against anyone I disagree with. If I was an employer and a job applicant came in who voted for a different party than me or had different social values, would it be OK for me to discriminate against them on those grounds. Real world examples would be discriminating against someone wearing a MAGA hat for example.

So, is discriminating against an ideology ok or do I need a better explanation for why it's OK to discriminate against a racist?",c65nhl,"At least currently, we give special discrimination protections to traits that people can't change, such as sex, race, disability, religion. That's not an unlimited protection, though. If there is some lady that is an a-hole you can absolutely fire/take action against her. She is exhibiting actions that have nothing to do with her membership in the protected sex class. I think the key is that the classifications are really broad. You can't possibly predict or judge someone based solely on their sex, race, or religion. 

Even though it's not legally protected, I don't think political alignment is a good quality to discriminate against. There are only 2 major parties in the U.S. meaning that almost half of all people vote one way or the other. To make generalizations about them at the expense of fair treatment or employment opportunities is just as harmful as refusing to hire any women because you believe X. Unlike the other protected classes, political leanings is not inherent to a person, and in fact in general people tend to switch during their lifetime based on their socioeconomic movement. But again, it is not a fair indicator of them as a person. You don't know why a certain person voted for Trump, and it could have nothing to do with racism etc. 

So in short, I don't think it's good to discriminate against generalized groups of people that are defined by something unrelated to the action you are against. So you can't discriminate against all MAGA hat wearers because you believe they could be racist, but you can take action against a specific person that is racist. I know it gets murky when symbols get associated with certain beliefs, but again I think we should avoid discriminating against groups of people and focus on the person themselves. These types of beliefs are highly influenced by a person's upbringing, experiences, and situation. 

&gt;  I consider myself a liberal, I don't think discrimination is to be encouraged but logically I believe I should be able to discriminate against anyone I disagree with. 

I think this is a problematic viewpoint. We should strive not to discriminate against anyone just because you disagree with them. Christian bakers don't agree gays should get married, but it's problematic if we let them do that. That doesn't mean unlimited tolerance, certainly we can refuse service to assholes, violent people, or people operating far outside what is socially acceptable. But we can also recognize that everyone is a little bit racist, that both sides of every contentious topic have valid beliefs, and that as long as people are not being harmful, hateful, or assholes.",es6fp31
The average person is pretty bad at formal logic and this is having terrible consequences in society,"Let me start by saying that I don't pretend to be a paragon of logic and reasoning. However I have a degree in CS and a minor in math and I earn my keep doing math (geometry mostly). That doesn't mean I know anything at all, it doesn't mean I am smart, it doesn't mean that I am an expert in any of the issues I talk about in the post, but it does mean I know how a formal logical system operates.

I often find people on the internet arguing with full confidence about stuff they lack proper understanding of.

Take this post as an example:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/e18eza/an_infinite_number_of_monkeys_mashing_randomly/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Where a lot of people were claiming ""that's not how infinity works"".

In that post I started arguing with multiple people as to why it is absolutely true (with 100% certainty) that infinite monkeys would produce all of Shakespeare's works at least once.

This is something that can be mathematically proven and I even gave the proof. Yet people kept arguing, one of them even resorted to name calling and stoped responding to the thread all together.

Now this is in terms of a problem that is purely theoretical and well defined, thus the realm of pure logic, and people still argued for a point that was demonstrably wrong even after being shown the proof.

This is just a silly example (that exasperates me a bit) but it's a symptom of a much bigger issue. Which is the lack of logical thinking that I refer to in the title.

Take another case. I constantly see people in Reddit claiming that social issues will be fully solved by redistribution of wealth.

The GDP per capita in the US is about 60k dollars a year. So that's what everyone would earn if we perfectly redistributed earnings equally among everyone. 

Problems of loss due to money transfer and differences in need aside, the ""happy point of happiness"" (when money and happiness stop being correlated) is about 78k USD. That means that even in theory we would be short 18k a year per person. So even in Theory we would need more than just wealth the distribution to solve social issues. 

(The above is not an argument against wealth redistribution, it's an argument against the idea that we can just redistribute wealth and that's enough, which it clearly isn't).

Another example is the dogmatism about not eating meat at all in any shape way or form to ""not benefit from suffering"". Without denying all the environmental issues that the meat industry poses, and assuming that most people can live a healthy life eating only plant based foods, we still have issues taking that to the extreme.

Problems include:
Cats are strict carnivores, do we stop making catfood? Do we release cats into the wild potentially harming ecosystems?

Similar argument for dogs which are mostly carnivores.

What about animal populations that get out of control? As it happens with deers and boars and other animals? And in a similar vein, what about the animals we torture for scientific data, which is critical to developing medicines...

I have argued with people that legitimately think it would be better to live in a world where we never harm animals intentionally, and just from the above you can see the argument is problematic.

(Again the point of the above is not whether or not reducing animal harm is good or bad, but that the non nuanced position ""we should never harm animals for our benefit"" which I have seen some people argue for, has lots of issues).

I could keep going with other social and environmental issues. But so often I find people that have made their minds about a topic without even considering the full extent of the logical implications of the position. And when you try to point out that either in theory or in practice that idea has shortcomings or is flat out wrong, they usually disengage from the conversation.

Living in a democracy this terrifies me. If you can't even talk to people about the logical and pragmatic limits of their ideas we can't make effective laws nor policies. And if people are unwilling to listen to criticism because it comes from ""the other side"" or ""the enemy"". All that we have left is see either social conflict or the eventual disasters that will ensue due to implementation of poorly thought policies, as we have already seen before.

EDIT:

Lots of people are still trying to argue the monkeys and typewriters. 

Here's the proof:

Assumptions I will make: 

I have infinite monkeys, the monkeys are in rooms with typewriters, the typewriters are colorful and make noises, each key produces a different noise, keeping the monkey entertained such that every 5 seconds they will type at least one character.

Consequences:

For any key K there exists a probability p of that key being typed. Without loss of generality, assume that the probability is the same for all keys (the proof remains the same without this assumption, I would just have to type a long ass formula using summations and products).

Given a finite sequence of N characters, the probability of that sequence being typed once is (p)^N

On M trials, the probability of NOT typing that sequence is  (1-p^N )^M

The limit of the above expression as M goes to infinity is 0, in other words, as M approaches infinity, the probability of typing the sequence approaches 1.",e27faz,"I'm not so sure. I would guess that, on average, people have a pretty good intuition about the rules of logic. Most folks can understand that just because all penguins are birds, that doesn't mean that all birds are penguins, even if they wouldn't know to call that affirming the consequent. Anyone knows that if parking isn't allowed on Mondays, and today is Monday, then there's no parking allowed (though they may not know the term *modus ponens*).

People, generally, have logical beliefs. They hold various assumptions and connect premises to conclusions. They may not have *correct* beliefs, and may often not have thought very often about their assumptions. But truly *illogical* thinking would be incoherent and a symptom of a serious mental illness rather than a feature of everyday life.

But that's everyday, ordinary logic. *Formal* logic, on the other hand, is something different. Is both a specialized tool and a rhetorical style. As a tool, it's very useful in some contexts, like computer programming or the law or academic philosophy. As a rhetorical style, I've mostly seen it wielded a silencing and bullying tactic. It's a way of avoiding engaging with what a person believes, and forcing them to play a particular game.

It's trivially easy to create a sound construction, with the trappings for formal logic, for almost any position a person is likely to hold. Sixteen year olds on high school debate teams do it every day. The ability to frame your position in this style isn't--to my eye--indicative of that position being right.

So engage with people on their own terms. If they're not following you down the formal logic hole, try to understand them in another way.",f8uegko
Conservative Evangelicals have sold out for the GOP. What they “stand for” and what they actually support are no longer the same.,"As someone who grew up in the Bible Belt, it seems except for the single issue of abortion (which is a choice, and never impacts someone unless they choose to make that choice), the actions by the GOP go against the virtues they preach.

Republicans will hate Biden no matter what he does...,"I believe Republicans will hate Biden no matter what.

The reason I believe this is because it seems like Trump supporters are genuinely part of a cult. Even when Trump does something against their own principles, like a bum stock ban or raising the deficit significantly for example, he doesn't face even an iota of criticism from his own side. Recently, Trump supporters are even calling to abandon Fox News and move on to more right-wing networks like OAN, or get Trump and Tucker Carlson their own shows. This is all because Fox News refuses to irresponsibly platform election disinformation.

The attitude that non-violent sexual assault happens rarely to men is incorrect and only backed up statistically because men don’t report it,"Non-violent sexual assault happens to men all the time and goes unreported so stats on the issue are incorrect.

I’m sick of reading that sexual assault happens to women only. Or that it’s “rare” for it to happen to men.

If a man is slapped on the arse people around laugh at it. Including usually the man’s friends.

If this happens to a woman in todays society people will kick off.

I’m a firefighter. I get told to “show us your hose” all the time. And other stuff that would go under “catcalling” and it’s laughed at by everyone.

I’ve had a woman grab me from behind saying she wanted to feel my chest. Infront of 3 co workers. Everyone laughed when we got outside. And then we joked about how if I was a woman we would have put a note on her property as “dangerous to firefighters” 

I’ve got countless other examples going back to when I was young doing my first jobs. This hasn’t just happened to be in my current job. I’m sure most men do too. 

I’m not saying it’s equal. I’m saying it happens to men all the time. But we have to accept it. Laugh about it. It’s not an issue when it’s happening to a man.

"The anti-science that is rampant today is largely due to people using appeal to authority as an argument and not actually citing studies, data, and research.","In the early to mid 2000s I saw the early stages of the rampant anti-science movement we have today emerging from the likes of Alex Jones. 

One friend of mine had begun muttering some nonsense about global warming being a hoax and citing studies he took directly off one of Alex Jones' pages so I invited my meteorologist friend to his house for a discussion.  During the discussion the meteorologist went through all of the data cited and gave his counterpoints with data.  Surprisingly he didn't necessarily dismiss all of the ""denial"" data but gave his scientific perspective on it. At the end he managed to change the ""deniers"" perspective and they now not only act consciously in the world but also share the information at their disposal.

Fast forward to 2014 and my son was about to be born amidst all of the anti-vaxx hype.  My sister in law was very anti-vaxx and would give my wife and I countless studies to read.  I remembering spending many many hours trying to find just one good article actually debunking the anti-vaxx movement and have very little if any success. Again I called on a friend to supply data, this time my friends sister who is an OB-GYN. Again they took out charts and moved systematically through research both debunking and explaining some of the anti-vaxx points.  Needless to say my kids are vaccinated but unfortunately most people don't have close and personal access to people they trust that have information like this.

The significant problem is actually getting the real information.  Everywhere I looked whether it was reddit, or articles from the New York Times or any publication the argument always ended up at ""Trust science or you are both a moron and an asshole"".  This sentiment has actually caused my meteorologist friend to step out of his position in the academic world because he thinks people should be *encouraged to question everything* and then given the data in the best way possible in order to actually proliferate science.  His belief, and mine now too, is that if your argument ever comes down to ""Trust us(or 'them') we are experts"" than you are as anti science as an anti vaxxer.",gh27zp,"While it is true that experts in their respective fields should step out to educate the masses, it is a feat that is simply not achievable. There is no incentive for such experts to step out of their academic position to deconstruct science for the layperson. So, who fills in this gap? Who takes on the responsibility of educating the public about science? I think that the government should be responsible. The government should be responsible in providing objective science available and accessible for the average person. Science directly impacts our quality of life, think, the use of vaccines. So, the government should be expected to provide objective viewpoints regarding controversial issues in science directly concerning our quality of life. 

However, a problem arises when the people in political authority blatantly reject the truth for reasons such as for the good of the economy or for good press etc. When the government refers to falsehoods, misinformation and lies as ‘alternative facts’, it gives people rejecting science leverage as they believe that there is space in the room for an opposing argument to be made, even though science has been verified to be fact through peer-reviewed journals, meta-analyses and what have you not. 

Furthermore, when people in political authority reject the facts, people may lose the faith they have in authority and so, they grasp onto accessible science often containing partial and cherry-picked data, and start believing incorrect things.

Ultimately, I think the problem is a much bigger one. People can be free to believe what they want. However, their beliefs should not infringe on the well-being of others. This is the case for vaccines. One person rejecting a vaccine can threaten many immunocompromised people. When the statistical odds of the negative effects of vaccines are so low and when the negative effects of vaccines are much less severe than what that vaccine wards against, e.g. polio or tetanus, I personally think that it is reasonable for nationwide vaccination to be employed.

So, all in all, the government should make science accessible to the layperson and not convolute any political agenda they have with facts. To do this, the government can employ experts from respective areas to provide objective data and analysis for science that directly impact our health and quality of life.",fq8aonv

"You should be allowed to protect your property with lethal force, just like you would with your person.","If a person invades your home, business or private property, if you warn them about your willingness to use lethal force and they ignore that warning, you have every right to use lethal force.

You are not obligated to leave your property if it is under threat. Even if you have a means to leave your property safely, you should have the right to remain if you decide to. It is not necessarily a smart choice, but it is a morally acceptable action. You should be able to treat your property as how you would treat your person in a confrontation.

I do not believe this to be unlimited. You cannot just use lethal force on a person fleeing e.g. stealing your vehicle, or if they are taking an item. Likewise, lethal force without warning (shooting a person who might have just been mistaken) is unacceptable.

Only if a person invades your property and you vocalise that they are not welcome and you are willing to use lethal force, and they ignore this warning, then they surrender their right to safety.

I believe it’s a woman right to chose. However, it bothers me when some pro-lifers claim that it is okay to be in support of inhumane things that are actually not pro-life at all.

"when you call for censorship of ‘hate speech’, you’re assuming one of two things: you’re SO much smarter than everyone else that you need to protect their fragile little minds from becoming Nazis, or you yourself are one right-wing article away from becoming a Nazi yourself.","Basically the title. I put “hate speech” in quotation marks because whatever constitutes hate speech is truly based on personal opinion. It’s no surprise either, considering that you can claim just about anything has the *potential* to lead to violence. 

Some people think a comedian making off-colour jokes will lead to hate and violence against the joked-about group. Some people think shouting “Let’s kill the Jews!” to an angry mob outside a synagogue should be protected speech. So yes, between those two ridiculous extremes, whatever constitutes “hate speech” is personal opinion, but that’s not what today’s CMV is about. Today’s CMV is about how pro-censorship people view the general public, and how they look at the average person. 

I’m looking for an alternative explanation to this: anyone—*anyone*—who calls for a blanket ban on what they call “hate speech” is assuming one of two things. 

**Scenario A: The Enlightened One**

The first type of person is typically a self-righteous person who won’t admit to themselves they’re calling for censorship more to make themselves feel good than to solve actual problems. They assume that, outside of their circle, the world is full of complete *idiots* who are helplessly vulnerable to extremist propaganda. “Without me”, the enlightened one thinks, “these people would fall into fascism in a matter of days. I have to restrict their access to propaganda, so that hate speech never reaches their precious little ears and corrupts their small minds. And I’d better act quickly, too, because all it would take is one racist joke to send these poor souls into a shooting spree.” 

(I may be exaggerating the self-righteousness a little due to being utterly fed up with these people, but I got the point across. This is what the pro-censorship people assume in scenario A). 

**Scenario B: The Borderline Nazi** 

 The second type of pro-censorship person is probably more rare, but is an alternative explanation to why people call for (what they deem) hate speech to be banned. 

This person is more humble, more open-minded and doesn’t assume they’re much smarter and superior than the average person. They have the best interests of the public at heart, and aren’t as interested in virtue-signalling as much as type A. 

However, type B’s see themselves as *very* susceptible to hateful ideas. They live in constant fear of being influenced by white supremacists and bigots. They think, more humbly, that most people are just like them—which includes how vulnerable they are to being influenced by hateful ideas. “And so—“ type B says to themselves, “we need to censor these hateful ideas before we have hundreds of millions of Nazis marching across the cities”. 

———————————————————

I understand that people don’t want neo-Nazis to host TV shows about how great an ethno-state would be, or that we should deport people simply because of their skin colour. I understand that Christian bloggers encouraging discrimination against gay people to “teach them a lesson” have no place in a civil society. And I’m not belittling the hardships suffered by any kind of social minorities because of the things hateful people were allowed to say. 

And yet, I still understand that (again, since it’s *opinion based*), no human being on the planet is qualified enough to draw the line where “protected speech” ends and “hate speech” begins. As an alternative to legal censorship, I advocate natural censorship. (E.G, the vast majority of the population aren’t Nazis, and find Nazi ideology abhorrent. I defend social media platforms’ right to implement a “downvote” button so that the overwhelming majority shouts down Nazism, and I defend news station’s right to refuse to host a show glorifying extremism. I do *not* defend governments making laws to mandate such things). 
 
Also, (this part really, *really* shouldn’t be necessary, but this is reddit) I’m not defending Nazis or the alt-right. I find it sad to have to point out that I’m part Jewish and lean heavily left, but I have to throw that in every single time I defend someone else’s right to express their ideas, especially if those ideas are terrible. 

All that said, change my view, I’m open to suggestions.",gahqji,"my understanding of the definition of 'hate speech' is that it's more specific than just 'what may cause harm'.

From what I've heard, hate speech is speech specifically DESIGNED to incite hatred.

Now you do have a point that the line to be drawn is pretty blurry thanks to subjective opinion, but quite a few things like spouting 'Gas the jews' or 'burn the witch!', consciously spreading inflammatory bullshit, consciously promoting negative unfounded stereotypes etc. are undoubtedly 'hate speech' which, I think we can all agree, the world is better without.

I know this isn't a part of your view you want changed, but I just wanted to note that.

So as for your actual view, to change it I just need to show there's possibly at least a third option right?

Well how about the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis?

A combo of 2 ideas which essentially says 'the specific words we use to define or describe things influence what we think of said things'.

e.g whether you like it or not, if the name you most often use for a member of the police department is 'policeman' the connotations of the word (it's got 'man' in it) you're more inclined to think that members of police departments are men. The damage is small, but you still have to invest resources to undo that damage, if you even identify it that is.

This is usually given as an argument for political correctness: the use of language to avoid discrimination. I.e 'senior persons' instead of 'elderly' or 'coloured people' instead of 'blacks'.

This is with the idea being, that if we replace words with negative connotations with words of neutral ones, society's thoughts won't be so negative. Remove discriminatory words, and you help to remove discrimination.

That serves as a perfect excuse to ban a lot of hate speech. Once any word begins to take on a negative connotation in a group, there is the justification to discourage it in the name of political correctness.

And why? To help build a better, more open society for everyone. Because no matter who you are, how smart you are, 'sticks and stones may break my bones but words shall never hurt me' is complete bullshit.

Also, as someone else helpfully pointed out, it's kinda hard for a person to feel at home when on a regular basis there's a public event telling you to fuck off. So there's another reason to ban hate speech.",fozy2dw
The current core classes and the curriculum in high school is a waste/inefficient use of time,"In high schools, instead of taking science class, why not have an advanced researching class so that you can learn all the equivalent information on your own when you need to? Not everyone will benefit from learning science if they are not personally interested about it. Same with history, you can still be a kind and a productive member of communities with making six figures and more without learning about it. History classes arent necessary, but rather fundamental skills such as preparing to take on responsibilities as an adult, researching, organizing and expressing information, and more. Google shapes the world today, and I think that it’s legitimate if we also kind of shape our curriculums based off of it. It’s not like the probability of google shutting down tomorrow is very high.

It would be better if in these skills classes, the assignments were project based, for example: You are supposed to research about a certain topic deeply enough and present it to the class, and the topic can be whatever you want it to be. There are criterias for how deep of each information you need to research and present. Choosing the topics you want to study would motivate the students, and focusing more solely on these skills would be more helpful than learning about let’s say basic biology. You could probably learn the basic biology of an years worth of curriculum 5x faster if you had solid grounds on skills of learning itself. 

As certain classes are about memorizing information and taking an exam right afterwards, I cannot see how this can help a bunch. Memorizing information is a useful skill, but memorizing a topic uninteresting for a short period of time and forgetting it right afterwards does not feel like learning. Every assignment should be more project based, and exams should only exist when it is about very important core concepts and principles. Memorizing random facts about WW1 and forgetting them afterwards isn’t going to help that much for students outside the field of history, even if they don’t forget the facts that they learned right afterwards.

The other classes should all be electives that the students can choose from, which ranges from the current core classes to all other electives. This would motivate the students and make them feel that their time is much more productive, while also giving students with more sense of majors and their future a massive boost. As for students who don’t know what they are interested in, the above core skills plus electives of their interest cannot hurt more than the current system.

This way, wouldn’t it be a much more encouraging and a productive way of preparing all students? Very good skills in researching and organizing info would be a better way of preparing for a variety of fields, other than to just memorize random information from the questionable “core” subjects. Plus, I don’t get why a lot of curriculums have programming/computer science class as an elective. I think that soon enough knowing at least some info about computers, the very own technology that shapes the current world, would be as much or more useful than learning about let’s say Spanish. Why learn another language, if we can get software engineers who can make very advanced translators and etc that reduce the use of being a bilingual?

I do understand that my arguments are prejudiced, but it is just that 80% of the school feels like a complete waste of time as an almost all A+ student.",n7z06j,"There are definitely issues with the curriculum (in the UK anyway). I agree, memorising information for a test is generally pointless and it doesn't reflect real world applications. There should definitely be lessons on finding and assessing information too, especially in our tech heavy world.

In terms of CMV...

Using science classes as an example for this. Everyone needs to learn about science. Why are there so many antivaxxers, climate change deniers and evolution deniers? Science is needed to educate people about these serious issues (evolution not really an issue in the same way but it explains things likes covid mutations). If people understood science the world would work so much better.

Another argument goes... we should teach kids about taxes etc, something useful! I'm an adult and don't really care about taxes, I would not have cared about them as a kid. 

Learning languages is valuable. The world is connected to high heaven, there have been several opportunities in my life where knowing another language would have been exceptionally beneficial.

History is important to learn. Mistakes have been made throughout history, we should learn and not repeat them. We clearly didn't learn much from the Spanish flu pandemic, could have saved millions. Some countries learned from the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s and did very well in the fight against covid.

It's easy to cherry pick bad parts of a curriculum but having intelligent and well rounded people that can then go on to specialise into what they find interesting is a pretty decent system. It also gives people the chance to try new things and find what they like.",gxflb0z
Systemic racism is pretty much gone in the west and that is part of why it is so hard to tackle racism now.,"Racism used to be obvious and blatant, enacted systematically at the govornment level and private level to disadvantage minorities in very clear ways. Laws that said only whites could vote, laws against italians in the US, various private companies that banned X or Y minority, they are endless. 

These systemic rules are gone, thank goodness, most countries have protections in place so it is illegal in most places to have such rules. That said racism is not gone. 

Progress was easier to acheive when it was clear who was being racist because they had it in black and white who they didnt like and we could tackle it much easier. now what we have is individals and members of groups who are racist who individually discriminate against minorities, its hard to prove when it isnt overt. 

Im not at all saying that racism is ok when not overt or that we shouldnt try and make a more fair equal society but i am simply pointing out that racism is, for the most part, an issue of bigoted people, rather than systems with bigoted rules.",ng9341,[here’s a whole google doc that has MANY peer reviewed papers in it that show the effects racism still have today.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ido70LgXsEhxcnyXE7RVS0wYJZc6aeVTpujCUPQgTrE/mobilebasic) It also has a few extra research papers that talk about other topics.

"The cops who killed Breonna Taylor are incompetent oafs, but not racist ones.","Please please change my view. I get it that some deaths protested by BLM were clearly made with racist intentions, Chauvin had multiple reports of him treating minorities worse, the men who lynched Ahmaud Arbery called him the n-word multiple times while he layed dying, but I’m not so sure about Breonna Taylor. Breonna and her boyfriend were just laying in bed when three undercover officers dressed in plainclothes barged into their house apparently without announcing themselves (as alleged by Taylor’s neighbors). From there, Taylor’s boyfriend opened fire on the men he thought were intruders and they returned fire, mortally wounding Breonna. That’s obviously sickening, but why is it being condemned around as an act of racism instead of an act of sheer incompetency, which it clearly was? I think the cops who killed Taylor should be imprisoned, and I ultimately agree to protest to prevent an incident like this from happening again... but racism? Please, change my view. I’m still relatively new into looking at social justice, my household is quite conservative and we’ve always supported the police (which I don’t anymore) so excuse any accidental ignorance which I grew up with.",m6ixud,It’s difficult to say what influence race played in Breonna’s killing. If she and her boyfriend were white would the cops have gotten a no knock warrant? Would they have even been investigated for drugs?

Two States Policy is Dead for Israel and Hamas,"Majority of the Palestinians want to get the entire former land of Palestine back to the Palestinians, and get all their refugees back.

Majority of the Palestinians also reject the ""Two State"" solution.

They want the ""one"" state of Palestine re-instated.

What will happen to the 7 million Jews who are now in Israel is not clear under this demand.

Majority of the Israeli Jews , on the other hand, support annexing the entire land of former Palestine under Israeli rule, as a Jewish state.

Most Israelies now oppose the Two State Solution also, fully knowing that whatever little land they are leaving behind for Palestinians  is not at all viable for building a state.

What happens to the 7 million Palestinians inside such  a Jewish state, without democratic rights or equal protection of law is an inconvenient question that the Israelies are OK leaving unaswered for now.

As you can see, both the majorities from two sides are ignoring reality. 72 years is a long time and whatever happened during these seven decades, rightly or wrongly, are now reality, and they are here to stay. 

Seven decades of reality has consequences.

Neither of these two parties can simply ignore what happens to the other 7 million people for the long run, even when one feels that they are the victim of the other.

Ultimately the 7 + 7 million Jews and Palestinians will have to live side by side , as equal citizens  of either just One or Two states, with equal rights. 

It is most likely going to be just One state , where the Palestinians may not be able to live alone, but they will be the demographic majority. 

Palestinians, therefore, have a lot to gain by asking for such a One State Solution with democracy, where they get equal rights as equal citizens , as the majority.

International Community should now focus on a one-state solution, more like China and Hong Kong.",nh5z5d,That’s not true. According to most estimates and depending on how you ask the question 55-75% of either of the countries want a two state solution.,gyuzfkw
Eastern Europeans are not white. It's unfair to label us the same as native French or Americans whose counties profited from colonialism and racist ideology. Slavs need to be recognised as separate and underprivileged.,"Throwoway account, because I've gathered it's a very taboo issue.

**Main point.** We don't have the same privilege as French, Germans or Americans, because our history is completely different. We never occupied other countries, we were occupied and had to fight for independence as recently as the 90s. We never had slaves, we were considered slaves, most recently by Hitler. Even before that by Westerners, even the word *slave* comes from *slav*. We never colonised and profited from other cultures. And finally, up until the fall of the Soviet Union, we were even called 2nd World to mark the difference, but now we are expected to behave like accomplished democracies and advanced economies, just because of our skin colour. We didn't build our power or freedom on the backs of Africans and Asians. Even for the racial purists out there, our genetic makeup and linguistic roots are different to those of the West. Putting us in the same basket labeled *white* is unjust and leads to our counties falling further and further into Russia's authoritarian grasp, as we are equalised with the privileged and ridiculed if we try to fight that. Our difference should be recognised. It's also divisive for all people who have been oppressed.



**More background.** I'm from Poland and moved to the UK couple of years ago for uni and stayed, hoping to get my citizenship soon. I love more liberal culture, diversity and progressive laws. That was especially important for me as a gay person. Even though there's plenty of things I disagree with, I hope to stay and raise my kids here, while also helping my new country improve.

One of the things that really bother me is how racially divided the West is. We Slavs, struggle with the sensitivities, because our countries have no racial minorities. We have no history of race interactions, except for few Asian migrants in the recent decades and Jews before 2nd World War. But nothing like slavery or colonialism, where one culture systematically oppressed and dehumanised another.

Despite many massive differences, we are not recognised in the public discourse or in diversity laws. Whenever I had to fill the forms about race I felt extremely uncomfortable being given ""White other"" at best. *White other* means I could be from France or US, countries which grew rich largely thanks to colonialism, whose poor literally travel to our countries to party, because they're so cheap to them. Even Irish (with their difficult history) are sometimes recognised, but Slavics being one the largest minorities are not.

Very few of us can express this discomfort and I spoke to many. Most just go along with the right wing propaganda about the snowflakes and pretend there's no racial issues or become racist themselves fighting against BAME. Instead of trying to get recognised and educate others. Then those ideas are transplanted back to our countries in the eastern Europe, what leads to backward policies and general ""everything Western is bad"" attitude. No surprise, we were mistreated by cultures that supposedly believe in equality and freedom. 

If we all care about European Union, fairness and freedom we all need to do something about it and just recognise Slav =/= white.

------

**EDIT:** While I haven't changed my mind as such, there's few things that were pointed out to me and I really appreciate them.

1. Russia. All those who said Russia disproves my point are right. This country colonised, oppressed and had slaves. I made an assumption and didn't define what I mean by Eastern European countries. I mean those between Germany and Russia, between Baltic sea and Greece. Most of them gained independence after the 1st World War, once German, Austrian, Russian and Ottoman empires collapsed. Slavic is also not the best term, because it includes Hungarians and Baltic people. Better term would probably be Central European. 

2. Questionable terms: *privilege*, *race* and *white*. These are indeed a bit dated and again, I haven't fully defined that on top of traditional pseudoscientific and visual characteristics I ask for differentiation based cultural circles created due to Cold War. However I realised that using term *white* is misleading. And ""white privilege"" especially is an American term, which doesn't work the same way in the UK.",gnw8j7,Race is a stupid idea to begin with.

"It’s my Body My Choice applies to abortion, but not Covid Vaccine because of how scientific research shows the medical affects of both. You cannot compare the two","I get why people bring up why wasn’t “it’s my body my choice” applied to covid vaccine because people lost their jobs, couldn’t travel or go places if they didn’t want to get the vaccine. The difference though comes down to how it affects the person’s health as well as controversy. 

Technically both issues involve someone making a choice for their body. If abortion is illegal someone can choose to still have an abortion, but in a possibly unsafe way causing them medical and body harm. Not taking the vaccine is still a choice, which results in a loss of job and freedom to go about certain places and to most scientific research suggests putting you at a greater risk of bad symptoms of covid-19. 

The research shows that when abortions become illegal women are more likely to have abortions done in a unsafe way and vaccines save lives and prevent serious illness. With abortions, there is the controversial issue on whether or not murdering a fetus is ok and at what point is it ok or is always not ok. Is a fetus a life essentially. Because everyone has their own opinion on it I think it should be a choice for each to make, but it’s understandable why the debate because of how controversial the topic is. With covid vaccines there is no controversial reason to not take it other than propoganda out there or being scared of medical consequences that have been proven to be less risk than facing serious illness of covid. 

Therefore, no one should be comparing the two.",ukdis4,"Let me just say this about the vaccine, initially the thought was that if your vaccinated you can’t get it spread covid. When that turned out to be not true, you had the government and business forcing you to inject something that could kill you for the sole purpose of protecting you. That is not bodily autonomy, as is the government suggesting you can’t have a medical procedure based on their views of the procedure. If you have ever said my body my choice you can’t be for mandating vaccines.",i7od9hq

France is bankrupt. Spain is bankrupt and has a huge unemployment issue.

""Tax his networth, his wealth"" you might say. With a wealth tax what will he have to do to get the money to pay it? ""Sell his assets"" you might say. Selling off a large amount of Amazon stock for cash money to pay the tax, will do what? It will devalue all other Amazon stock.

Amazon must be destroyed,"[https://thetransmetropolitanreview.wordpress.com/2019/06/06/destroy-amazon-an-update-on-the-tech-dystopia/](https://thetransmetropolitanreview.wordpress.com/2019/06/06/destroy-amazon-an-update-on-the-tech-dystopia/)

&amp;#x200B;

 Shortly after this disgusting conference in Washington DC, two anonymous Amazon corporate employees contacted Reuters and [revealed Amazon’s secret plans](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-automation-exclusive/exclusive-amazon-rolls-out-machines-that-pack-orders-and-replace-jobs-idUKKCN1SJ0X1)  to robotisize its fulfillment centers. According to these anonymous  sources, Amazon has been installing boxing-machines that package  commodities five time faster than a human. While the initial job losses  in the US would be less than 2,000, the sources claimed that Amazon  plans to vastly increase the number of robots. It’s unclear why these  corporate employees leaked this information, but the announcement came  less than two weeks after Amazon claimed full-automation was at least a  decade away. In a panic, Amazon [made a promise that same day](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/13/amazon-offers-employees-10k-and-3-months-pay-to-start-their-own-delivery-businesses/)  to give $10,000 dollars to any of its warehouse employees who wanted to  quit, but only if they pledged to start their own delivery company.  With the leaked information now revealing that thousands would soon lose  their jobs, Amazon had no choice but [to dangle the promise of another job](https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-delivery-paying-employees-to-quit/),  this time delivering Amazon packages rather than sorting and boxing  them. Instead of depending on the US Postal Service, UPS, or FedEX, the  company now wants thousands of small contractors to hustle back and  forth from the Amazon fulfillment centers.",bxsmwr,So Amazon wants to be more efficient as a business...those monsters!,eq9he8u
Countries’ constitutions should be reviewed regularly by nation-wide referendum,"With the notable exception of religious texts, a country's constitution is likely the most consequential document in most people's lives. This is because it directly determines what rights you are afforded, what extent these can be limited, and how many aspects of your day-to-day life will be regulated as all laws ultimately must align with the spirit of the constitution. 

For the vast majority of countries, this text is not looked at again for review until some political unrest takes place e.g. revolutions, major public opposition, or a sweeping change in government.

I have four reasons why I think this is not best for a healthy democracy:

1.	**Political contexts change over time** \- The US Constitution was drafted when slavery was legal and women could not vote among other things which would be untenable even to most right-wing individuals. Now while I accept that these individual provisions (and others) have been amended over time, it is simply indicative of the *spirit* of the constitution as a whole. The values, perspectives and rationale of the authors of the constitution is simply not in tune with the fundamental principles that vast majority of people now hold. The reason I bring this up is that all the provisions of the constitution which may have not been amended still have to be read and interpreted in that spirit by lawmakers and courts. So although not every provision will be bluntly untenable, key parts of it may be problematic in the same sense. 
2.	**Current methods of adapting the constitution are inefficient** \- Changes to the constitution through amendments in the past have required a lot of political capital and public uprising. Even when it was clear that the national mood was against certain provisions of the constitution, law-makers would usually require a lot of pressure to coerce them to enact changes which may be unfavourable with their key stakeholders and donors. Furthermore, the current trend where a lot of votes in Congress are along party lines means that political heavyweights may shift the balance of power and end up controlling half of the lawmakers. 
3.	**Direct representation in law-making is key** \- While direct access to law-making by referendum is by no means practical for all legislation, it is important when it comes to the constitution given that it is the one document that sets that tone for the country's legislative direction and a symbol of nation-wide values. Direct representation eliminates the systemic problems of lobby-interests overshadowing voters, pressure to vote along party lines despite constituents' views, and general misrepresentation of constituents' view by politicians intentionally or by simply not being in touch
4.	**New challenges require new solutions** \- When the US Constitution was drafted in in the 18th century, it is clear they have a set of challenges in mind like strengthening the Union, keeping government power at bay (shell shock from the revolution) and protecting the prosperity of agrarian land-owners. I do not think it is reasonable to extrapolate those principles to modern-day challenges like cyber-security, climate change, widening inequality. So when lawmakers have to make laws on these issues while attempting to carry out the ideas of the authors of the constitutions, they unblameworthily (is that a word?) grasp at straws resulting in wasted weeks and dollars in Congress arguing merits of high priority policies without a definitive guiding principle. 

So overall, I just think that the guiding principles of an entire nation shouldn't be left to the century-old ideologies of politicians and should rather continue to reflect present-day values and priorities. I think key issues such as lobbying, healthcare, gun-rights, and broadening inequalities may be resolved easier if these fundamentals were revisited (irrespective of what conclusions are reached on those issues).

P.S. The regularity can be debated but I had every 10-15 years in mind",lofafx,So I can publish a book or a movie and it is legal now but can be made unconstitutional next year because it is considered hate speech or porn? Do we burn all the newly illegal books?,go5thtf
A 9 year old child cannot be tried for murder.,"Currently in Illinois, a 9 year old child has been charged with arson and murder.  

At the arraignment [there was a plea colloquy which would be comical if it were not so tragic](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-illinois-9-year-old-boy-murder-charges-20191021-ddhtxpjvjvhzxflezydaq43z6y-story.html) with the judge trying to explain terms like ""allege"" and ""arson.""

Criminal guilt requires that the defendant have sufficient capacity to understand that their actions are wrong and unlawful. A young child does not have that capacity, and therefore cannot be guilty of a crime.

While the events that transpired are tragic, criminally trying a 9 year old boy is a travesty and cannot accord with any system of justice that requires a guilty mental state to find one guilty of a serious crime.",dlsene,"I'd be wary of how we punish said crimes if the 9 year old is guilty, but I don't see why we can't try him. Sure, he is ignorant of the court precedings, but he is not ignorant of his crime. Any 9 year old understands that murder is wrong. Most of the US population is ignorant of the court system. Just because this 9 year old is more ignorant than others does not mean that he does not understand his crime, even if he does not understand how he will be tried for that crime. Not to mention, even if he was ignorant about murder being a crime/wrong (a very big if), being ignorant does not excuse anyone of a crime, particularly when it is a crime of this caliber. If the kid jaywalked, it would be one thing. But he took another human life.",f4u9u7x
I feel a moral obligation to go and volunteer in Ukraine.,"Something about watching this conflict unfold in front of the whole world, makes me feel guilty for laying in bed at night.

I don't think it's racist to be disgusted at other cultures eating animals we keep as pets,"All over my social media I have been seeing how it is supposedly racist to eat meat and then be disgusted at people eating dogs, cats, whatever other animals we keep as pets. 

Tweets for example:

* ""*how dare they eat cats i love cats \*proceeds to bite into hamburger whose meat was the product of torturing a cow for its entire life before slaughtering it at the point in which its flesh is considered most succulent\**""

There are religions that view certain animals as sacred. Totally fine. Also totally fine if they think I am disgusting for eating a steak.

There is nothing after death.,"Unfortunately considering all the data at hand it seems highly likely that there is nothing after death. My closest friend had actually revealed to me after I asked on one of our group chats that he does not think there is an afterlife, I also think along the same lines but I am Christian so the line of thinking, my state of mind and the dissonance therefore produced is quite a thing to behold. 

I would just say, to most people, that it is unfortunately highly unlikely that even if you did suppose that a form of existence or space of consciousness existed post death for conscious beings it is extremely improbable that it would be impermeable or isolated/insulated from this reality/plane of existence. 

Also considering the fact that consciousness itself is lately being revealed to be a collection of fluid/rigid sets of states stimulated and frozen and so on by electrons and other bio-chemical process, all merely a chance product of evolution, it is very much possible that our existence and actions hold no more significance than the muted existence of trees. By this I mean a tree might live hundreds of years becoming a living marvel of existential significance even to beings on a higher plane of existence than itself (us) however there is nothing waiting for it 'on the other side' once it dies and rots away.",ubfj7k,"If reality is persistent, it seems to follow that you may be reincarnated or regain sentience at some point in the infinite future.

Donald Trump argues that he is smart for using these deductions. In reality, let’s get real, his accountants are the smart ones and he shouldn’t get credit for their savvy accounting.

That being said, as a business man it makes sense to utilize every legal means necessary to lower your tax payments in order to maximize your take home profits. That’s just business.

Therefore, I believe that this release reveals more about the terrible structure of our tax system in America and how the rich have been given an extraordinary amount of loopholes and write off opportunities that are not available to your average working class citizen, which is resulting in them paying severely less than their fair share of taxes in this country.

I believe that Trump’s political opponents would do much better to focus on this issue head on instead of personally attacking Trump, and use this as an opportunity to enact significant tax reforms in this country that would benefit working class Americans and finally make the wealthy elites pay their fair share in taxes.

So far, no one has definitively proven that any of these write offs have been technically illegal (feel free to correct me on that if I’m wrong. I’ve seen several articles saying he MAY have committed some sort of tax infraction, but these laws have a lot of gray area and room for interpretation).However, given the obvious outrage most people seem to have with them, it is obvious that these available write offs do not have public supper and they have certainly being abused constantly on a systemic issue. And THAT is the real issue here.

Like they say, don’t hate the player hate the game. And currently, the game is rigged and it needs to be fixed.",j2k21d,"&gt; Like they say, don’t hate the player hate the game. And currently, the game is rigged and it needs to be fixed.

I generally agree, except to say that Trump is the one currently making the rules to the game. He doesnt change the rules because he benefits from them. That's a huge conflict of interest that should be highlighted.",g75sx1p
Suicide prevention is not a moral good,"By definition, and regardless of the circumstances motivating that choice, a person committing suicide chooses to end their life.

Therefore, justifying suicide prevention requires either the assumption that the person is incapable of making that choice, or that they have no right to make that choice, or that such a choice is always wrong *and* society has the right to decide that for an individual.

All of these justifications seem highly suspect to me. In a functioning society, the capability to make informed choices is assumed by default, even for horrifying actions. That’s why most murderers go to prison and not to a psychiatric facility. The fact that they committed an incomprehensible crime doesn’t automatically mean they were incapable of choosing correctly. In light of that, the blanket assumption that suicidal people cannot make an informed choice to end their life is hypocritical.

The idea that people have no *right* to end their own life is even more problematic. It raises the question: “Why not?” I honestly cannot think of any way to justify this assertion that doesn’t rely on religious or other ad-hoc assumptions. It gets even worse when people attempt to argue that society/family “still needs” the person; this just reeks of a utilitarian ideology wherein a human is only as good as what they can provide to others.

Finally, the claim that suicide is *always* wrong sounds a bit like the idea that killing is *always* wrong. It’s an immature position for which most people can find numerous counterexamples without much effort. When such an extreme position is used to inform policy, and is further amplified by coercive measures like involuntary psychiatric treatment, it becomes just another iteration of lobotomy-style medical overreach, driven by people who believe they have the right to make fundamental decisions for others.

In summary, I believe that the blanket assumption that suicides should be prevented regardless of the circumstances is ethically dubious, and the way suicide prevention is conducted in psychiatric practice represents an indefensible overreach by people who have no moral standing to force their position on others. Change my view!",kucj35,"First of all what are you talking about when you say ""Suicide Prevention""? Offering Suicide Hotlines and trying to convince people to not kill themselves is not forcing anyone to do or not do anything. Since you're only argument is that it's ""Their choice"" suicide prevention doesn't take that away.   
If you're talking about the police preventing people from jumping this makes sense from a purely logistical perspective as someone would have to clean that mess up. If someone was throwing watermelons of bridges the police would stop you as well.   


Locking people away in suicide prevention cells after they tried to commit suicide? I'm against that. Doing my best to convince someone that they shouldn't kill themselves? I don't see how that's any more immoral than trying to convince someone of any opinion.   


&gt;  It’s an immature position for which most people can find numerous counterexamples without much effort

Bill Cosby's Case Should be Overturned,"The reason Cosby was even able to be prosecuted was because the DA promised him that he wouldn't be prosecuted. This prevented Cosby from pleading the 5th in civil trial, and he had to admit to what he did, so his victims could get compensation. The DA then did a switcheroo and prosecuted Cosby criminally despite his promise to him. While I absolutely despise what Cosby did, there simply wasn't any way for the DA to prosecute him before Cosby confessed. Cosby would not have confessed if the DA didn't promise not to prosecute. 

The DA breaking his promise is *frightening* because that means they were then allowed to essentially lie to defendants to coerce them into confessions. Without this precedent being overturned, there were going to be a lot more far-ranging effects than the effect of one one old rapist not going to prison.",ob6ake,"&gt;The reason Cosby was even able to be prosecuted was because the DA promised him that he wouldn't be prosecuted.

Predators should not be culled because they can kill people,"I always hear about proposals to reduce the numbers of already endangered predators, or even flat out refusing reintroduction due to the threat these animals can pose to people.

I understand where they are coming from with animal deaths on farms, (although over-grazing by herbivores does much more damage to the economy and the surplus gained from predators can be repaid to damaged farmers), but to reduce the population of a species so severely because one or two people got killed?  It's ridiculous.

If you swim in shark infested waters, camp in the woods with bears or go into jungles with tigers, you must know the risks. In most cases, death could of been avoided with proper preparation and caution. It is not the animals fault for attempting to survive.

Ther also seems to be a gross overestimation of the amount of people predators kill, which i'll blame the media for, but that is a different topic",cpv55j,"I think few people focus solely on the danger to people but instead look towards property and animals as well.  

A concrete example is the reintroduction of wolves in northern Germany. Although noone has died/been injured a lot of people don't want to go into the forest anymore.  People choosing not to go hike in nature is a bad thing. 

Farmers complain a lot and new really tall fances (wolves jump pretty good) need to be build to protect livestock. 

Germany is small compared to singles US states, with a lot of villages everywhere and most land is used for something. Coupled with a historical hunting culture keeping dear population in check there is really no reason for wolves to be here. We were fine without wolves (they were gone for over 100 years).",ewrsvs7
Anarchists/communists/anti-capitalists etc. who carelessly consume luxury products produced by capitalism arent living in accordance with their ideology.,"I've tried having this discussion on a few leftist/ideological debate subs and haven't made a lot of progress. I'm hoping some folks here who haven't drunk the koolaid might be able to help!

It seems to me that an anti-capitalist  (anarchist, communist, etc.) who, say, sits around Starbucks drinking double frap extra pump whip whatevers in brand new Nike's as they browse Reddit on the latest Macbook is, at best, not living in accordance with their ideology, and at worst a hypocrite. 

The response I got when I posed this to leftists was mainly mockery and scorn. ""We live in a society!"" they said, ""how can you expect us to not participate in that society? Should we all just starve to death rather than buy food produced by capitalism?"" 

I dont think my view is that unreasonable. I dont begrudge any anti-capitalist doing what they have to do to survive in a capitalist system, and largely capitalist world. And FWIW I would consider some level of recreation/leisure/enjoyment to be essential to survival, or perhaps just mental health. 

Just as an example, say an anti-capitalist wants to read a book. Some anarchist literature, perhaps. Do they buy the book from a local mom-and-pop used bookstore, or do they buy it ""new"" on their $300 Amazon Kindle? The former shows a desire to engage with capitalism, particularly big-business, super corrupt and exploitative capitalism, as minimally as possible while still getting what they want; the latter shows a willingness to engage in and support the very worst forms of capitalism... at best it seems to show an indifference to it, neither of which really fit for a self-described anti-capitalist. 

It's sort of like if someone claimed to be a climate change/environmental/green advocate but they pour their used oil down storm drains, eat cheeseburgers twice a day, and drive the biggest gas guzzling SUV they could find. Like, obviously they have to eat and depending on where they live they might have to drive, and both of those things will impact the environment, but there are greener alternatives that they've foregone for luxury or convenience. 

Am I missing something here? The cynic in me likes to think that the visceral negative reaction I've gotten from anti-capitalists when i suggest that maybe they ought to stop wantonly supporting capitalism for their mere enjoyment and comfort is just because they're loathe to put their money where their mouths is and actually make any sacrifices for their beliefs. But it is fully possible I'm just missing something here, and they have a totally valid reason for giving their patronage to mega-companies like Nike or Amazon or Starbucks or Reddit while still being a genuine anti-capitalist.",cgiind,"Do you have similar issues with capatilist who send their children to public schools, visit public parks, vote and/or drive on roads?

Looks are just as important as personality when dating. (Maybe more?),"I hear so many people saying that you should find a partner based off of their personality and not based off of looks. I've heard people say if you judge a person off of their looks when dating then you are going to end up hating your relationship. Could that happen? Yes and it could also happen if you judged a person off of personality.

**To me** looks are a first impression, rather you want them to be or not (It is literally the first thing I see) When I date someone I want to enjoy looking at them. I have a type and even if they have the best personality in the world I most likely won't find an interest if they are not my type. When I take interest in someone because I like the way they look I still make sure they are a decent person. 

As far as what personality even means.. Being nice? Being funny? Liking the same things as me??

  
I can still date based off of looks and have the intelligence to not form a relationship if the person is mean/rude to me or others. I can still like someone if they aren't funny. I do not care what they like to do or what they find interesting when I'm dating someone. Everyone I've dated in the past has had a fascination with anime and random fighting video games. I don't like anime or fighting games so does this mean I'm not meant to be with this person? To mean that makes no sense. Also I have never dated someone who completely enjoys everything that I find interesting and that has never caused an issue. I'm not looking for my boyfriend to be a carbon copy of me. Plus at the end of the day if you love your partner you can sometimes just do what they like to do not because you like it but because you want to make them happy.

The only thing I care about in a man is:  Is he attractive to me? Do I like him? Is he nice to me? Is he nice to himself? Is he financially stable to support himself? If the answer isn't yes to all of these questions then I'm not interested in being with them.",u09psl,"An apt comparison I’ve heard and found to be accurate:

Looks are the resume, personality is the interview.

So sure, looks will help land you the interview, but if you bomb the interview, you won’t get the job.

So if your goal is landing a long term relationship, personality is more important than looks.

Looks might get you lots of interviews, but if you don’t have a good interview (personality) nothing is going to stick.",i44k158
'The end justifies the means' is a dangerous idea.,"The problems I see with the idea that the end justifies the means are mainly two:

1. The 'end', the actual outcome, cannot usually be predicted accurately. Therefore even if the intention was good, that can't be an excuse for doing evil.

2. If the means are violent then the end will most likely be violent or oppressive. 

I think what people mean when they use this sentence is that IF it leads to something good, a little evil to get there is justified. 

But if 'the means' add to the already existing evil, that will just increase the amount of evil in the world. 

Thinking that this can ever lead to more good seems absurd to me.

In short: if someone claims that the end justifies the means I would want to know why this person believes they know the future.

If the future in a certain case is indeed predictable, I think the end can sometimes justify the means, but that would be extremely rare and special cases.",dk31s8,"What about a civil war that ends slavery, but ends up with thousands of people dying as a result?",f4a49n6
Car lights should turn on when the wipers are on.,"Specifically what I mean is that the wiper control and headlight control should be linked, to where if your wipers are set to any non-interval setting, or at any interval selection beyond the lowest speed (or maybe second lowest) the exterior lights should automatically come on, even if the car itself does not have an auto headlights feature in the sense of sensing brightness outside or having DRLs. Using the mist function or the washer (as long as the selector is not in one of the positions I named above) of course won't activate them as there's no need.

In modern cars, most exterior light relays are controlled digitally, and the specific setting of the wiper control is also read digitally by the wiper controller. If it's raining or snowing enough to warrant turning them on beyond their lowest interval setting, there is some measure of reduced visibility. I am willing to forego the requirement of having it for delay wipers but when using low or high it is a must. Linking these two systems together would increase visibility to other drivers, especially in the case of cars that have gray/silver paint schemes that might blend a little more easily with a drab rainy day.

The downsides that I foresee and consider acceptable to still warrant implementing this:

- Increased wear on lights, shortening the over all amount of time they're installed in a vehicle before needing replacement. This is only mandatory during times when your wipers are on, and with LEDs becoming more and more the norm for exterior lighting it is becoming more and more of a non-issue.

- Increased complexity/cost. Most cars already have some sort of communications bus between modules, if the wiper module isn't already linked in then hooking it up with the necessary extra chips and a wire or two more isn't going to be that more complex, and when you're already dropping 5 figures for a new car eating an extra $5 or so is hardly a drop in the bucket.

- Many cars on the road won't have this feature for a while if implemented. We gotta start somewhere just like we did for all the other safety improvements, over time the cars not equipped will likely wind up in a scrap yard.

- Driver is less in control of a vehicle function. You still have control, just in times when you need wipers the system overrides your control. In the States at least we've largely relinquished control over our transmission, we've relinquished many other things to automatic this or that no problem and it's often sold as a feature. In the case you might need wipers but not want lights if you're like a PI or something staking out, PRNDL selection is also digitally read these days so the system can be implemented to not activate if the car is in Park.

Tell me CMV, why *shouldn't* we have this simple safety measure added into our cars? For just a few bucks more per car we get increased visibility of cars on the road during adverse conditions and it's done automatically for us, what's not to like?",nl5who,"You do realize this does exist on a lot of modern cars with rain sensing wipers, right?",gzmzkfe
A corporate/professional dress code has no practical function other than distinguishing those who wear it from the unemployed or labouring class.,"I understand why a labourer wears high visibility clothes when they're working at night, why they wear steel capped boots and a helmet. I don't understand why a man with an office job can't wear a singlet. ""Because it's unprofessional"". What is inherently unprofessional about it (beyond its association with the working class)? Men can also rarely wear shorts, even when made out of the same material as suit pants. I understand why flip flops shouldn't be worn in an office (OHS) and yet heels are allowed? One woman could wear a low cut top and have no cleavage, whereas another may wear the same style and be reprimanded because the shape of her body has created cleavage.

I believe people who volunteer for admin/moderator positions are power hungry and get satisfaction in controlling other people.,"CMV: People who volunteer in admin/mod roles in an organization are power hungry and like having power over others.

The statement is obviously not true for everyone, but I find that a good number of people who volunteer for these positions (and sometimes the paid ones too) just get off on having power over others no matter how small or inconsequential. 
 
Examples: Home owners association admins who drive around looking for homes to scrutinize even when it’s a small infraction; server moderators who threaten removal of content or removal from the server when someone doesn’t respect them to the degree they want; and channel moderators who screen everything to such a minute level that they end up hindering free speech.

Civil political discussion is dead.,"It's amazing how if you look back at videos of political discussions and debates from even just a couple of decades ago, people are much more respectful and open to having their views challenged than nowadays. And this is true of all groups. 

Today, it's hard to have any remotely right-wing person speak without Antifa shouting over them and pulling the fire alarm, or to have any remotely left-wing person speak without being framed as a Communist and ignored. The words ""Fascist"" and ""Communist"" get thrown around so much that they've lost all meaning. Hardly anyone is willing to sit down and genuinely consider the other side's ideas, oftentimes on the mere principle of what the opposition identifies as politically. News sources have devolved into echo-chambers (which is likely part of the reason why all of this is happening), and everyone has an ""I'm right, you're wrong"" mindset and attitude. And probably worst of all, people are so dedicated and entrenched in their ideals that even objective, irrefutable facts which prove that they're wrong still isn't enough to sway them.

So if you ask me, any semblance of political civility, especially amongst average people, is dead. Change my mind.",ks4sfb,"I think this subreddit is proof that this is false.

Politicians shouldn't be expected to visit victims after a disaster,"For example, visiting after fires, extreme weather, natural disasters and mass shootings.

1) Travelling can be time-consuming and tiring. They should spend the time working on solutions (determining the best course of action and working on making it persuasive enough that it could be implemented)

2) I don't think the victims should have greater influence on politicians than anyone else. They probably don't have special insights into the problem (whether it's a fire, extreme weather, natural disaster, mass shooting or terrorist attack). So there is probably little to be gained from a visit or communication. But if they are thought to have some insight, it would probably be better arrangements to be made for them to visit the President (or Prime Minister, or other senior politician).",v43s2p,"If politicians are attempting to understand the problem in a genuine way in order to pass effective legislation, it makes sense for them to go to affected people and hear what they want/need. Making decisions based on disconnected/inaccurate views or missing the nuance in situations around unforeseen consequences of disasters are more likely if a politician has never experienced something or heard from their constituents.

Also, visiting victims of a disaster can be an important use of the bully pulpit (more for presidents), to push for legislation in a stalled or deadlocked congress. Getting publicity onto the human tragedy of situations can force previously disconnected or aloof politicians into action. It can also remind voters of what a politician isn’t doing, reminding them of inaction when they have the power to make real change.",ib247nh
The rise of alternative performers (such as singers or athletes) within the blockbuster movie industry is proof that a high film budget can make nearly anyone an okay actor.,"Acting of top tier quality is mastery of the skill and requires years of experience.  I'm not talking about individuals like Jake Gyllenhaal or Leonardo DiCaprio.

As more and more performers that have little to no acting experience get shoed into large films because of their fame,  I find that I'm NOT saying to myself ""damn they are terrible"", at least most of the time.  They don't stand out as stealing the scenes, but they aren't a sore thumb either.  It stands to reason that anyone with a good memory and a modicum of comfort performing can seem decent at acting when a large film budget with excellent editors is available. 

That said, there are plenty of people who simply could not do this.  Also,  a counter point I could see coming up is they are used to the performing arts in general; I don't think this gives them a leg up in acting skill. 

This is a much less serious topic than usual on here, so I'm interested what you all think.  If it wasn't obvious, this view stems from my friends and I thinking we could be on par with these men/ women who never act stepping on the screen.",gha6f4,"You bring up good points, however I don't think you can discredit these peoples history with performing arts. A lot of what a musician would do to prepare for a performance is similar to preparing for shooting a movie; where to stand, when to move and where, how to learn verbal and non-verbal cues as to what to do. Also, especially for singers/songwriters that use ghost writers, the ability to read and memorize lyrics or lines, is a skill adapted through practice. Memorizing a song for a recording is much like memorizing lines for a shoot. Also, these musicians are often not given really significant roles that could make or break the movie, therefor we don't critique their performance as much because it isn't as important. I also think there is some bias when rating non-actors in movies because we know they are not actors so we don't hold them to the same standards",fq7jbkx
"Slavery Was The Most Important, If Not Only Cause of the Civil War","The Civil War was the most important, if not only, caused by the debate over the issue of slavery. The main causes of the civil war were the Missouri Compromise (a failed compromise over slavery) Compromise of 1850 (a failed compromise over slavery), Bleeding Kansas (a violent squabble over whether Kansas and Nebraska should be slave or free states), and the election of Lincoln (which caused secession because of a fear that he would limit the growth of, or even ban, slavery). 

Some people argue that states rights was a more important cause, but the state right to do what? Have slavery!!! Even when some states didn’t want to be a slave state, like California, the South pushed against this. They didn’t care about the states rights of states unless it was in acting in favor of slavery.

The Confederate States constitution was the exact same as the U.S. construction except for an added line that guaranteed the right of slavery.

Some point to the fact that not everyone in the north was against slavery, and just wanted to keep the union together. But by the Emancipation Proclamation, the north’s goal officially included ending slavery (at the very least in the south; slavery was still legal in slave states in the union to ensure victory in the war).
 
Simply put, the South was only fighting the war to keep their ability to own slaves. Any other cause is directly related to slavery. Change my view.

Edit: Many people have discussed that the south fought for slavery and the north fought for unity. I agree with this. However, if we look at the reason why the war started instead of the purpose of fighting for each side, it’s clear to me that the reason the war started was slavery.",ezkpau,"The fact that the civil war almost began with the tarrif of abominations in 1828 is proof that that's wrong.

People and organizations should have to disclose all instances of paying (or otherwise compensating) for another person or organization to speak for them. The definition of lobbying is too narrow.,"The world of influence is complicated. We have overt advertisements, which are annoying, but at least obviously advertisements. But we also have an entire industry of subtle advertisements. Politicians and companies can purchase crowds to flood protests or hearings. They can buy actors to infiltrate these groups and spread a specific message. They can hire people to go on any number of forums to promote a message. All under the guise of someone who honestly believes the message, or as a member of an established community. Frankly, it makes one paranoid to consider that any given moment on a discussion board, that honest discussion you thought you were having about X might actually be with a shill paid for by someone who stands to benefit immensely from X. The presumption of good faith discussion is lost thanks to this industry. 

The presumption of good faith discussion is incredibly valuable. It's what makes the first amendment work. Without that presumption, the first amendment doesn't work, it's worthless. Therefore, the first amendment should not apply to paid for speech. Anonymizing speech is valuable for genuine held beliefs. But it is not valuable for paid actors. 

The most effective way to protect genuine belief holders, and not paid actors is to require any organization that is buying speech to disclose the speech they buy. If an oil company wants to flood the internet with overt and subtle advertisements against hybrid cars, then it should be required to report that within days if not hours of signing the contract with the advertising/shill agency. The reports should be widely and freely available for anyone to check, so they can determine the likelihood of the message they are engaging with being subtle advertising. 

Companies that fail to register paid speech should be subject to fines and potentially jail time for corporate officers. Individuals should face the same risks. If fines are the preferred punishment, they should actually be costly enough to make a difference, rather than just being the cost of doing business, but I'm not sure there is a fine costly enough to make a difference. Advertising agencies should be required to also report any paid speech they engage in, which would be all of their business, as a secondary means of catching bad actors.",la3rwp,"I like the spirit but there are ways around this.

Sometimes they only outsource graphics.

Every investor is a speculator (and vice versa),"Even professional investors become speculators, and vice versa.  This is because we are humans and not robots.    
Bill Gurley, billionaire venture capitalist, recently said that even though he thinks valuations are crazy, he has to stay in the game because his firm did the research, and if they don’t participate, and invest, in the final few years of speculative froth, they will underperform and lose assets.    
So even the most steady hands who view themselves as logical investors will be caught up from time to time and speculate.    
By speculate, I mean you are only investing because you believe someone will pay more due to the market environment, not due to company fundamentals. But then, when the market blows up, some speculators stay the course, start doing due diligence, taking their time, and buying the best companies at reasonable valuations.

"Repeat Pedophiles, Rapists and Sex Offenders should have no human rights.","


First off I want to make things clear, I know people who know people that have been ""wrongfully"" convicted of a sex crime or crime against a child. And that's why I am saying REPEAT. Because I know that false convinctions happen. Okay so now that's clear. 
I think that Repeat Pedophiles, Rapists and Sex Offenders (I'll just say ""pedos"" from here on out) should have no human rights. For somebody to commit such a crime and be convicted of it multiple times imo forfeits their right to freedom and control over what happens to there body. I do think they should have food and water to keep them alive, but I do think they should be put in gen-pop in prisons, placed on suicide watch and be used as lab rats or subjects for expirementations and stop testing things on animals and start testing on pedos. I also think they should be castrated, chemically and physically. I want pedos to be alive and abused.

I know it sounds harsh but I've heard from family, friends &amp;amp; mutual friends and some strangers the horror and utter disgust of certain types of crimes commited by these pedos. I just want to know other peoples opinions on this and to see if I should change my view on this subject. Thank you in advance.

Edit: I just want to say that i know it would scar people and I understand that, but I feel that a ""pedo"" should have no right to protection. That's it.



I also would like to add some things I've been told of from my family member who is a former detectives and federal agent. A man 20 years old middle class, raised by two loving parents who was never once abused or arrested. He one day decided to go to pick up his sister from school with her friend (sister age 10, sister's friend age 11). And he crashed the car killing his sister. He grabbed the friend and took her into an old building. Where he raped her, cut her hands off and pleasured himself with them. He cut her head of and used her mouth as a form of pleasure. When he was arrested he was screened by multiple shrinks. He had no form of sociopathy or personality disorders. He showed no signs of regret. He even bragged about his crimes. And went to prison he was ratted out and people did unspeakable things to him. They gave him food and kept him well fed.

"As an anti-Trump voter, all the nitpicking at President Trump's little shortcomings (e.g. held a Bible the wrong way, overweight, how he gave money wrong at church) is extremely counterproductive, distracts from the real issues, and feeds the narrative that he's treated unfairly.","I saw a video today of President Trump giving some money at church in Las Vegas. The entire article was about how he fanned the money out in a showy display. 

Full disclosure: I think President Trump is an embarassment and a destructive force who NEEDS to be voted out of office for the sake of the USA and the world at large. But I watched the video and thought: he did nothing wrong here. He MIGHT have intended to ""show off"" the \~$60 he put in the plate...but he could have just been checking how much was in his hand or fidgeting as anyone else would do. He certainly could afford to give more, but many people don't give as much money as normal (or any at all--which is fine!) when they are visiting a church. Nothing he did in the video was objectionable, and yet the article took a bunch of shots at him based on how he held his money, how little he gave, what may have been going on in his mind--a bunch of cheap shots, but more importantly, all regarding something pretty insignificant.

The problem with this kind of cheap piling on (and I could give a hundred examples) is that it's unfair and mean, and so it very much justifies the President's supporters pointing out unfair treatment, which leads to further entrenching their support of him.  Furthermore, it dilutes out and de-emphasizes all of his horrible behavior, lapses in ethics, and the terrible amount of REAL damage he's done. 

If we really want to change minds and vote him out of office--instead of having another Democrat popular vote win and a ""too close to call"" electoral college victory (for one side or the other)--we should focus on the much more significant and real damage he has done. This would help by (1) enabling much broader agreement on a set of facts; (2) avoid causing supporters of the President to dig in defensively for no reason; (3) focus on the real issues.",je1nvb,"Mustard, tan suit, birth certificate, Muslim traitor... but Obama was treated so fairly lol",g9cg2aq
Joe Biden has very little chance of reelection in 2024.,"I believe that, should Joe Biden run for reelection in 2024, he is almost certain to lose. 

1. He is quite unpopular. His approval rating is lower than Trump's was during the 2020 election, and the Electoral College has a GOP bias under current coalitions. The main reason for his unpopularity is because he's seen as not having accomplished enough to improve Americans' lives. Once Republicans take back Congress, is he going to accomplish more? Of course not.
2. Election fuckery. Once the midterms are a bloodbath for Democrats, there will be many Republicans in a position to subvert the 2024 election via increased voter suppression, voter intimidation, and even outright theft via certifying results for the losing candidates. Even if Biden receives enough votes to win, it may not matter.
3. Geopolitical issues. Now, I voted for Biden in 2020, and will again if I have to, but you cannot argue that the country's in better shape than it was in 2020. Between the ongoing and worsening COVID crisis that Biden refuses to do anything about, the war between Russia and Ukraine that may become World War III, and the state-level anti-LGBTQ+ laws, the country's in a worse position in 2022 than it was in 2020. Quite frankly, if I didn't know any better, I'd look at everything happening in this country right now and think Trump were still President.
4. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. Assuming Trump is the nominee again, polls already show him with a sizable lead over Biden. Part of this is because he's not in office right now, and out of the spotlight a bit more, but I think any Democrat wanting Trump to be returned to Twitter for this reason should be careful what they wish for.
5. If the nominee is DeSantis, the Democrats are in even more trouble. Conservatives absolutely adore the red meat he feeds the base; he's an even more potent culture warrior than Trump is. If DeSantis is the nominee, he will turn out some low-propensity Republican voters who may not have voted for Trump. Looking at Biden, who has offered the American people next to nothing except ""normality"" (which got us here in the first place!), it's not hard to see who would win that matchup.

So there you go. CMV.",ur5ski,"Best thing democrats can do is run a different candidate. Younger, maybe female, but not too far left.

"Obi Wan Kenobi might not have been the strongest or most powerful Jedi, but he was the Jedi MVP","Almost everything Obi Wan did, he did right. The only mistake he really made was not seeing what was happening to Anakin earlier and failing to stop it. Other than that, he's accomplished more than any other Jedi. He defeated the first sith seen in a thousand years after it killed his master. He trained two of the most powerful jedis of all time. He dedicated the rest of his life after order 66 to protecting Luke Skywalker. He defeated general grevious when no one else could. He found he clone army. He defeated and maimed Anakin so badly in their duel that he was way less powerful and was not able to reach his full potential. In addition to all of this, he is one of the few Jedi shown to truly embody the Jedi code. He never let his feelings cloud his judgement (unless you count sparing Anakin, but it can be argued this was the Jedi way).

Democratic politicians and interest groups and ignoring and falsifying the science around COVID policy to advance their political agendas,"(1) On reopening of schools, many Democratic politicians and teachers' unions have called for continuing shutdowns, contrary to the consensus of infectious disease experts that school, especially for young children, are safe.

(5) Democrats also refuse to interrogate and examine the actual costs of the lockdowns weighed against the lives actually lost due COVID.

Asians have also been slaves in the U.S. and this isn’t mainstream education in this country.,"Asian indentured servants, or “coolies” as a derogatory term, have been used as a source of cheap labor in the United States as early as the 1800s.

While indentured servants are different from slaves because they have paid contracts, in the case of Asian coolies (and also many indentured African servants in the Antebellum South) they were oftentimes duped into free labor or sold to another employer in the States where their original “contracts” were voided. 

“In practice, however, as many opponents of coolie labor argued, abuse and violence was rampant. **Some of these laborers signed contracts based on misleading promises, some were kidnapped and sold into the trade, some were victims of clan violence whose captors sold them to coolie brokers,** while others sold themselves to pay off gambling debts.”

On the Pacific Passage:

“As many as 500 were crammed into a single ship hold, leaving no room to move. **Some of these were Chinese women kidnapped to be sex slaves under the demand of American and Caribbean plantation owners.**”

(Both cited from Wiki)

**More compelling to me when asking if coolie labor was a form of slavery, is how the California state government eventually came to define it in its 1879 Constitution:**

**""Asiatic coolieism is a form of human slavery, and is forever prohibited in this State, and all contracts for coolie labour shall be void.”**

Interestingly enough, Abraham Lincoln also signed “An Act to Prohibit the ‘Coolie Trade’” months before his Emancipation Proclamation.

**Edit:** It’s been fascinating to see the debates about this oscillate back and forth from “no they weren’t slaves” to “yes they were and everybody learned about this in school.” Which is it?

Democrats impeaching is a poor political move,"The main argument for impeachment I've seen is that the evidence suggests Trump is guilty and therefore should be impeached because that is what is right, regardless of what the Republican leadership says.

I would say I agree that the evidence is quite clear that Trump abused the power of his office, but the current political landscape means that being ""right"" doesn't really matter. Republicans have made it clear that they do not support impeachment and think that Trump is innocent (whether they truly believe this or just want to retain the presidency is up for debate). So, the articles of impeachment will be passed along party lines. Regardless of whether or not impeachment is ""right"", this makes it an entirely political act. Because the vote falls on party lines and the democrats hold the majority, it is easily construed as the Dems abusing their majority to attempt to remove a president they don't like. The articles move to the senate where the trial will happen. Mitch McConnell is best at blocking and overriding anything he doesn't like and as the majority leader in the senate will have no problems stone-walling conviction. The vote here will likely fall along party lines as well, further politicizing the process. At the end of the day, Trump won't be convicted and there will be an easy sound bite that the dems attempted a political coup, and the lack of conviction indicates no harm was done. This will drive moderate voters to vote Trump in opposition to the democrats' audacity to try and overthrow a president. Trump will likely be re-elected and the whole thing will have been for naught. Further, it will give a free-pass to more of this abusive behavior for his second term and future presidents.",ecfi68,"Your view makes a lot of sense, but seems to hinge in the fact that by politicizing the proceedings, the Democratic party is alienating potential moderate/centrist votes -- and therefore the process wil have a negative impact on the DNC during the election

Regardless of the impeachment proceedings, Trump is the favourite to win the upcoming election. Faced with this fact, the DNC knows that whoever they nominate is unlikely to secure a democratic presidency. Given the small chance they have of winning, the Democrats are instead putting their eggs in the impeachment basket. IF they can secure an impeachment, and IF the can secure a conviction, their electoral position improves dramatically. 

Basically, they recognize their chances of winning against Trump are so slim already, that any damage done by their handling of the impeachment will be inconsequential in comparison. They have nothing to lose and everything to gain in this situation, regardless of the politization of the process.",fbazoa8
Almost every modern human should be on some sort of neurological/psych medication.,"Humans have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to adapt to an environment in how we sleep, eat, work, etc.  In the last 30 or so years, technology has disrupted those needs.  Work hours have dramatically changed the way sleep aligns with circadian rhythms, technology has changed the speed at which information is presented to us so that ""traditional"" information flows are uncomfortably slow (kids having trouble in classroom learning, reading books being less preferred compared to audio books and podcasts, etc.).  Highly accessible food has changed the nutrition profiles we get and our bodies no longer process food for survival but for waste overflow.

Given how much our lifestyles and biology are diverging, it is no surprise ""disorders"" like adhd, depression, anxiety, and other things are emerging and more common.  In a lot of cases, things that modify the attention span might actually be adaptations to information flows.  Expecting people to thrive in a world so obviously divergent from the environment we evolved to adapt to without help seems unreasonable.  While the science is obviously in it's relative infancy, it is predictable that psych meds to help people adapt will be widespread and should not be stigmatized.  While we may find long term pros and cons as the use of meds is studied over lifetimes, it is cruel to limit their use now in fear of potential negative consequences when contrast to obvious and actual realized struggles and suffering.

Edit: I took a break for work, but I see a lot of personal criticism and generalization, and not a lot of real discussion, I'll read more later, but my view now is ""unchanged but man the reddit hive mind hates people recommending psych medication.""  I think that's my problem here, psych medication is blanket off the table for most people before they even start a discussion.  That stigma needs to be reversed and a lot of suffering can be avoided with better prescribing and less stigma.  One person linked a study linking psychopharmacology and psychotherapy to outcomes no better than placebo, however it's an aggregate study of other studies and while it's a great point of discussion, I'm finding trouble with the conclusions...for example, in the first one I read, the placebo for psychotherapy was ""Tango dancing.""

They told us they 50 or so staff would be working through Christmas and probably through January, which was huge for people making sure they had a paycheck. The Wednesday before thanksgiving this same employer called us to let us know that literally none of the employees were needed back. So, the day before thanksgiving I had to lay off an entire staff.

The mine laying was never a part of a direct invasion. Britain were to respond to this by landing troops in Narvik, Trondheim and Bergen.

"Elections should not be based on a two party system, but rather, they should be based on a ranking system.","In elections, at least in the US, when you are presented a ballot (at least to my understanding, I've only voted twice), you are expected to choose the top candidate. Wouldn't it make more sense to rank at least your top 5 in order of who you think would be best to worst?  The way I picture it, that makes sense in my mind, is that if it's similar to NASCAR where you earn points based on the position that you are in, then the smaller parties would have a better chance at being a competitive part of the elections, and it would force voters to focus more on the issues that each candidate's platform addresses, rather than just picking the lesser of two evils. 

From the views that I have seen on Facebook, primarily regarding the upcoming presidential election, both parties seem to be focused on not letting the other side win, with the argument that they are the better candidate because the other one isn't. Can someone explain why we keep the two party system the way that it is? Thank you!",hsbn7m,"First off, a ranking system in the context of a presidential election becomes more strategic rather than honest. Under this system, the likelihood of a candidate absolutely blowing all other candidates out of the water becomes very small, and thus candidates have, more or less, a fighting chance to win. If I truly like Candidate B, and absolutely hated Candidate D, but thought that Candidate D was unlikely to lose early, I might decide to vote based on who I believe is most likely to beat Candidate D rather than voting for my favorite candidate.

With a 2-party system, it also prevents more radical and single-issue viewpoints from taking a position of power. With a multi-choice ranked ballot, this possibility is still unlikely, but the 2-party system practically guarantees it.

2-party systems also simply make things easier for voters to follow. While not all politicians are strict in the beliefs shared by their party, one could reasonably look at which party they’re a member of and conclude what they might stand for. Keep in mind, I’m not one to encourage political ignorance, but for those who aren’t well versed in politics, the 2-party system makes it much easier to understand who stands on what side of a political issue.

One might make the case that, since the 2-party system makes it easier for a voter to gauge what a candidate’s positions might be, it would increase voter turnout. Not to mention the fact that creating more options for candidates could also lead to a presidency that way less than half of the nation wanted at all.

I would argue and say that the two-party system is simply the most effective. Maybe not the most fair, but the most effective. Guaranteeing that the winner is someone that holds a very large plurality, if not a majority, also guarantees that the winner is generally agreed upon by most people. 

As for the rest of the government, having more than 2 major parties in Congress would seek to make the process much worse. The process for legislature in the US, for example, is specifically designed to be slow and methodical, allowing for every aspect of a new bill to be thought out and debated before being enacted; because of this, a bill is doomed to fail if a simple majority isn’t reached. If there were multiple parties in this process, it’d be very difficult to do that. Compromise between MANY different parties, all of differing viewpoints and ideologies, would be difficult to obtain a simple majority.",fycfb3b
"he Minimum Wage should be based on an economic calculation, not on a fixed dollar amount.","The Federal minimum wage is $7.25. As the economy moves up and down that number stays fixed. Almost as soon as it is adjusted it begins to be out of date. This could be fixed by having the minimum wage based on an economic calculation. For example it could be a calculation based on covering minimum living standards for shelter, food and transportation. The [Consumer Price Index](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/) could be used to adjust this value for local economies. It would reset every six months or so.

This would take it out of the political arena and make it a truly stable tool to keep the economy functioning.

Why don't I see this as part of the minimum wage conversation? It's always just - should we change it? How much should it be.

But now the committee that recalculates and updates that indicator *knows* that any result they publish may drastically *affect* the economy by changing the minimum wage. Politicians on either side of the issue may directly or indirectly try to exert pressure on them to skew the number one way or the other. It will very rapidly lose its value as an economic measure.

Instead, it will measure the ability of various politicians to influence it. And, if you want a number that represents a value that politicians were able to reach agreement on... the natural way to do that is to just legislate the number directly.",f1t42m7
People who actively decline to donate organs should be declined organ donations themselves,"I see how this is a morally problematic stance.
I am generally not for “what goes around comes around” approaches, but in my view, organ donations are literally a matter of life issue and arise above just the individual.
It’s more than just being a little egoistic if you purposefully decline to save other people’s lives.
If you actively, (which includes being over 18 and mentally stable) decline to donate your organs than I personally think it is fair to not grant you such a valuable gift. 
On the other side such a rule could push people to rethink their stance and would probably have an immensely positive effect on the number of organ donors.

The only two problems I see with this is that in reality it will be tough to draw such a border between those who “actively” decline organs and those who might be pressured by their environment or aren’t stable etc. and that such a restriction could lead to a sort of organ elitism by people then demand that we should also not give organs to addicts, obese people etc..

As often religious believes are a reason for not wanting to donate, I think that a lot of those believes also include not wanting to receive strangers organs anyways.

I am really interested to hear your thoughts on this. CMV!


Edit: This has been an exciting read so far! As some things keep on being brought up:

A) this is a thought experiment, I’m not in a position to enforce anything I’m here to challenge a viewpoint and that overall philosophical not bureaucratically.

B) This is about people actively opting out on donation, not people being unable to donor due to illness etc. at those are not active choices. 

C) I agree that the opt-out system is a great way to increase donations and I am very much for it’s implementation. If we wanna go down the rabbits whole of implementing the here proposed scenario it was actually what I had in mind, because in the opt-out scenario an active choice is the most obvious. But this would further of course need a lot of detailed legal work I am unable to provide.",d91kkj,I know some countries you have to opt out of being a donor,f1fn0m3
Cashiers should never be forced to stand if not necessary for their job,"Cashiers are rarely allowed to sit in grocery stores, and other retail jobs. Sitting might sometimes affect the ability to perform certain tasks, but cashiers can stand for these, if needed. But in my experience, most cashier duties involve scanning, hitting buttons, and putting things in bags. All of these can be performed while sitting.   

I believe there are work-culture reasons for requiring cashiers to stand that are not based on their ability to perform their job, but based on the ""perception"" of being less alert, or at worst, lazy.  

I do not think most customers care about these perceptions as much as managers and corporate leaders think they do. 

Not all cashiers will care about this, but there are enough cashiers that would greatly benefit from being allowed to sit for health reasons, and for morale reasons.

Reverse racism isn’t a thing.,"Nope, reverse racism doesn’t exist. In fact, those two words don’t really make sense together unless it means either not being racist at all or being racist to a racist.


So the idea is that if a person of any other race is racist towards a white person, they are committing reverse racism.


Makes sense right? Cause we all know white devils are the only ones who can truly say racial slurs, deny someone things based on the colour of their skin or hate someone of another race. 


NOPE. It’s actually quite ironic because being a racist is something open to literally anyone. If somebody discriminates somebody based on nothing but their skin colour, preaches hate towards a certain race/certain races, they are being racist, ONLY racist. 


I think the people who push the whole reverse thing are actually being racist towards white people, implying that white people are the only true racists. I feel that white people who use this term are virtue signaling to those who agree with the whole “white people are the problem” libotomised way of thinking.

"Christianity by itself is great for humanity, it’s only bad when people hijack it for selfish gain","I think the core tenets of Christianity have been great for humanity. Themes such as humility, non-violence, forgiveness, unconditional love, caring for the weak, being opposed to materialism. and self love. Yes I suppose this type of morality is possible without religion but it’s in my opinion it’s easier for people to truly believe these things if they are raised religious, as opposed to being raised an atheist which makes it more likely for one to become nihilistic.

Yes this is just an anecdote but in my small town there was no homeless shelter until the church built one. And I know in many other small towns, churches are the only place to turn if you have nowhere else to go. There are many non religious organizations in my town who never bothered to help the homeless at all.

Christianity has been used to manipulate the masses into countless wars and used as a tool of oppression but really this isn’t because of the teachings of Christianity but because of people who hijack it and use peoples faith for selfish reasons. There are many other righteous movements like BIm or Communism that were hijacked by bad people and led to murder and violence, does that mean the ideologies themselves are bad? No, just that people should be wary of blindly following dogmatic leaders. 


Which is part of why Martin Luther broke away from the church and believed all you need was to read the scripture yourself and have faith. Christianity can be good at the same time you can also hate the church.",v7y7fn,"I’m of the opinion that religion in general is a menace.

Mods and admins should (must) always justify locking a thread,"Pretty simple. As users of a public forum, it is only appropriate that before a thread is locked, a clear and rational reason be given to the locking of the thread. It takes very little effort to pin a comment, so that is no excuse. Flippant retorts and snide comments do not meet this criteria.

How many times have seemingly innocuous threads been locked for seemingly no reason? This is not helpful in curbing or growing a sub in the way the mods think is best. If a reason is at least given, people can learn how to better act in the community. It also increases transparency.",gvdk4r,"I'll take a stab at this point since I've been a user of Reddit for a while now, and a moderator for the last 6 or so months.   When a thread on a controversial or popular topic pops up a sort of negative bandwagon can ensue.    Along with people contributing to the discussion, a number of bad actors (mainly trolls/hate-filled individuals) will appear.  The more popular post, the worse it can get - particularly for controversial posts.  

Take a a hypothetical  example; let's say one out of a thousand (for argument's sake) Reddit users are trolls.   Then let's say the top post on Reddit for the day is seen by a few hundred thousand people.   Using the numbers I mentioned earlier, that would mean hundreds of trolls showing up; this can (and does) easily overwhelm the capacity of any moderation team.  Often the only way to handle it is to lock the thread until the fuss dies down or after a certain amount of time.  Worse case, advertising 'why' the lockdown happened might even be the kind of reaction the trolls are seeking.  

Now, let me share an actual example from this subreddit.  In the last couple of weeks, there was a post about Ben Shapiro's debating skills; it became highly visible.  I know I and other moderators had to lock the thread down on multiple occasions just to catch up with the necessary removals.   (The sheer number of people who felt the need to leave a variation of ""he's a master debator"" was mind-boggling.)    The flood of rule breaking comments swamped any genuine attempts at discussion.   CMV doesn't work without constant, ongoing moderation.  Worse, this same flood also hampered the usual moderation of the 'normal load' of rule-breaking comments in other posts simply do to the way the current moderation software works.  So, as a last resort, the post got locked.  

Everything I've described above applies to this one, not-particularly-large, subreddit.  I shudder to think of what can ensue with posts on controversial topics in the bigger former 'default' subreddits.    

In the end, what I'm saying is this:

*Locking a post is much akin to amputating a limb to save the rest of the patient.  Yes it can certainly be abused - but just sometimes, it is the only way to treat the patient.*",fsoj31x
God doesn't exist.,"I was raised Catholic and went to Christian school for 12 years. Eventually evidence convinced me that the Abrahamic god probably doesn't exist. Some would accuse me if being an agnostic, but I'd say I'm what Richard Dawkins refers to as a ""de facto atheist,"" or one who believes there's a very low likelihood for the existence of a god. Most, if not all, of my arguments are probably ones the layperson has heard, but I'm only trying to bring this question to the forefront, not radically revolutionize the landscape of this type of discussion.

1) The theories of abiogenesis are much more convincing to me than the creation story of the Bible. Nucleotides and polynucleotides form on their own in a lab when you mimic Earth's early atmosphere--also lipids and amino acids form on their own. Theorizing how this process could have gone about naturally to create the first ""proto cell"" is much more convincing to me than creationism.


2) Evolution directly contradicts the creationist text.


3) I'm much more convinced of the big bang than creationism. Believers in the Abrahamic god often say science claims something came from nothing. Realistically, big bang proponents assert that there was a singularity of all matter that exploded and remain agnostic on what took place before the big bang and where and how said matter originated. Theists also invoke a supremely complicated creator god while offering no explanation as to how said god came to be--sometimes using the copout of, ""God is eternal therefore he requires no creator.""


4) The jealous and vindictive god of the Bible resembles the state of humanity more than an all loving god.


5) The body is far from perfect --we get sick, cancer, our eyesight fails, we're sometimes born with deformities, our DNA is full of redundancy, et cetera. How could an all knowing god create us with such glaring mistakes?


6) I don't believe in free will, though that's a topic for another discussion. But not believing in free will, to me, throws out the notion of hell. For example, some people are ""evil"" because they were beaten and abused, and even subjected to the genes of a psychopath, and for those reasons they commit terrible crimes. Sure, we ought to detain anyone who's a threat to safety, but should they be subjected to eternal suffering? I don't think so. So there are people lucky enough to be born into a good hand, and others who are dealt a bad one, and one is more likely to go to heaven and the other to hell, respectively. That's justice?


7) There are thousands of gods, and I feel no compulsion to believe in any of them. I can't muster up faith that I don't have.


8) Why would an all loving god allow the Holocaust or other heinous events in history? Why would a baby be born with an incurable disease? ""God works in mysterious ways"" doesn't convince me.

I'm not necessarily looking for rebuttals to my 8 points, but feel free to if you're so inclined.",cy46dl,"I'd just like to answer your 2 first points because they represent a popular opinion that is a result of a misunderstanding.

The Bible is not meant to be taken literally. There's a reason why Bible is a subject of studies (theological and not). When it says that the God created earth in 7 days, it doesn't mean that earth was created in 168 of our earthly hours, it could mean that it was created in 7 thousands, millions or billions of years. It's written that way to be understandable for all people across history. 
Same goes with the creation of humans. 1 day might mean thousands of years of evolution. I'm a christian and I don't believe that God just snapped his fingers and created us. I understand the ""creation"" as a push for specific circumstances  so that our evolution could happen. 

Now you could say that it's just my understanding of christianity and that I'm using science to fit my beliefs, but I think that blindly following any religion is moronic and that anyone who wants to believe should constantly challenge their views with scientific discoveries",eyq6o2s
"anipulation is immoral, even if you're manipulating someone to do the ""right"" thing","I beleive that Manipulation is wrong. I also beleive that the classic ""guilt-trip"" is definitely a form of Manipulation.

I don't think people would generally disagree with the above, if you were talking about guilt-tripping people into doing something only you benefit from. E.g. If I was to use the fact that I am currently very sick, in order to push my brother into coming over and making good for me, I think most people would consider that immoral.

NOTE: I'm not saying it's on the same level as murder, assault, rape or anything like that of course, I don't even think it should be illegal. I'm just here to discuss the morality of the action, not the legality.

Where it gets sticky is when people are guilt-tripping someone to do what most people would see as the ""right thing"" to do. Using current affairs as an easy example, if you were to use the outbreak to guilt-trip someone into staying home (saying that they would be responsible for other people's death if they would not) most people would actually support you, agree with you and maybe even help you.

But I think both actions are immoral. Trying to manipulate someone is immoral no matter what your motivation is. I say this because, as soon as we say that ""Manipulation is immoral unless you're getting them to do the right thing"" you're opening yourself up to Manipulation for any purpose.

Essentially, I could argue that in the first case, I am not being immoral as I am sick and the ""right thing"" for my brother to do, is to look after me. Therefore I'm morally right to manipulate him into doing so.

Likewise, I could argue that in the second example, just because the majority deem something the ""right thing"" doesn't make it so and its immoral to imprison me if I have done nothing wrong and am not currently sick/infectious. 

NOTE: I wouldn't make that argument before anyone calls me an awful person, I'm just using two examples to illustrate my point.

TLDR: guilt-tripping someone is a form of Manipulation and all Manipulation is immoral regardless of whether you're trying to manipulate someone into doing what you think is the ""right thing"" to do.",fx1p9e,"Manipulation is a great parenting technique. I’m serious, I was never spanked or grounded as a child, my mother played on my guilt. I never wanted to hurt or disobey my parents because I knew I would feel awful about it.",fmtlzcb
Minecraft Java is better than Minecraft Bedrock,"INTRODUCTION

So, first of all, sorry for bad English, I may do some ortographical mistakes. Second, this is a personal view, if someone thinks that Bedrock is better than Java, I respect it. But personally I think that Java is better.

Now, here comes the arguments.

WHY I THINK JAVA IS BETTER THAN BEDROCK

1. Modifications

Let me explain. Minecraft Java's programming language is Java, while Bedrock is written in C++. Now C++ has some pros against Java, like the fact that it is better optimized (If you compare, Bedrock goes way more fluid than Java) but Java is like more open source, I mean, it is easier to learn and code in Java than in C++, and that leads to more and better mods. Now I think that mods are a huuuge part of minecraft, and mods in bedrock are made with Bedrock's official nodding API wich restricts some things. While in Java you can modify the whole game, in Bedrock you can't. Also, the fact that Bedrock has micro transactions annoys me. Like, you shouldn't pay for maps, skins and texture packs. Yes, you can always get them free in the internet, but it still annoys me.

2. The community

Java has got better servers, you can't deny that. Still, Bedrock is better for playing with your friends. The mayority of players in the Bedrock's community are actually 10 y/o kids, while most of the Java's community are more mature people. This is because Java is older than Bedrock.

This is getting longer than I expected.

3. The interface

I'm gonna say it clearly, I don't like bedrock interface. It's very strange. I prefer Java interface, overall the main screen. That's it. This one is shorter.

4. Conclusion (do you say it like that in English? I don't really know)

So, basically I prefer Java because of better mods and better servers. The fact that Bedrock is better optimized doesn't annoy me at all because I can always use mods like optifine, which also has other features, like Shaders and Dynamic Lighting. I particularly love Dynamic Lightning. I mean, I can have a torch in my off-hand (oops, I forgot to mention that) and a nodded Desert Eagle in my main hand and go ahead and explore the darkest caves (there is a pretty cool mod that reduces minimum lighting, so if you don't have torches at night/closed spaces all you see is pitch black). You can't do that in Bedrock, you know.",gkxmr4,"Generally I prefer Java, but bedrock does provide one or two unique features. An example is native support for 3D headsets via occulus rift .",fqtywiy
Children under the age of 15 in the United States should not be allowed to participate in protests.,"Formatting: I’m on mobile. I’m going to split this up to be minimal yet get my point across.

1.	It is dangerous. 
• Protesting can be dangerous. I’m not insinuating every protest turns into a riot, but mass amounts of people heated about one topic in particular (to the point of taking to the streets) can be dangerous, especially for a child - someone who is physically smaller and potentially unfamiliar with the area. Not to fall into a slippery slope, but it is inherent there will be more predators at these events as there is simply more people in general.

2.	You are not allowing them to form their own opinions.
• If any person, especially a child, who is so easily influenced, is on the fence about a particular topic, an event like a protest could have long term effects on their belief, simply due to the occasion and not due to their actual belief on the topic. Let me give an *extreme* example just to paint the picture.. if they attend an anti gun rally, and a bad guy brings a gun but is subsequently taken out by a good guy, that one event could change this persons perception. This might not always be bad, but I worry it could be. 

3.	It provides more weight during time of great unrest
• This is kind of playing both sides of the field - if children under age 15 were forbidden to protest, and then something unruly happens in politics and the street floods with children protesting (who are supposed to be banned from doing so), the impact and significance of having literal children protest would speak volumes. Still trying to change my view? Prohibition works, just in the opposite way as intended. See what I’m getting at?

4.	The bigger picture
This is strictly opinion, and I’m absolutely certain a significant amount of people will disagree - but I find it to be generally distasteful when I see a kid, roughly age 8-12, spouting random political info obtained from their parents, even if it’s aligned with my views. Pictures of presidents with a group of kids decked out in political attire (no memes, please) is just... gross. Why is a 10 year old having a political photo shoot with a 2nd term president? (Note: That was not a specific example, just yanking). 

5.	Why 15?
• 15 puts a legal child within 3 years of voting. Several prominent political positions are term limited to 3 years, meaning a 15 year old could protest an elected official at 15 (or campaign for them, I guess, even though 3 years is a long campaign) and vote them out (or in) at 18. 15 is a sweet spot where I know I had my own political opinions formed (and would’ve felt comfortable at a protest), but I had friends who couldn’t name the most recent former president. 

There you have it. Change my mind.",h9i5r5,"&gt;Protesting can be dangerous. I’m not insinuating every protest turns into a riot, but mass amounts of people heated about one topic in particular (to the point of taking to the streets) can be dangerous, especially for a child - someone who is physically smaller and potentially unfamiliar with the area.

I don't see how this could be different from banning taking children into public, where any disaster could happen at any moment e.g. a terrorist attack, kidnapping, etc. A lot of cities at night are more dangerous for children than any protest.

&gt;If any person, especially a child, who is so easily influenced, is on the fence about a particular topic, an event like a protest could have long term effects on their belief, simply due to the occasion and not due to their actual belief on the topic.  

So should we ban all exposure of politics to children?

&gt;This is kind of playing both sides of the field - if children under age 15 were forbidden to protest, and then something unruly happens in politics and the street floods with children protesting (who are supposed to be banned from doing so), the impact and significance of having literal children protest would speak volumes. 

The impact of children protesting already speaks volumes in our society. See: Greta Thunberg

The bigger picture
&gt;This is strictly opinion, and I’m absolutely certain a significant amount of people will disagree - but I find it to be generally distasteful when I see a kid, roughly age 8-12, spouting random political info obtained from their parents, even if it’s aligned with my views.

I disdain an uninformed populace as much as you do, but we all have to start somewhere. Give them time to grow, man.

Overall, limiting who can and cannot participate in the right to peaceful assembly is a dangerous precedent for any government.",fuwvst5
Silver money has more upsides than downsides,"Almost all money used to be silver (or gold), but it's not anymore. But it had a lot of upsides that we're missing out on today.

* Silver is a potent antimicrobial, and would keep our money clean and our society healthier. [Silver is such a good antimicrobial that settlers would put silver coins in their milk to make it last significantly longer.](https://www.thriftyfun.com/tf47824676.tip.html#:~:text=Tip%3A%2099.9%25%20Silver%20to%20Keep%20Milk%20and%20Water%20Fresh&amp;text=The%20pioneers%20who%20traveled%20west,keep%20the%20milk%20fresh%20longer.)
* It's hard to counterfeit. That's because the value of the coin comes from the silver content itself - if you were to counterfeit a coin out of silver, it would still be valuable - since it would be made of silver! And it's easy to tell if a coin isn't real silver with a few basic tests anyone can do at home.
* It would create a lot of jobs in the mining industry.
* The money itself would be more resistant to physical damage. If you rip a dollar bill in half, you just lost your money. But if you (somehow) manage to break a silver dollar in half - it's still valuable. Even if you melt it back down, it would hold roughly the same value as before you damaged it.
* The OGs endorsed it. The Framers of the US Constitution had just financed the Revolutionary War by using Continental Dollars - a paper currency which they printed into oblivion to pay for the war. Their dollar failed due to hyperinflation, and everyone's savings went kaput. So they wrote that wisdom they gained directly into the Constitution, Article 10 Section 1:

&gt;No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; **make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts;**

* It keeps prices low and stops inflation from eroding away the minimum wage. Every few years we have a new debate about minimum wage because of inflation. People suffer while waiting for that debate to conclude. We're all getting tired of that repetitious debate. [But old silver coins *still* hold their value to this day.](https://schiffgold.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/lates-sign.jpg) All other things being equal, if we had never taken the silver out of our coins, and we left the minimum wage untouched since the 60s, leaving it at $1.25, the minimum wage would equal a modern value of ~$27.


That being said, I am aware there are downsides. It's heavy. Industry uses silver in electronics. Vending machine manufacturers would need to update their equipment.

But my view is the upsides outweigh the downsides and switching to silver money would benefit our society in all sorts of ways, ranging all the way from public health to counterfeit prevention to economic safety nets for our minimum wage earners.",n5vk7w,"1. Copper is antimicrobial and much cheaper, we can just make our coins out of it. 

2. Counterfeiting is not a significant problem in 2021 due to better technology + digital money. 

3. This silver wouldn’t be coming from America, it would be coming from the world’s #1 producer, Mexico. Cartels would cash in on it just like they’re doing with avocados. 

4.  We shouldn’t base our economic system on the habits of idiots who rip dollar bills in half. 

5. The 1700s were a very different time. 

6. [US Inflation rate over time.](https://imgur.com/a/4h1mPZb) Much more stable when not tied to gold/silver. 

Some huge downsides: 

1. The majority of produced silver currently goes to industrial uses. It’s bad to take a huge amount of silver out of industry so everyone can carry around silver they’re not even using industrially. 

2. The size of the economy should not be limited by how much silver the country has. Fiat currency is much better because it allows a country to expand its economy based on how productive it is, not how much shiny metal is in its vaults. 

3. This would cause severe deflation which destroys the economy by discouraging spending/encouraging hoarding. See the Panic of 1819 for a real example of this happening.",gx3m8xl
"If you say you need to be true to yourself, you're doomed for unhappiness when it comes to relationships.","I have a good friend who lacks compassion.  He insists he needs to be true to himself and do what he feels right, even if it means the woman he loves might be repeatedly unhappy with his actions and leave him.  He is unable to see that in order for good relationships to prosper, each party needs to be heard and open to one another's perspectives, even if they might not agree.  

If he had compassion, he could weigh the needs of his girlfriend and his own, then try to incorporate them both into his actions.  

I get that it's important to act true to yourself when making solitary decisions.  

Once you're in a committed relationship, for someone to say they need to be true to themselves, it becomes a one-sided argument.

Gun rights advocation and Back the Blue are antithetical ideologies,"Many gun rights advocates believe that prevalent firearms contribute to a safer society. Many guns rights advocates also support the police in light of BLM protests and frequent police brutality events. I believe that these 2 beliefs are incompatible with each other. Widespread availability of all types of firearms makes police work even more dangerous than it already is. Supporting the police should include gun control that would result in safer working conditions for police. This also works with BLM as well. One reason there have been such problems with police brutality is police training regarding gund. They have to constantly be on guard for suspects with firearms. This leds to tense interactions and misread situations. When police act in fear of their own lives, violence is much more likely to occur. Without potential firearms in the equation, the police could have more relaxed interactions and de-escalation would be easier. For reference, I own firearms that I use for hunting and I have police officers in my immediate family. I also live outside of Boulder, which is why the thought came up.",mbqnro,"I believe there needs to be better police training criminals will obtain guns illegally regardless and there will always be criminals due to many circumstances that will most likely never be stopped like drugs,gangs, black market etc. more training in ethics, and elite skill training I don’t necessarily believe more education is needed just more elite type training police is a serious job and should be treated like that and they should get the pay they deserve for that.",grzpwbe

A bigger budget isn't going to fix the education problems in the US.,"I believe that the problems experienced in the education system(especially in the US) are not from a lack of funding. The USA spends more money on education than almost any other developed country, yet we score poorly in comparison. While I think the issue of poor education outcome is a complex issue that does not have a singular cause I would like to discuss three major issues that a bigger budget will not fix.

The current school system does not cultivate a good learning environment: 
The current system is too structured. It tries to fit all kids into the same box and doesn't recognize that some are naturally better at certain things while worse in other areas. Usually if a kid is bad at math or spelling they are told they aren't studying hard enough. This along with the fact that many high schools in america start to early for teenagers makes it difficult for kids to stay engaged.

Passion needs to be prioritized in teaching:
 Public school teachers make more than private schools teachers, yet students from private schools consistently score better than those from public schools and the student group that scores the highest are those that are home schooled. I believe this discrepancy ultimately comes down to passion. If teachers doesn't have passion and can't instill a passion to learn among their students, then its going to be difficult for students to pay attention.

Expectations need to be achievable and reasonable:
While it is a very good thing to challenge oneself and always strive to be the best version of yourself that you can be, every young person in society needs to understand that most kids grow up to live average lives. Telling kids that they can grow up to be anyone or do anything can form unrealistic expectations for kids and can form feelings of inadequacy later in life or even on tests when they don't live up to a certain standard.",usrzfx,"As others have noted elsewhere, you seem to leave out parental involvement out. That appears to be a great predictor in education.

Caveat for below feedback: I am taking what you wrote as fact, even though there are no citations of any information on which you base your conclusions.

&gt; The current school system does not cultivate a good learning environment

It seems that your argument is that the current K-12 curriculum (the required part) is too difficult/advanced to be required of every student.

&gt; Passion needs to be prioritized in teaching

Why is it that home schooled kids score better than private schooled kids and those score better than public schooled kids? If parents are home schooling their kids, it sounds like parents and not a ""stranger"" are the ones that provide that passion you mention. As for private schooled kids, what kinds of incomes do they tend to be from? It seems that the more involved/invested parents are in their child's education, the higher the test scores.

&gt; Expectations need to be achievable and reasonable

You are conflating what is possible (can be) with what is certain (will be). If you keep telling someone that they will amount to being nothing more than a low skill manual laborer, don't be surprised that they don't become a rocket scientist. The whole point on getting kids to apply themselves and showing them that they are capable of something more is how you get them to actually reach that.",i96hq3i
Pete Buttigieg is gaslighting Democratic voters with his Medicare For All Who Want It plan,"Buttigieg's campaign is blasting Warren and Sanders with his campaign rhetoric that they want to take away the freedom of choice of voters with respect to their health care. 

This is a lie. Medicare For All leaves the choice of health care provider with the patient. It only takes away the choice of which entity which pays the provider. 

I'd you go to the doctor or have a hospital visit, who really cares which entity is paying the bill?

Why is that an important issue of freedom? 

If MFA provides enhanced coverage including vision, hearing and dental at a lower cost than current standards which eliminates employer dependency, who would logically choose private health insurance? 

The powerful opponents of MFA include corporate health insurers and big pharma as well as corporate media which receives billions in their advertising and politicians 
who are big recipients of campaign contributions and lobbying gigs after retirement.",dxb9z9,"I don't like Buttigeg (as a candidate; he seems like a great person), and won't be voting for him in the primary. So I promise I'm not just out here defending my guy. 

But a true Medicare-for-all, abolish-private-insurance system would be such an enormous and unprecedented change to our healthcare that I don't think anyone really knows what all the impacts would be. It might, in fact, reduce the choices that many people can make with respect to their healthcare. That's not an unreasonable concern, even if you wholly support MFA. One major difference between the US and other countries' systems is that patients in the US get far MORE treatment than they would otherwise get in another country (arguably, unnecessary treatment). 

But maybe he's wrong. In fact, let's stipulate that he's wrong. 

Is he... ""gaslighting?"" I don't think so. 

I mean are Sanders and Warren ""gaslighting"" us by claiming they are going to pass a Medicare-for-all system? There is absolutely no chance that they are going to do that. 

It's just politics. It's hardly about what they actually think they could accomplish if they won. Their ability to accomplish things will be much more modest and a function of many things now unknown. They're just trying to tell the voters something about what they value and prioritize and how they see the world.",f7ow4d3
It is better to FADE AWAY than to BURN OUT,"Contrary to the popular notion, I think it is vastly better to fade away than to burn out. I will be looking at this sentiment mostly through the lens of rock music.

First, let us remember that the man who coined/popularized the phrase, Neil Young, did not actually burn out, but quite the opposite. He faded away from the public eye for ten or so years, only to make a glorious comeback in the 90s, and slowly faded away again. The man is still active, although he has not made any big impact records for some time. His life and career is an antithesis to what he sang about. Do we think less of him because he kept on going? No.

And I am glad he did not burn out. We would have missed a lot of great music otherwise. Sure, he made some shitty records in the 80s, but if he had died or retired in 1979, he would not have gotten Freedom or Harvest Moon. And the good records are vastly more important than the bad ones. We can always ignore the bad stuff and choose not to listen to it, as most people do. But we cannot make non-existent good stuff real.

If an old artist comes up with even one good song for every ten bad songs he makes, that is a good deal for us as listeners, for that is still one good song more than what we would have gotten had he burned out. Not to mention all the great comeback albums, like The Rising or All You Can't Leave Behind or Permanent Vacation, that come out of years of rut. 

*What if the artist never makes a good record again?* Well, who cares? We are free to ignore their more recent stuff and even make our own head canon. The Who still exists, the band who sang *I hope I die before I get old*. Have they made anything relevant since 1978? Not really. Do you care? Probably not. I still love them for what they did in 1965-1978. People tend to focus on the good times anyway and cut off wherever they wish.

*How about bands like the Beatles? They burned out and they are iconic.* I do not think there is any Beatles fan out there who never wished that they had stuck together and made more music. The individual members surely did make some great tunes later, and then they faded away (besides maybe John).

*But if the Beatles had stuck together, maybe their next records would have been not-so-good, or even bad?* And so what? Look at their peers, the Rolling Stones. Is Satisfaction any lesser song or Beggars Banquet any lesser album because Bridges to Babylon exists? Is their 1968-1972 run any less legendary because they are still together? Besides, if the Rolling Stones had burned out by 1973, we would have never gotten Some Girls or Tattoo You.

After all, what is a burn out worth? What does anyone get from it? What we got from the deaths of Jimi Hendrix or Jim Morrison or Kurt Cobain or John Lennon? Whatever that is, is it worth more than those people, your idols, living, even if they never made music again?

I want to also point out that those that wish their favourite bands had burned out, instead of faded away, they are always doing it retroactively, when they can subjectively decide when that band was past their prime. But at the moment, who can say what can happen? Maybe their next album is Face Dances or it could be Kid A. Maybe it sucks, but maybe the album ten years from now will rock.

Lastly, I want to end with a quote from John Lennon himself, commenting on what Neil Young sang about:

&gt;I hate it. It's better to fade away like an old soldier than to burn out. If he was talking about burning out like Sid Vicious, forget it. I don't appreciate the worship of dead Sid Vicious or of dead James Dean or dead John Wayne. It's the same thing. Making Sid Vicious a hero, Jim Morrison – it's garbage to me. I worship the people who survive – Gloria Swanson, Greta Garbo. (--) I don't want Sean worshiping John Wayne or Johnny Rotten or Sid Vicious. What do they teach you? Nothing. Death. Sid Vicious died for what? So that we might rock? I mean, it's garbage you know. If Neil Young admires that sentiment so much, why doesn't he do it? Because he sure as hell faded away and came back many times, like all of us. No, thank you. I'll take the living and the healthy.",jv554b,"If you have already done your magnum opus, what is there left? You become a sell out and just do poor songs for the money. This makes older songs worse because they lose their integrity.

When someone says ""this band is awesome"" and you listen to their newest piece (because assumption new is more refined and better) that's not so awesome you will never know the truth.

When you ask ""who cares"", its the people not going to bands concerts and start to dislike them because they are sell outs. They stop listening all together.

Porn has the potential to create same-sex/bicurious sexual tendencies within someone.,"I personally think that porn, with enough amount of consumption, depending on what content they look at, can start to make an individual think that they want to do sexual things with the same gender, be it a woman with a woman or a man with a man.

I used to consume porn but have stopped because of this exact reason and I highly doubt it has anything to do a person's sexual orientation. Every time porn was consumed the ""tendency/urge"" was there however when porn isn't consumed, none of those thoughts come across my mind, I would only think of the opposite sex. I have consumed porn ever since I was 14 and these same-sex sexual urges had never popped up until I hit about 20. I wouldn't find the man emotionally or sexually attractive but rather the genital.

 I believe porn can convince a man with enough consumption that serving a penis sexually is what gets them off.  


Change my view.",d16714,"Your initial post doesn't specify, but do you mean just porn in general? If a man or woman watches content in which the same equipment doesn't appear (a woman watching gay porn or a man watching lesbian porn) that they would still start to think they want to try things with the same sex? And just vanilla straight stuff as well?",ezhunf6
The hatred towards Hillary Clinton is unwarranted,"I don't understand it to be honest with you. It seems both on both the right and left (especially the right) they simply despise her. What is it about her that people hate so much? She seems like a very intelligent lady who has spent decades in politics. She typically has very reasoned approaches to her arguments and this is coming from someone who is a conservative. I get the email thing but was it seriously THAT bad? I mean, there are so many other politicans who have done worse and are not nearly as hated (especially when considering people like Trump). Compared to hillary, her husband, who straight up cheated on her, is miles ahead in likability by the American public. Why is that? I think it is kind of unfair to be honest with you.",j70o9o,"Clinton is an intelligent person who seems like a decent leader and listener.

BUT

She's very unlikeable to most people, and far inferior as a politician to her husband.

She and the Clinton foundation are very embroiled in corruption scandals, people can easily point to her connections as being part of the establishment.

Bad policy during Clinton/Obama that people felt (like NAFTA and Tough on Crime bills) that people associated to her for being in the administration but give a pass to Bill/Obama due to their personal charisma.

She's bad at expressing herself in front of a crowd, she's quite robotic and relies too much on planned phrases. This makes her come off as cold and not genuine and dishonest.

Republicans are very good at hit jobs and PR and hammered her on scandals most Americans don't understand (emails, Benghazi). To be sure, they weren't wrong, those were scandals, but they weren't any worse than what most other politicians do.

TLDR: she deserves the hate, but so do plenty of other politicians so I don't think she in particular deserves to be singled out as being uniquely bad in any way.",g82oz7c
There is no such thing as unnatural.,"There is no supernatural or unnatural. There is only nature, it’s unfoldment, and our judgments of it.

Everything that is, is within the natural process. We are nature itself, in its full expression. There is nothing unnatural about us, unless we can claim to know the plan of nature, and exactly how we have deviated from it. 

Nature is indifferent to our understanding of it. It cannot be defined by the limitations of our attempts to describe it. 

If the supernatural is what lies beyond the bounds of what can be scientific known, then this would only demonstrate the constraints of scientific inquiry.

The ugly and beautiful, the good and the bad. These are merely human judgments of nature. Any aversions we may feel towards certain aspects of nature are of no consequence to the process itself. If there is a course of nature then we are surely ignorant of its trajectory. Therefore we cannot claim anything to be unnatural, because we do not know what nature intended.

Edit: Just citing the standard definition of unnatural is not going to convince me, unfortunately. That would be too easy. You’re going to have to explain exactly how it is that we should know what to expect to occur naturally, and precisely why we, our behaviours, tools, and our technologies, should be considered deviant from the natural process.",uuyqsq,"&gt;thing as unnatural.

There are two definitions of 'Communism' and as a result when people critique communism they more often then not are attacking something that communists do not support,"When communism is brought up the biggest issue in having a conversation about it is that there are two very different things represented by one word.

Some will refer to the USSR, China, Vietnam, and such countries as communist, others would argue that they aren't communist as they don't meet the standards.

What has become abundantly clear to me is that these two sides both see communism as a different thing.

1. Your average person who has not done any research on Marxism or communism might call it this: **""When the government controls everything, when there are gulags, when you can't own things, when everyone is absolutely equal except for the leaders who are rich""**
2. Someone who is a communist, or at least understands basic Marxism would go with the original definition of **""A stateless and monetarily classless society in which the community as a whole owns the means of production""**

As a result of this, when people critique communism, there is a good chance that what they are talking about is something that no communist would support or admit as communism.

So almost all discussions about communism can get no where as a supporter of communism may often spend most of his time just informing the other person that what they believe is communism is not actually what they support or what Marx or Engels defined.

&amp;#x200B;

And this is why there is so much confusion surrounding the topic of communism

the best way to fix the injustice in US court systems is to make the victim and the accused person anonymous to the judge and jury.,"CMV: People say justice is blind, but for some people, that doesn’t seem to be the case. Discrimination based on appearance and gender can often distort justice and harm the nation as a whole.
As such, the best way to combat this discrimination is to not let the judge know anything about these people other than the crimes they may or may not have committed and the evidence for and against it. The judge should not know the appearance, gender, or any other physical trait except for injuries relevant to the crime. Of course they would still have access to criminal records, but those should also have names and photos redacted for the purpose of judging them in a new trial. 
As such, a new anonymous form of justice would be the best way of determining how our society gets justice for its victims and it’s falsely accused.",fx2i53,"This is using a wrecking ball to kill a fly.

In the attempt to stop discrimination, we would seriously damage the entirety of court procedures.  Juries and judges would be operating in a vacuum, in a sterile environment devoid of any human presence.  No victims would be seen, no one would be testifying in person since they too would have to be anonymized to prevent prejudice.

Juries would sit and read text statements, or listen to robotic recreation of voices designed to remove all identity.  They would have blurred out photographs and video to look out, with sound removed, and be assured by lawyers that behind the blur, witness X and defendant Y were surely there.

How would a jury member be able to trust that this censored, edited, sanitized version of events they were being presented was in any way accurate?

Religion is man made and most likely entirely fictitious,"The entire concept of a written book that god sent down to a human being to spread the word does not make sense to me. A being that has the ability to create the universe, has a son that’s major power is water to wine and walking on water, and was crucified by humans. How do we even know this man existed? Language is man made, and only understood by certain people so it’s an unfair advantage that some get to understand it and others don’t ... what about the people who are never exposed to religion in their lives? How can we live based on a book written thousands of years ago... that you have to actively try to understand and decode. I’d assume God’s message would be more understandable and direct to each being, not the local priest who’s essentially an expert at deflecting and making up explanations using the scripture. 

I grew up in a religious Muslim family and being religious for 16 years made me a better person. I lived as if I was being watched and merited based on my good behaviours so I obviously actively did “good” things. I appreciate the person religion has made me but I’ve grown to believe it is completely fabricated - but it works so people go with it. The closest thing to a “god” I can think of is a collective human consciousness and the unity of all humankind... not a magic man that’s baiting you to sin and will torture you when you do. I mean the latter is more likely to prevent you from doing things that may harm you.. I would like to raise my kids in future the way I was raised but I don’t believe in it and I don’t want to lie and make them delusional. 

I kind of wish I did believe but it’s all nonsensical to me, especially being a scientist now it seems pretty clear it’s all bs.

A suit and tie is not necessary (and should even be discouraged) to wear to work.,"First, just to get this out of the way: If you love wearing a suit &amp;tie because it makes you feel confident, helps you focus, it's comfortable to you, or any other reason that benefits you: that's great. Not saying you should be banned from wearing something that looks good on you and makes you feel good. Second, my personal perspective is that of a gay, lower middle class, white man who works as a social worker, but who has also worked in oil and gas, architecture, and other ""corporate"" environments as well as service industries. 

Certain professions require specific clothing for safety (examples: construction workers may need a hard hat, surgeons should wear gowns/gloves/masks, etc.). Besides this, requiring that certain items of clothing be worn in order to appear ""work appropriate"" is an outdated, uncomfortable, disrespectful, and even oppressive idea. Why should anyone be required to wear something like a suit and tie to work? If you have to sit at a desk all day and are required to wear something with a collar, tucked into slacks, and leather shoes, what is the benefit to this uniform? 

These types of clothing are typically uncomfortable. Wear a pair of leather oxfords for 10-12 hours without taking them off one day and then wear a pair of sneakers for the same time the next; what do you think will feel better? And if you don't think comfort should be considered,  what do you think is better for your feet? I understand the idea is that businesses want to maintain the appearance of ""professionalism"". But is the current standard of what is ""professional"" still necessary? Many wildly successful tech companies are notorious for having casual attire as a standard for its employees. The lack of employees wearing a silk noose did not get in the way of their exponential successes. 

Beyond that, and this is where I feel I might lose some of you, I don't believe I'm the only person who can make a connection between the ""ideal"" of a suit &amp; tie, and the influence of classism, sexism, colonialism, and other outdated ideals such as meritocracy and conspicuous consumption. 

We can already see some movement in what women wear to work. Women aren't necessarily expected wear leather heels, a wool-blend jacket, or a blouse buttoned to the neck anymore. Women can wear clothing that is best suited to the weather if the want. In comparison, even at a not-for-profit where my clients were typically very low-income, I've been told that wearing navy dress shorts was not appropriate for work in 30+ degree weather (Celsius).  

Finally - I am not advocating for wearing pajamas, sweatpants, or slippers to the office. But one thing working from home during the Covid-19 pandemic has confirmed is that wearing these types of clothing while working doesn't prohibit someone from doing a good job when their job is just sitting at a computer. I get that there's got to be some minimum requirement. But I believe we have a lot of room between that minimum and the suit and tie.",o8p74m,How is meritocracy outdated.

Our goals, values, personalities, chemistry, and priorities mesh in such a way that we're aligned in every way you mentioned and I can't imagine anything ever changing.

Better funding for education is the most assured way to combat many issues in society,"Climate Change, viruses, social inequality, if we don’t have the resources or ideas to solve these issues now, then we should be preparing a citizenry that is better educated, one that knows how to better gather resources and solve issues. We need mass education initiatives to be strongly funded.

Some argue that throwing money at educational institutions and departments won’t solve education issues because ultimately what we have is a mismanagement of funds. I agree that there is some mismanagement of funds (as someone who has seen it first hand) and that we need to think of ways to solve this issue as well, but the more institutions have at their disposal, the more that will inevitably make its way into improving education. And who’s to say that it wouldn’t also result in administrations that better know how to manage money? It just seems to me that no matter how you look at these situations, education is at the center or foundation of making long term progress on many issues.

Edit: So because of some of the comments, I do have to modify my position. Ultimately, what I am concerned with is our attitude toward education as a society and the political actions we take because of that attitude. I do want education to be better funded and think it could fix some of the issue we complain about, but the reality is that probably won't happen until out perspectives about education change. 

Also to clarify, yes, I really think that certain things should be taught in school  and I'm unabashed about that at this point. I do agree with scientists and academics on any issue I take the time to study, so I think we should teach that, and I don't think parents, in an ideal world, should have the right to deny their child that information. Also, I think teaching students *how* to think will lead them to those conclusions themselves anyway, and again, parents shouldn't be allowed to deny their parents this type of education. It does seem to me that facts have a liberal bias; overall though many groups of people, including liberals, have their issues, and we'd be better off if we could agree on what experts agree on. That being said, I am not in as much fear about what giving educational institutions more power would do as someone who is apart of this group and think those who want to spin some conspiracy are doing so with a bad understanding of epistemology or in bad faith, so your chances of convincing me that my colleagues and I have some type of nefarious agenda to make a bunch of robots like us or some other such non-sense are very low.",d8ap0c,"in NJ, one of the last things our ex-Governer Christie did is to reverse the school funding.

For over a decade, schools in inner cities were getting tons more funding than suburban schools. After a report came out that revealed that despite the extra funding, kids from those school districts still sucked and did badly on tests, Christie reevaluated the funding and said there would be no more special treatment since throwing money at the problem for over 10 years has produced no results. He rebalanced the funding and those suburban schools whose kids (and parents of those kids) placed a high value on education got the extra funding they were lacking.

Those are all districts with mostly poor black kids who believe in a culture that says doing well in school is ""acting white"" and hustlin', slinging drugs and running in gangs is ""cool"" and ""manly"".

"""personhood"" and its associated rights exist in degrees, or with unique qualities.","I don't see personhood as a dichotomous thing - ""you are or you aren't."" To me, it's about the rights that apply to a *Homo sapiens* individual based on mental capacities. A zygote, though a member of the human species, does not deserve a right to bodily autonomy, as it has no sense of self or ability to choose - *it doesn't even have a nervous system* \- and it especially doesn't have a degree of this right that supersedes a mother's right to a certain quality of life.

For example, a sixteen-year-old, pregnant child shouldn't have her life ruined by being forced to carry a pregnancy to term when the child hasn't reached a certain developmental milestone. (However, I'm still trying to figure out what that point should be.)

Another example is a patient in a vegetative state. A family does not have a duty to go into financial ruin from paying to keep a brain-dead human on life support.

"The phrase ""10-fold"" means 1024x, not 10x","A lot of times I will hear somebody say ""tenfold"" to mean that something became ten times greater. For example, ""the drug increases your risk of death tenfold.""

But think about what you're saying. If you wanted to say 10 times, you should have just said 10 times. But you said 10 fold.

Imagine you had a piece of paper and you folded it 10 times. Ten folds. That would mean that every time you fold it over itself, it gets twice as big. So the first fold, it gets 2x bigger. Then on the next fold, it's 4x it's original width. Then 8x, 16x, 32x... and so on to 1024x at the 10th fold.

In the literal sense, that's what it means. It's like when people say ""I could care less"" - they think they're saying one thing, but the literal words that have escaped their mouth simply mean something else.

Plus I think it is simply useful to have the word ""fold"" in this context for when you need to refer to ridiculously large increases but saying the entire number would be unfathomable.

You could say, ""the universe quickly expanded after the Big Bang, increasing in size by six quadrillion, two hundred trillion, three hundred billion, five hundred million, eighty six thousand and one times"" or you could just say ""the universe expanded 52 fold.""

Rockstar's strict and limited mission design ultimately leads to what game they're trying to make that much better,"Rockstar have been criticized for their limited and strict mission design, where you're set a specific destination, where if you go even a fraction outside of the predetermined trail, you fail the mission.

This adds to the story and characters, as the character you're playing as will have established quirks of what they do or a pre-established moral code, and how the other characters bounce off of that.

This strict way of going about missions allows you to follow these character's stories and personality traits. It lets you properly explore their mindset and not the players. It allows for better storytelling and dialogue, which in Rockstar's case, allows for me and others to nearly uncontrollably sob at the end of chapter 6 in RDR2. In other words, great writing that makes us understand and bond with these characters. You couldn't get that as much with games that let you do whatever the fuck you desire with the story. Breath Of The Wild, for example, which many people say is better than RDR2 because of freedom. Link is a blank slate. There's no reason to get attached to the story, because most of the characters are quickly left aside for the gameplay. Which is why BOTW's way of doing things works, because it's made for that reason, freedom and gameplay. Rockstar's approach is to explore the themes of the story, explore the characters, and to make a great story with the missions.

"Using the 'Common Era' year count as a general calendar system is dishonest, and doesn't solve the problem.","Yeah, I know this topic has come up here a few times before, but I couldn't find many recent posts so i thought I might as well bring it up again.

The common era is a calendar system that is, in principle, the same as the Christian one. All years and divisions of months, weeks and days are the exact same. The only difference is that one uses BCE (Before Common Era) and CE (Common Era) instead of BC (Before Christ) or AD (Anno Domini). Though I understand the need for a more general year count, I don't think simply changing the letters after the year is really a solution. It seems like a very lazy attempt to make it more PC.

The common era doesn't remove the Christian connection, it merely hides it a bit. Once someone asks what the year 1 is based on, the whole jigg is up. And no, I don't think that saying it is arbitrary is an honest answer. It is clearly based on the Christian year count, which is based on the supposed birth of Jesus. So, in essence, it still holds the same religious connotation but it doesn't admit to it. In this way it is being dishonest about being less religious, it is only marginally better by removing the direct reference to Christ. But the indirect reference is still clearly there.

Furthermore, I think the name 'Common Era' is also just kind of... uncreative? There really isn't a better name they could've came up with? It is just the era that is... common to all of us? Not really, it is only common because it is the same as the Christian one, which is (correct me if I'm wrong) the most commonly used year count. Don't other cultures still have to convert their calendar into the 'common' one? It really is only easy for those already familiar with the Christian calendar. This can even be interpreted offensively, since apparently the Christian year count is common to all of humanity, including the majority non-Christian part? Doesn't that seem like the West is suppressing the rest of the world into using their system, by making theirs the common one?

Creating a new calendar system that actually solves this issue is a tremendous undertaking and would probably not be worth it. First of, what could possibly be the most inclusive way to choose the starting year? There aren't a whole lot of specific events that connect the majority of humanity. Secondly, it would mean that every existing dating system would constantly have to be converted from the local system to the general one. This is not even mentioning the year divisions into months, days etc. Why not change the name of the month July so it doesn't refer to a Roman emperor? Or the day Thursday so it doesn't refer to a Norse god? The list goes on.

So, in conclusion: trying to make a *truly* general calendar system is difficult if not impossible, and also quite silly. The common era is not a good solution at all, it merely shoves the problem under a rug and doesn't even address all the issues. Instead of pretending to be so secular we could also just keep using our own systems and acknowledge that other cultures date things differently. Is that practical? Perhaps not so much, but at least we are not pretending to be inclusive and secular when we really aren't.

Massive EDIT:

I've gone through all the current comments (yes, all, though replying to each would take too much time sadly) and gave it some more thought. I suppose that in the end it doesn't matter much whether CE or AD is used, since they are so similar. It is exactly because they are similar that it even works. Many people are already familiar with the Christian calendar, and thus have grown to accept it. With the Christian annotations out of the way, at least we have some sort of general dating system, though obviously not flawless in its origin.

I'm still a bit iffy about having a common calendar and basing it entirely on an existing one. But that is merely because it happens to be the most popular one. It is a rather minor issue in the grand scheme of things. I guess a part of me wanted a calendar with a starting point on a specific event that could tie humanity together. But I suppose there has been no such event. And even if there were, integrating this new calendar system in society would be huge undertaking and there is no telling whether it will even be succesful or worth it. CE will have to do, at least for now.

I already made the segway into language somewhere in the comments, but I will briefly post it here. I think something quite similar is going on in the development of a common language, namely English. It has become the dominant language on the internet and international affairs. There have been efforts to construct a new unbiased and culturally neutral language, like Esperanto for example. These have not been widely adopted however. English, despite its many flaws, has persisted for similar reasons the Christian calendar has. Perhaps some day it will truly be renamed into something like 'common tongue' like the Christian calendar was. Don't know how I feel about that, but I'll likely be long gone by then.

I hope this somewhat clarifies my new understanding. I'm not totally unboard the CE thing, but I think if found a comfortable middle ground. I'd like to thank the people that took their time to reply to this post. I won't really be responding anymore except if someone comes with a very different interesting point of view.",dr1p9s,"&gt; And no, I don't think that saying it is arbitrary is an honest answer.

The Gregorian calendar was adopted worldwide because it brought convenience in international trade to those who did. It is in everyone's best interest that there be a common calendar, to facilitate communication, travel, trade etc. For all I care, it could have just as well have been a different system that won. The important thing is that we all share a common one for certain purposes. Some countries are using two (or more?) calendar systems in parallel for cultural purposes, and that's fine too.

Insisting on calling it Before/After Christ doesn't really add any benefits, but has the effect of alienating/others those who do not believe in the Christian (and related) religions or the historical accuracy of the Bible.",f6dya3a
Organ Donation Should Be Automatic,"Short but sweet argument. In my state, Pennsylvania, you have to check a box when getting a driver’s license to be an organ donor. Sans any medical conditions that render your organs unusable, what on earth is the point of burying or burning perfectly good human parts? It’s absurd to let other’s die for some silly idea that you need to keep someone whole. This seems like some ancient practice that has infiltrated modern society. This should get roughly the same attention that abortion does but for some reason it does not.

Anyone against organ donation, change my view. Religion won’t help.

It literally does not matter. How can we as a society move up the intelligence ladder when we still think like this? IT IS A BUNCH OF CELLS PERFORMING A JOB THAT WILL CEASE TO EXIST ONCE THE HUMAN IS DEAD. What are y’all talking about you freaks.

Passive income and earned income should be treated exactly the same with regards to income tax,"If you make $100,000 from W2 employment or make $100,000 from investment income (capital gains, dividends, whatever) then you should have the same tax liability. I believe that this sort of indiscriminately taxing income without concern for the source is the only way that income tax should be collected. Not interested in debating what the tax rate should be or whether or not income taxes are theft, just this aspect of income taxes that having different rates for different types of income is asinine and unnecessarily complicated. Deductions, in America's tax structure, is only used by less than 20% tax payers anyway, so getting rid of all deductions and just have the standard deduction for everybody if any deduction (not beholden to that specific detail). Sorry in advance if your particular bugaboo tax issue is **NOT** this but it won't change my view if you try to hijack my CMV to be about what you want it to be. 
 
The metric I would judge arguments for income  discrimination would John Rawls' [Veil of Ignorance ](https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/veil-of-ignorance) which is to say that a bias to preserve advantages for those who already have them is not persuasive. Is there some reason why it benefits everyone to have a different tax rate for different types of income? An argument in favor of a flat tax rate that is indiscriminate taxing all income is not distinct from my view, but the flat tax rates that have been proposed by presidential candidates like Steve Forbes, Herman Cain and Rick Perry all discriminate on basis of class of income giving a different rate for investment income (usually lower than both the current rate or lower  than wage tax rate), which is not the same thing as indiscriminately taxing all forms of income at the same rate.

Sex work should be discouraged.,"When I met my girlfriend she was really close to doing it. She had deep issues with self esteem, she was approaching her mid 20's with no discernible direction in her life, she was getting frustrated with her job and she had a close friend who was already doing it and making good money. This is a perfect storm for a girl to get into sex work. But I think it would have been a decision which irreparably damaged her if that was the path she chose.

I don't hold anything against sex workers. I don't think they have less inherent worth as a human being.

But I do think that you should discourage anyone you know and care about from being involved in it, and I don't think there are many if any good reasons to do it.

I believe (from my limited experience) that the majority of those who get into sex work have issues with mental health and especially self worth. I believe that a majority of those who do it are vulnerable people who become even more vulnerable through sex work. I believe that when you put a price on yourself like that and let yourself be treated like an object it would be extremely hard for it to not have a negative impact on your self esteem.

Mostly I believe that there are so many things that a human being can be and achieve in our society and that it's a deadend job which obviously doesn't offer much upward mobility. It's a quick way to make good money, and I think most girls who do it probably regret it, and the ones who don't would if they weren't so fucked up by the experience.

Gun legislation is not what Americans should be focused on when trying to solve the issue of gun violence,"Everyone is looking for a solution, but my opinion is that the majority of folks aren’t looking in the right place.

The Democratic presidential candidates’ responses to this shooting are all themed around ‘more gun laws’ and the constantly debated policies like universal background checks. I think we definitely need the common-sense gun laws, but we all can say for sure that even if they were implemented to perfection *these issues will still persist since access to illegal guns is far greater than legal avenues for obtaining guns*. California still suffers from shootings, despite their incredibly strict gun laws.

I think that we are paying too much attention to external solutions involving laws, the government, and what we perceive as a straightforward response with the goal of aiming right at the heart of the gun problem. Legislation with the word gun written all over it. I will admit that the political climate is a causal factor in so many of these shootings, especially this one. Changing that specifically, however, will come down to eliminating the rightwing bigotry and hatred stemming from Trump and many other political figures. That’s the hard part and will only be fixed once we take down the enablers of this violence, which will only be possible through the elongated political processes that are necessary to removing these figures.

That’s not something I want to focus on right now. I want to focus on what is going on inside these shooter's heads that is so different from a normal person's it causes them to commit these atrocities. These people are essentially doing one thing: they are trading their own life to destroy the lives of others. They all go in knowing that the outcome will either end in their death or imprisonment for the rest of their life. They accept that their life will be ruined. What this means is that they lack the things that make life enjoyable and worth living it. There are circumstances in their lives that make it so that they do not care about whether they live or die.

This is simply depression. A problem that is certainly not limited only to individuals who commit these heinous crimes. There is a great deal of people who lack wills to live. Gun criminals included. In essence, they live life in misery. For some, this leads to suicide. But, if you are able to help a person who is plagued with depression find a compelling reason for them to love their lives, they’ll regain the motivation to participate in society in the way that we as a collective think every person should.

Unfortunately, more people in society are affected by this than the populace would like to accept and pay attention to. Fortunately, the vast majority of these people do not commit crimes against others. These issues are created by the society we built. Being affected by these issues brings people who are depressed to one destination: feeling alienated.

All my life I grew up poor and being entirely self-sufficient as a 19-year-old with no family support, I feel alienated in so many different ways. So very often, I find myself very depressed and lacking a will to live. It makes me unable to do things with others that make our days enjoyable. It makes it harder to socialize. Being poor makes it harder to participate in society, alongside so many other things. Having a country with millions of people affected by a plethora of woes caused by society leads to a culture of depression. Systemic change can start here, and I truly think that solving apparent issues with the economy, healthcare systems, and bad conditions in the workplace can benefit our nation’s problem of depression. This is just one example.

What I think it all comes down to is providing solutions to people’s feelings of depression and alienation. Those two things are why people stop caring about their own lives. When people care about their own lives they also care about other people’s lives and will act to preserve the sanctity of both. This means we should reinvigorate mental health institutions with as much effort we can possibly put into it.

I work for my university’s school of social work. I’ve met so many social workers who all agree that everyone, no matter how mentally stable one may seem, should see counsellors. Social workers have had so much impact on American society. Yet, they receive very little praise and attention from all of us.

This is where I think we should start. By making every person feel like their life is worth living. If we can figure out how to do all of this in the right way, I think it’s our best shot at ending gun violence and so many other detriments to the lives of everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I think I should add more nuance to why we can't do both. I think that gun legislation detracts to this problem of mental illness.

1. 400 million guns are currently in circulation. There is no way any gun legislation can change this fact. New guns, perhaps. However, the fact that we already have so many guns just shows that laws will do nothing unless we change what's going on with the person behind the trigger.
2. It is easier to obtain a gun illegally than it is to obtain one legally. This just shows that any law will be ineffective. Not only are there straw purchasers that profit off of selling guns to people who shouldn't have them, these people who shouldn't have them already have the guns. There's 400 million of them to go around.
3. Doing both would waste resources on the 'solution' that won't work. At all. It is my view that all resources should be directed to solving the problems with mental health that I labelled above.

Also, why am I getting my karma ruined for merely participating in this sub? I'm just trying to have a thoughtful discussion.",cm1pca,"I'm a Clinical Psychologist. Right now in the vast majority of the country I have absolutely no recourse for realistically removing a gun from the hands of a troubled patient. There is no universal registry. If I identify someone at risk, my only realistic recourse (with some exceptions in some states) is to forcefully lock them up against their will. That is temporary and it still wouldn't necessarily remove a gun. It also wouldn't prevent that person from obtaining a gun (again with some exceptions in some states). Finally, even if I am in a position to have the police remove a gun, which is possible if I'm certain the person is a danger to themselves or others, I have no way to know for sure if the person owns a gun. Again, because said registry doesn't exist to be searched by people who need that information, like providers.

"""My Body My Choice"" as a slogan doesn't do anything to change the minds of Anti Abortionists","I'll elaborate because this subject is a firestorm. I'm liberal, pro choice. I believe there are too many situations where forcing a pregnancy is just rife with issues and no one benefits. The right and wrongs of abortion are for another discussion, not this one.

However, the phrase, ""My Body My Choice"" never sat well with me as a way of convincing an opposing side whose concern is for another being; it sounds flippant.  To those who oppose abortions, it's akin to hearing someone say ""it's between me and my child if I want to murder them"". It sounds like they're aware it's murder, been backed into a corner and are choosing to say, ""well I can murder if I want to"". It must sound like insanity to anti abortion crowds and only reinforce the idea that pro choice is all about baby killing. I feel like the left (or pro choice supporters) needs to find a better way to convey the idea.

&amp;#x200B;",vcbl0r,"I think that you are correct with the slogan ""My Body My Choice"", HOWEVER. However. I disagree that it's ineffective because the opposing side is concerned for the life of the baby.

Think about some of the things that conservatives are more likely to value. Guns, traditional marriage, freedom...

Now which of those can you fit into the slogan and have it carry the same meaning? ""My Body My Gun""? No. ""My Body My Man""? Almost, but not quite. ""My Body My Freedom""? Yes.

If leftists change the slogan to ""My Body My Freedom"" immediately it starts resonating with people on the right. There are many conservatives out there who aren't radical Christians and are only anti-abortion by default; not because they're married to that position. There are many who just want to be allowed to do what they want and to be left the fuck alone. ""My Body My Freedom"" immediately resonates with these people, and it should draw their attention and make them more willing to hear your point of view.

**TLDR: Change slogan to ""My Body My Freedom"" and it does help change the minds of some anti-abortionists.**",ich2fho
Travel is a vastly overrated pastime.,"Just took a 1 week vacation to California and honestly the hassle of spending 5 hours in a super uncomfortable chair I'm not allowed to get out of, wasting time in airports, and the lack of sleep from the time change and unfamiliar lodging completely mitigated any enjoyment I might have gotten out of it.

"For websites with no financial or otherwise sensitive information at risk, I should be able to have a stupid, easy to guess password if I choose to.","I don't understand why so many websites and apps require complex passwords with special characters, capitalization, etc. if there is no money or sensitive personal information at stake.

I am a regular porn user,"So, I know reddit has strong opinions in favor and against watching porn, although I haven't really looked into the issue. The thing is, I watch porn almost daily, and haven't questioned the ""goodness/wrongness"" of it before, mainly because every male friend I have does it too, without any shame. But recently I have started to think maybe it's not a good decision. So I have decided to see if you can give me some good reasons to stop doing it. Until now, the most frequent I have found are:

1. Watching porn is unhealthy. But at the same time, there are a lot of people who think it's actually pretty good for your health. Most reasoning in this line of thinking seem to me, at the moment, pretty bad. After all, almost everyone sees porn and we don't find any apparent disadvantage to it. Also, some say it changes your conception  on women and diminishes your libido, but again a lot of people says it actually doesn't.
2. Porn is inmoral, because it capitalizes on the explotaition of women (i suppose this argument would include men too, although they are not mentioned so often). This is my biggest concern. On the one hand, one could think that women choose freely to enter the industry so it's actually their choice, and if they can make profit, good for them. On the other hand, is possible that some of them are forced into it (but i don't know the how big of a percentage that would be). Also, some say that most people have to do porn because they have no other way to make money, and that's a kind of explotaition. But I don't see much difference between that and the everyday life of a lot of people working jobs they don't like (and please, take this in the kindest way possible, I don't mean to downplay anyone's suffering, I just say that, in different jobs, we seem to accept it as a normal part of life: you have to work to make money, even if you don't like it). Another argument i've heard is that that kind of job causes psychological trauma to a lot of actresses, but again, I don't know if that is true for a great part of the workers or not. 
3. Porn is inmoral because it's not neccessary in order to live a good life, and it quits you time to do something more important. I kind ir understand this, but it sounds a little crazy to me. Like, when you come home tired after work, or whatever, and you want to have some time and enjoy yourself, I don't see anything wrong with that. Sure, if you are doing it five times a day and you spend hours on it, you either have a problem or are a horny fifteen year old, but otherwise, I don't see the problem.

So that's it. What's your opinion Reddit?",gb75cx,"After a lifetime of porn consumption, I was lucky I found a partner who was patient with my lack of performance. It took a while, but I finally achieved the confidence to give her what she needs 🍆",fp437ma
Boomers are the worst generation and until we stop catering to them with our government policies our society will not get better,"Almost everything wrong with our current society can be blamed on boomers, the housing prices, low wages, horrible job market, offshoring to China, global warming, allowing companies to violate privacy rights and roll back our other rights everything was done on the boomers watch and most of it was for their benefit and future generations detriment. 

I'm struggling to think of a major flaw in our society that can't be traced back to boomers, all these policies were done specifically for their benefit at the cost of future generations. If you look at trends on how people are doing globally things are getting better but in western countries like Canada, US, Australia ect. it's all getting worse, I believe suicides especially of young people is the greatest indicator of that.

It is not wrong for a woman to reject a man based on his height,"Recently I got mass down voted on an r/tinder thread for defending women who preferred taller men. I'd like to hear from some reasonable people about whether or not I'm in the wrong here.

In the thread, the general sentiment was that:

-short women having some arbitrary height requirement (e.g 6' and up only) should not be socially acceptable, and that it makes more sense for women to go for any guy taller than them regardless of by how much if height is something they care about. 

-they mock the idea of very short women wanting to get with very tall men, saying that there's no reason they should do that. 

-because height is not something you can change, it should not be a factor in choosing who you are attracted to. They feel it is completely different from rejecting someone based on weight because if you are overweight you can lose the weight if you really want. 

-they talked A LOT about something called 'heightism' in dating spheres as though there was some sort of prejudice against them as opposed to women generally preferring taller men (which I do not think can seriously be compared to any other - ism I can think of) 

My stance is this:

-Wanting someone a specific height is perhaps a little shallow, but especially in the dating app sphere (where its not like you can tell someones personality from a picture or a few messages, and attractive women have their pick of hundreds of guys) it is fair enough to filter for any factor you find desirable.

-Even outside of dating apps, wanting someone taller is a preference you are allowed to have. It's no different from guys often preferring girls with bigger boobs or wider hips for example. (in the thread I mentioned, guys seemed to believe there was an evolutionary reason to want those things yet no evolutionary reason to want a taller man).

-Guys will reject women based on features they can't change all the time. Height is just one of those that mainly affects guys.

-heightism is pretty much not a real thing. 

I do believe that generally short guys might have a harder time dating, but I don't think it's impossible to find someone who doesn't care about height so much. If they are going to use tinder then they accept that they are joining a platform 10/1 men to women, so women have their pick even if they do so arbitrarily. 


To be honest, I believe this is pretty cut and dry. I'm not sure what would change my view, but if you can present some case that shows women are somehow in the wrong for choosing who they want to date I'll be interested.

Edit: when I said heightism is not a real thing, I meant in the dating context it is not strictly an unfair prejudice so much as a reasonable preference.

Men carry more responsibility when it comes to sex,From what I’ve seen people generally blame the man if the sex was bad. “He’s smaller than what I’m used to or he’s too big.” “he didn’t last long” if he can’t orgasm people assume he has death grip. Guys rarely complain about a woman’s vagina and even if they do it’s usually turned back against them. For example if a guy says it’s too loose ppl will just say he’s probably too small to feel it totally ignoring that vaginas do come in different sizes too and just blaming the man in this situation again. If sex isn’t something a man does to a woman and something that two partners do together why do men get a lot of blame for bad sex.,vsvi4y,"When it comes to sexual performance, I would’ve said absolutely yes in my 20s. Now I realize how much women blame themselves when we have “difficulties” so it’s more like a moderate yes.

With respect to undesired consequences of sex, both pregnancy and STDs (which are typically more easily passed from men to women than otherwise) no it’s more on women, which is only magnified now for obvious reasons.",if8e2gu
when you move to a new country you should want to assimilate,"People often claim it’s racist to suggest that people who move to a country should integrate  with the culture they’ve moved to. I think that it’s perfectly reasonable to expect that they do. This isn’t to suggest that they cannot hold on to their previous identities, or speak their mother tongue language to people who also speak it, or practice their religious values, but they should want to adopt some of the culture exists in their new country. 

They chose to move to a new country, and it shouldn’t be surprising that people find some things like the fact that they won’t learn the language, or they talk down on the culture, a bit annoying. This in no way means that they should be harassed or mistreated for it though. 

I just don’t understand why it’s something people view as racis/xenophobic. 

Edit: when I say integrate, I don’t mean giving up things like their native food or likes and dislikes, but rather learning to speak the language of their area, or trying to respect the cultural values of their surrounding area. The goal should be that you want to combine your cultures.",eq5jkp,Well... theres a problem with that lol. what about the countries that were forced into another countries rule and had to adopted that country’s way of life? then technically your assimilating to the rule of those who took over,feohg48
Black protestors are being harmed by all the left leaning white kids who think its ok to riot.,"Police brutality is a serious issue. People are right to be incensed by the death of George Floyd, and this protest movement is entirely justified. 

That said, rioting is not justified. As we've all seen, there are people looting, breaking windows, setting fires, and engaging in violence. These people are harming the image of the protest movement. They make it easy for others to delegitimize the movement by depicting the protestors as a bunch of thugs. 

What's infuriating is that a lot of these rioters are white kids. We all know who these people are. They wear black, they're left leaning, and they're quick call people Nazi's. They often identify as antifa. Though some of them may simply view themselves as anti-authoritarian punks. A lot of them see non-violent protest as ineffective, and they've convinced themselves that violence is justified. 

That's not to say that all black people are saints. There have certainly been some black looters. But, these white kids have played a prominent role in the riots, engaging in vandalism, starting violent confrontations, and generally escalating the situation. 

I guess they somehow think they're helping. But really, they're hurting black people. When you break windows and spray paint ""Black Lives Matter"", you give people the impression that these acts are being committed for black people. You make black people seem violent. You give ammo to all the racists who want to depict them as a bunch of animals. 

These assholes are having fun at the expense of black people. They're fucking up neighborhoods and essentially framing the black community. 

I'll end the post with a few videos to illustrate my point:

"To be considered a pie, it must be fully encased in pastry.","My view is quite simple, something must be encased in pastry to be considered a pie. There are other existing terms to describe other possible combinations such as pastry bases and potato tops or the like, so calling something a pie to describe the main part of the dish being encased (or partially encased) in something else is misleading.

Just because something is made with pastry doesn’t make it a pie- tarts, pasties and palmiers etc… are all made with pastry but don’t proclaim themselves to be pies, yet some things, such as cream pies are made with cake and bear no other resemblance to traditional pies, pumpkin pies are actually tarts and pie charts aren’t even edible and don’t have a filling- they are just disgraces to the name ‘pie’

I wish we all used a base-8 number system.,"If I were one of those Bronze Age scribes working out numerical notation, I would have favored a base-8 number system, not base-10.

Mainly because it makes division into units easy. Think about it: If I want to divide a board into 8 equal segments, I just divide the length by two, three times (1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8). I don't need any measuring stick to do this, necessarily. Just take some cordage or cloth and fold it in half to measure half distances, roughly speaking.

If I wanted to divide into 10 even pieces . . . well then I need my ruler. Sure I could divide into two halves, each being five units; but good luck from there trying to eyeball even fifths (Not to insult any carpenters here).

(Base-6 or base-9 would even be easier than base-10, because thirds can be eyeballed reasonably well. You can also create thirds with rope or cloth or paper, though it's not as simple.)

Also, it would be just that much easier to teach a young child eight symbols instead of ten.

So tell me why I'm wrong. What are the advantages to using base-10, besides using all your fingers and thumbs to count on?

(Actually you can use your hands to count to 16, using your fingers as ones and using your thumbs to mean four.)

Edit: I am NOT saying we should switch to base-8. I'm just commenting on what I think was a missed opportunity, that's all.",ix6epe,It seems kinda difficult on a practical basis but it ultimately led to the abstract nature of mathematics with all the rational and irrational numbers.

Canadian Geese are a weaponized wildlife.,"Most everyone hates Canadian geese. They gang up and chase pets and people, they have no fear of blocking roads, and they shit EVERYWHERE. No other animal of similar size is so fearless or so agressive, so they must have been bred that way or trained.

I believe the reason the Canadian people are seen as so ""nice"" is because as a nation, they have found a way to channel their hatred of America into the geese via the food they feed them, or possibly little goose sized mind control helmets. 

In conclusion we have been under attack by Canada for decades, and we are losing this war unless we send a weaponized animal attack of our own. I propose suicidal whitetail deer.",l2r7kb,"What are you talking about? 

I love Canada Geese, and I had no clue others apparently didn't. They're beautiful birds, large (which makes them stand out from the crows, pidgeons, ducks, and seagulls they hang out with), and I always laugh when I see a small child chasing them.

Also, since when are they violent? I used to go to a lake in my state when I was a kid, and my sister and I would run after flocks of Canada Geese - more than 100 in a group at times - and never once did they turn and try to chase or otherwise engage with us. We fed them french fries and bread. I don't think they allow that anymore in the parks, but in the 90s they did.",gkhqs37
Disney is monopolizing entertainment and needs to be checked before they start controlling culture,"Disney owns ESPN, 20th Century Fox, Hulu, Marvel, Star Wars, Comcast, History Channel, abc..the list goes on. [Here’s a link for anyone interested. ](https://storage.googleapis.com/titlemax-media/1c8ace8f-every-company-disney-owns-13_pageversion-lg.jpg)
This tells me they have dipped their toes into every form of entertainments that can be consumed by the population of earth. Controlling media and entertainment is how you control a culture or the way it thinks and acts. Disney is not doing anything too drastic with their agenda yet, but mark my words, there will come a time when all of the media you can find online or entertainment will be censored by Disney to fit their idea of what it should be. 

Let me break this down further. Disney has the authority to fire someone from one of their networks, especially a public one like ESPN, if they don’t agree with their views or agenda. Then, since they have money, they could make him disappear. Be it death by “suicide” or a lump sum to shut him up. So if a talk host on ESPN said something controversial but valid, Disney has the ability to control him and what the viewers hear. It’s censorship in the worst way. 

Disney owns too much and has the power to do too much. Let me make another example. Star Wars. I know, I know, “TLJ sucked, not canon! Duurrrrr!” I’m not here to bash the movies. I’m here to bash the EU. Disney is controlling what type of Star Wars is released to the public. Before Disney, there was a plethora of risqué Star Wars media. Video games, comics, books, etc. But now? It seems most Star Wars product are sterile, safe and innocent in an effort to maintain an identity for appealing to the whole family. Eff that! Star Wars was never restricted to one form of media and while the films were tamed, the rest could have done whatever it wanted! Here’s another one, Star Wars: Battlefront II the video game was under scrutiny for its loot box fiasco (gambling in games that kids can access). I have NEVER seen a game turn around as fast in my life and as delicately. My guess, Disney cracked the whip on EA and their 10 year game deal and EA panicked because money talks. If Disney has the power to do that to EA, they will have no trouble forcing an agenda into other networks that they own. 

Am I missing something? Does Disney not have the freedom I think they do with the networks they own? To me, it seems they’re orchestrating some type of cultural shift by acquiring networks and studios in all forms of entertainment in order to push their own ideas and agendas.

Edit: After reading through some of your comments, I think it’s necessary to clarify a few things.

1) I’m not an economist and my knowledge of this topic has been broadened immensely from just hearing what some of you had to say, so thank you for enlightening a dull individual such as myself. It has changed my view in some areas of this discussion. 

2) Comcast is NOT owned by Disney, I misread that detail when doing a quick research. I’m sorry for mixing that up. 

3) My terminology is not entirely accurate since I’m not as privy to the business side. But the spirit of the post is still intact and is directed at Disney having the control and influence over media and the ability to possibly censor or influence future generations.",gedlqu,"Don't worry, a correction is occurring now.

Attempted murder should not be a crime. Any attempt at murder should be tried as murder and the jury should not know whether the murder was successful.,"A person's prison sentence should depend solely on the danger they pose to society. An attempted murderer and a murderer are both equally dangerous. Each attacked a person with the intent to kill them, the only difference being that one succeeded.

The fact a victim happened to survive shouldn't affect the punishment. They should be punished for their actions, not their results. Intentions are a much better indicator of the future danger they pose to society than the results.

Intent is also the only difference between manslaughter and murder or between negligence and assault. In this case there's no difference between the intents, only the results.

People should be punished for negligence and intents, but not for results. I'd rather people be punished for bad actions with good results than good actions with bad results. It's the reason we arrest drunk drivers who didn't hit anyone, but not people who crashed  as a result of a freak car problem.

EDIT: I realize it probably wouldn't actually be practical to hide the outcome from the jury, but I still think the charge should be murder whether the victim dies or not.",gf34b8,If the murder wasn’t a murder how can you prove that there was ever an intention to murder?,fprrlv8
tealth and combat drones negate the use of fighters and most manned aircraft,"Stealth drones are to manned aircraft as the Maxim gun was to the charge 

For the uninitiated I mean that one significantly armed stealth drone may have the capability to negate the power projection of any manned aircraft in a battlefield. This is due to thier ability to: 

1. Conduct offensive and intelligence missions similar to manned aircraft without human risk 
2. With the support of modern SAM systems they can create a ""net"" that can target enemy aircraft. Thus maintaining air superiority with out direct ""dog fights"" ( which are not as common in modern warfare) 
3. While debatable, operational time in manned aircraft is dependent on the training of the pilot. While drones can reach maximum operational time consistently. Most notably change pilots mid mission 
4. The cost of building, training and deployment over time will and is decreasing  rapidly. A nation may be able to field a higher number of drones faster than manned aircraft 

It is my opinion that the days of the fighter pilot are coming to an end. Soon most if not all offensive and intelligence gatheting aircraft will be drones. Supported by SAM systems

As most modern missiles are already faster than fighter jets. So speed isn't a issue anymore. It's about rate of sorties and  to an extent disposablility. You can have 2000 manned aircraft but a good SAM system backed by MAN-PAD and drone intelligence rendereds it useless

Your plane goes down that is both the hardware and pilot. A drone goes down you just switch command to a new one",tgzjt7,"Interference. While interference can be an issue for manned aircraft having it remotely controlled drastically increases the different ways interference can occur.

If a fighter pilot loses communication with command, they can still make decisions and follow protocols to carry out a mission or safely return. If a drone loses communication it will most commonly undergo an automated program to return to a designated location. 

I am somewhat unwilling to believe you can ""hack"" a drone, the amount of technological effort that would go into hacking a modern military drone would be extreme, but I do believe interrupting the signal is very possible which would negate their reliability.

Also, without men in the craft, there are very challenging obstacles to overcome like rescue missions. Not all pilot missions are dog-fights.",i156qqg
"the ""we can revolt against a dangerous government"" is a really bad argument for ownership of guns.","Don't get me wrong, I'm not pro gun control but I'm in support of responsible, regulated ownership, especially in the context of self-defense against a violent crime (home invasion, mugging etc.), but I personally believe that the above argument is essentially invalid, especially in the US. The argument is that when worst comes to worst, when democracy has failed, when the government is slaughtering citizens left and right and no-one's stepping in to help, the public's ownership of firearms will somehow be enough to violently overthrow the government. Why I think this:

* The US government is one the most, if not *the* most, heavily armed forces in the world. I highly doubt that several citizens with AR-15s will be able to compete with jets, bombs, armed trucks, nuclear warheads, Apaches and massive ships and aircraft carriers.


* Most of these people will likely never be able to actually stand up to the government in such a situation. The only way a government could ever do this is either like China (mass censorship, isolation from the outside world and mass extermination) or where the populous is so dumbed down and used to the extreme action the government takes that it has full freedom to do whatever it wants without complaint. In the latter (which is most likely), the citizens will probably willingly hand over their guns anyway, and even if not, they would never go against their own country, their motherland (or whatever it will be then).

I find Sex and Sexual Activities (Including Pornography) Repulsive and Degrading,"(Disclaimer I was not raised in a religious household.) 

For as long as I have known about sex, I have felt conflicted about it. Now however I think of it as a shameful activity that should only be used for reproduction. (I know this is an antiquated view, but I am having troubling viewing it any differently.) Sex appears to me as this entity that in a way controls and destroys so many people’s lives. I understand people can have consensual and loving sex, but I still can’t help myself but to be repulsed by promiscuous people (Though I don’t shame them) . I am almost strictly against sex because it leads to spread of incurable diseases (ala Herpes and Super Gonorrhea) and the degradation of relationships. I just simply despise the fact that sex is such an essential in people’s lives. Especially to the point where people end entire relationships because of sexual incompatibility. It feels like so many people are so obsessed with sex. People manipulate and lie to others to get sex. There are so many people who are constantly horny and they do extreme things to “get-off”. Speaking of such... I absolutely abhor pornography. It’s extremely exploitative (even the amateur porn) and it causes people to have addictions. It bothers me quite a lot that people are so addicted that they ruin their relationships (I fear one day that may happen to a significant other)... also the fact there is so much violent porn out there (I.e rape and suffocation porn). It’s very disgusting ... especially when people dismiss it as “just a fantasy”. 

Anyways. I say all that to say I would like to see another perspective. I wish not to be so disgusted with sex. I know it’s not an entirely healthy attitude to have.


Edit: Stupid Typo",f304h6,"You may look into -

(i) Asexuality - A sexual orientation, if you don't enjoy sex as much as mainstream folks.

(ii) Celibacy - If you enjoy sex but fear addiction and abuse, and hence, choose to abstain from it.

Confidence does not comes from within. It comes from external validation and success.,"First; just logically it makes no sense that confidence is a choice. If it was as easy saying, “Ok I’m going to be confident” there would be no self doubt, self esteem issues, or insecurities.

Looking more at this, confidence is a result of factors such as self esteem. Self esteem is internal but often it is shaped by outside experiences. A person who has for the last 15 years of his life been told he’s ugly is not going to have a good view of himself. Even if he’s able to accept being ugly, it’s still highly likely that he won’t have that self esteem.

Now let’s say someone is physically attractive from childhood. This person gets attention from the preferred sex even as a child and this continues into high school and college. Do you think this person’s confidence in say dating would be a result his inner thoughts or the validation he received all his life.

Another example would be a job. A person who has worked on their craft for years and had multiple accolades is going to be confident. But what about a person who’s work constantly has errors And they are constantly reprimanded. Not as confident.

When you’re given praise or attention for something you will feel more confident in it. Confidence come from outside in, not inside out.",uyxr1h,"Confidence is this weird kinda thing, because it's a feeling but at the same time it's a behaviour.

I'm not confident at all. I've never felt an ounce of a good feeling about my social performance. But I'm also very confident. I talk to everyone like we've been friends for decades, I routinely get boons and favours from people by just being very determined, forward and friendly.

So basically, while the first kind of confidence truly is a result of your successes (and some biochemistry etc), the second one is pretty much a decision.

Oh, on the topic of biochemistry. Doesn't the fact that some people are instantly confident on alcohol/benzos contradict your claim? Doesn't it mean that you can have more or less confidence based on what's your chemistry balance/thought patterns, regardless of your history?

You shouldn't let your little son go to kindergarten / elementary school in a dress,"**Last Edit:** Thanks for the posts, discussions and experiences. Unfortunately midnight is coming fast and poor me has to get up in the morning.

Based on a discussion inside an AITA post.

I think it would be great if we could live in a world where everyone could walk around in whatever kind of clothes they like. Boys should be able to wear dresses if they like and it shouldn't have any negative consequences for them. Don't ask me for a specific age when it would be ok for them to decide something like that. Maybe in their teen years.

But I don't think we are living in a world like that and I think as a parent you shouldn't let your son go to kindergarten / elementary school (edit: at least age 5 to 9) as long as he is not able to understand the possible consequences of such a behavior. Worst case he'll be bullied for a long time, just because he couldn't understand the consequences of his actions and had no parents who protected him from himself.

If it's important for the parents to change the world to place where wearing a dress as a boy is normal, then they should try to raise their son be accept it to be different and they should act as a role model and accept such a behavior and maybe the father should even wear a dress to work if he desires.

Would it be the fault of the boy if he would get bullied for such an action? No, that would be victim blaming, but being right doesn't help a lot, if you're still the victim.

edit: The dress example is probably just one of many things where you should interfere as a parent to protect your child from consequences the child couldn't yet understand. I just picked it as an easy example.

edit 2: Personal experiences are fine, but you probably won't change my view with it, as it simply will be experience vs. experience. Child development studies or something alike that shows me that this kind of protection is too much or that children are in fact earlier than expected able to imagine long term consequences.",laaiyq,"I was bullied as an elementary school kid, now I wasn’t a boy wearing a dress but I was a quote quirky kid and I had a mild stutter when I was nervous. I’m so glad that my parents never tried to get me to just be less weird or quirky at school to be bullied less. I learned young to find people and friends that appreciated who I was and I built the confidence to be exactly who I am. 

A close family friend had parents who helped her fit in better at school and she was bullied in school less but she’s honestly a much less happy adult. She’s now trying to figure out how to be confident in herself and ignore the “bullies” in adult life. 

I think it’s good to warn your son in this case that other kids might tease him for wearing a dress because they think dresses are for girls but preventing it all together is a bad idea.",glmxvsu
"If you deliberately falsely accuse someone of a crime, you should recieve rhe punishment that the accused would have recieved, if they had been found guilty, plus the scentence for perjury.","Lets say, for sake of argument, person X accuses person Y of crime A. X knows that Y did not commit this crime, but X does not like Y. X mmakes a seemingly valid case, with made up stories, and fake evidence. 

Lets say crime A has an average scentence of 10 years. The jury is about to convict Y, when new evidence is found, that shows that X made up these claims.

Y is immediately acquitted, and X is charged with perjury. The formula for X's scentence is as follows:

the scentence Y would have recieved if found guilty of crime A + an appropriate scentence for perjury + financial compensation for the damages associated with being falsely accused of a crime.

Reasons for this:
- discourages the use of false accusations as a form of revenge
- increases the integrity of court hearings, as no one in their right mind would lie to court.
- saves the government money, as they have less court cases over false accusations.

- demonstrating that this is in some way unfair

Defamation, slander, and libel are crimes, already.

Let's take your standard to logical conclusions. No sane person can remotely claim that being falsely accused of murder has the same negative ramifications as actually being murdered. Putting someone in prison for life on that basis makes no rational sense. 

By all means punish them for wasting the time of the justice system. She them for defamation. But they didn't take anyone's life. It's unreal to pretend otherwise. 

Of course the one everyone, including you, are thinking about here is rape. It's a laughable joke that people are so paranoid about false rape accusations. Actual rapists walk more than 9 in 10 times. The ones that so get sent to prison usually get such light sentences, and often conciliatory words from the judge. Even as recently as 2013 CNN spent 3 minutes stroking themselves about how the two students from Stubenville Ohio who gang raped a passed out under aged girl, filmed it, and shared it on their teams website had their promising futures ruined and how people had heartfelt sorrow for their loss.

Meanwhile actually being raped is seen by many as worse than being murdered. For many it is a lifetime of anxiety, stress, self hatred, paranoia, isolation. For many it leads to suicide. 

I guess if you want to send someone who falsely accused someone of rape to prison for a summer like many actual rapists get off with I'm fine with that, but to even pretend that it compares to the act of rape is irrational and illogical.

The USA would be better off split up into smaller countries.,"This is assuming that the split would be peaceful.

So I base the opinion off the fact that most of the world's happiest nations are much smaller than the US population-wise. In fact if you look at a list of the top ten most-populous nations (China, India, USA, Indonesia, Pakistan, Brazil, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Russia, and Mexico) I wouldn't want to live on any of these countries over the US. This means that creating a high standard of living for all your people is very difficult in a large country. In contrast, Sweden has the population of North Carolina, and Denmark is the population of Wisconsin.

While free trade and free movement of people is a serious argument for a federal union, there is a country that is much smaller than the US and is better off despite the lack of free trade and movement with it's larger neighbor.

 don’t want a pet ever again,"Hello everyone I’m on mobile I’m sorry if my formatting is bad. I’m also sorry if this is the wrong place to post but I’m hoping someone can convince me why I should get another dog in the future because for now I never want a dog ever again.
 I don’t want a dog ever again for 2 reasons. 
The first one is that I love dogs but losing them just hurts too much. 
The second reason is that I don’t think there will ever be a dog as good or as well behaved as mr.weenie. He just had such a calm nature. 

For those who want the background here it is: This is my first death in my life that has effected me. I still can’t believe he’s gone. Yesterday my dog Mr.weenie passed away. I had a few dogs growing up but Mr.weenie was the one I had for the longest and was overall a great doggo. I was able to teach him sit and lay on my own and while this may not be anything big to me it was so cool to see him learning and playing with me. 

I had him since he was a puppy in 2013 and he was the best dog ever. He never barked at visitors, bit anyone, or had jumped on someone when he got excited. Thanks to him my girlfriend was able to pet a dog for the first time ever. She was also terrified of dogs but Mr.weenie was so kind and well behaved to her she was able overcame her fear of dogs. She was also able to carry him and that was something she thought she could never do but he let her and he was so calm. I think he knew that if he got excited she would be scared so he stayed calm for her.

Civil forfeiture does not respect due process.,"CMV: In civil forfeiture law enforcement takes money or other assets suspected of being involved in criminal enerprise. The owner has to prove that this was not the case for them to get the asset in question back. This moves the burden of proof to the individual and, in my opinion, goes against the presumption of innosence. Furthermore one cannot prove negative, i.e. the absence of criminal behaviour. The burden of the proof in similar cases in other countries that I know of is on the law enforcement.

Bleu cheese is disgusting,"I've always avoided bleu cheese.  I've always suspected bleu cheese would taste bad based on the pungent smell and the fact that it's a ""[moldy](https://www.businessinsider.com/bleu-cheese-mold-2012-6)"" cheese.  

Today for the first time I ordered a salad with bleu cheese &amp; decided not to sub it out.   

I love cheese, and will admit that most cheese smells-- off. Like rotten milk.  Nevertheless I love a good gouda, cheddar, muenster, mozzarella, etc.

But bleu cheese is nasty! It tastes like [how old people smell](https://www.healthline.com/health/older-people-smell-different#treatment). 

It overpowered every flavor in the dish. The tartness of the apples, the bitterness of the greens, the umami chicken were all covered in a musty taste.  And twenty minutes after eating, it the taste lingers on.

Anarchism cannot survive in the long term.,"This post will mostly cover economically left wing and economically right wing anarchism, as those are what I'm most familiar with. However, the main points should hold true for any kind of anarchism.

Anarchy has historically only taken hold in times of extreme instability or where government authority is very hard or near impossible to enforce. This is because it intentionally forgoes one of humanity'a biggest advantages: the ability to coordinate on a large scale. This flaw dooms anarchism to be only a transition phase between states in conflict, or onl technically in place because a government hasn't yet been able to enforce its rule. Both cases are not exactly hopeful for any anarchist who believes anarchism is the only way to liberate humanity.

Anarcho Capitalists want to remove the state in order to let market forces guide the world. To prevent people's inherent liberties from being infringed, they want everyone to voluntarily follow the Non Aggression Principle, which claims that aggressive or non-consensual behavior except in self defence. The issue with the N.A.P. is that it is by definition non-enforcable, leaving nothing to stop coorprate interests from establishing a bannana republic, or any popular movement to create a new state that isn't afraid to use force to acheive its aims.

Anarcho Socialists, Anarcho Communists, or just Anrachists believe both the state and capitalism to be unjust hiearchies that must both be dismantled for true equality and freedom. In this case, invasion of the anarchic territory is even more likely than usual, since most nations follow a market economy and would see Anarcho Socialism gaining ground as a direct threat to their interests. This ends in either a coorprate bannana republic, foreign occupation, or simply a reinstatement of the former government.


I would like my view changed on this, because I'm curious to see how an anarchist society (actually established due to a belief in anarchism, and not the default anarchism decribed above or an isolated commune) would work in the real world. I'm far from an anarchist myself, but I can sympathize with their desire to live their lives in freedom unmolested by the state. If some aspects of anarchism could actually work, I'd like to see them tested so we might implement some ideas even into state-run societies.

Edit: Thank you for your submissions everybody. Unfortunately, I have some other stuff to get to, and have to call this off. Thanks for participating!",gidd5v,"I’ll give you my main points why I think An-Cap (Anarcho-Capitalism) can work that hopefully also answers some of your main concerns.

The main reason I think An-Cap can work is 

1). Small to City sized states still exist today Despite being within range of a state capable of invading. So if an entire city read Rothbard &amp; came to the conclusion that they should abolish their local gov. there’s no reason to assume nearby states would instantly invade if the An-Cap community posed no treat.

2). Anarchy just means there are no rulers. It doesn’t mean there can’t be leaders. I think the main difference here is that people have the option to choose their leader/who enforces their rights on their property (or to not have them at all and fend for themselves, but that would be rare).",fqebec1
"Skilled poker players (I.E. People who count cards, and know the game inside and out) should not be banned from casinos.","Read a recent TIL post about how there's only one casino in America that allows skilled players.

As suggested in the title, skilled players should be allowed to play at casinos. Strictly on the grounds that they are being disqualified because they got really good at something. 

It could be argued that if enough skilled players engaged in playing, they could hurt a casino, or run it into the ground. And I agree casinos exist for the enjoyment of people, and if a whole bunch of skilled players were allowed to play, they may cripple a casino. But if rules are put in place, skilled players (who have a legitimate love for the games) would also be allowed to go out and test their skills. 

Possible Solution: Perhaps once a player wins a certain amount (eg. $5, 000,000), they are given a special status, where when they come in the future, they can only win up to $20,000 (or whatever). This way people can still come and enjoy the games, they just are not allowed to affect the casinos economic operations. 

To be clear, the exact dollar amounts in my solution are examples. The casinos themselves would be responsible for testing/setting their limits... But perhaps you can get the gist of what I'm suggesting. 

Casinos track your every movement with the cards they give you, and strategically come and do things like offer you alcohol after a certain amount of time you've been at the slots, or offer certain specials, etc. And your profile builds as you repeat your visits and they use algorithms to track you and maximize their potential for getting money out of you. So why not also integrate dollar limits into the skill player profiles?

Edit: Black Jack NOT poker",cmrvzw,I think you are confused. Casinos don't ban skilled poker players. Casinos make a rake on the action in poker games. They still get that same rake regardless of how much money players are taking from each other. How skilled a player is has almost no effect on how much the casino makes from poker games.,ew48lan
the English language would benefit from a tightly binding conjunction.,"So the premise is quite simple. I believe there should be a word with some connotation and notation implying a tighter binding than typical conjunctions.

E.g. salt and vinegar, when used as a single flavour is a tightly bound statement.

Now you might be asking how necessary this is, and I believe it isn't strictly necessary, but nor is the oxford comma. That doesnt mean it's not useful.

If we were to use the word 'tand' as an example (for a tight and), we could change the statement:

""The crisps I like are salt and vinegar and cheese and onion"" 

To the statement:

""The crisps I like are salt tand vinegar and cheese tand onion""

You can in essence think of it like putting brackets enclosing the salt and vinegar statement.

The main reason I think it's better is it makes language more precise for very little cost (particularly if it were something that flows from 'and' since it would be easier to adapt to).

That said, I have had a lot of half drunk debates about this, and never found anyone to be on my side (but since these were half drunk debates, points were not communicated well and I haven't been able to see the other side of the argument), so it would be good to see some arguments against.",unbvfc,"English's greatest strength is its flexibility, variety of word choices available, and ""pirates code"" view of formal rules.

Any society comprised of perfectly selfless individuals would inevitably become a utopia.,"This is a deep-rooted view I hold, and so I'm curious about the validity of my assumptions. Before I start explaining my viewpoint, let me define a few things.

My conception of a society is any group of people large or close enough to have set unique social standards and developed an internal culture. When I say, ""perfectly selfless individual,"" I mean someone who's primary drive is entirely focused on the welfare of others without any emphasis of the welfare of themselves, with the assumption that some amount of self-care (eating, bathing,  mental healthcare, etc.) is necessary to be the most beneficial to others. And by utopian, I'm trying to say that the, ""society"" (family unit, workplace, country, etc.) would with enough time achieve a state of existence which maximizes the collective good as much as possible (where the collective good is the total sum of each member's overall physical, mental, and emotional well-being).

I will break my argument into two parts, focusing first on why I believe such a society would be functional as a baseline and afterwards examining why I believe it would become utopian in the sense defined above.

First, suppose we have a population of N &gt; 1 perfectly selfless individuals which have formed a society. Take a representative member from this society; let's call him Jerry. Jerry is entirely focused on the welfare of others, and in any given situation he will always seek a win-win situation or else allow the other party to achieve the most positive outcome possible. In the real world,  a society with mixed or perfectly selfish individuals, Jerry would quickly be taken advantage of by members looking to maximize their own gain, and he would have to learn some amount of selfishness. However, in a society of only perfectly selfless individuals, Jerry doesn't need to worry about his best interests at all because there are N - 1 &gt;= 1 people who are concerned about him instead. In the case N = 2, then Jerry will care only about the other person and other person will care only about Jerry, so each member of the society has a full person's worth of attention given to their situation; and in the case N &gt; 2, then assuming each person cares equally about each other member of the society, the total attention Jerry or any individual gets from the N - 1 other people will still sum to a full person caring. In a society comprised of partially or perfectly selfish people that ""full person"" is normally the individual in question, but in my example of a completely selfless society, the population becomes the ""full person"" as a collective. In short, society becomes the self.

Now that I have established why I believe such a society would be functional, let me explain why I believe it would achieve utopian form with enough time, letting our metric for ""optimal"" be the collective good. Again, let's take the representative member Jerry as our example. Jerry is completely focused on how he can maximize his positive impact across society, and so regardless of whether he's mundane or important, a farmer or the president, Jerry's choice will always be the most universally beneficial he could possibly make with information he has since he's perfectly selfless. In this sense, Jerry will always maximize our optimization metric local to himself, and in the extension where every member of the society is also doing this, the optimization metric is globally maximized over time as each person individually makes locally optimal choices (insofar as we consider the society detached from the rest of thew world's actions). So in the sense that a utopia is a society which has achieved the most common good possible, Jerry's society will inevitably become utopian.

CMV!

Edit 1: A couple people have asked how they're supposed to change a view on an imaginary society comprised of people that don't exist. My response is that I've set up a system of assumptions about the individuals in question, and the metric that they're trying to optimize, so I want to know either A) how those assumptions break down when allowed to play out, or B) how the optimization metric I've defined (common good) does not logically lead to the kind of society I think it it does.

Edit 2: A couple people have asked about the point of this question, or pointed out that it's a pipe dream. The way the question is framed, I can see the point, but my main interest here isn't in some bullshit society that cannot and will not every exist; fundamentally, I'm trying to ask a question about whether selflessness as I've defined it is even logically consistent or ""good"" within the universe we live in, so I've created a frame of assumptions about perfect selflessness and an optimization metric (see edit 1) for ""utopian"" so that people can dispute this.

Edit 3: I should specify that my idea assumes that either the society exists in vaccum, or the actors within the selfless society only behave perfectly selflessly when dealing with other members of the selfless society (otherwise it'd be pretty easy to destroy from outside).",gixywt,"""Perfectly"" selfless would mean spending an inordinate amount of resources on helping the less fortunate rest of the world that would happily take advantage of you. Mass immigration has some very severe risks on that end. A perfectly selfless country gets invaded and conquered by one that is not.

Don't want to make it sound like I'm ragging on you, I do agree. But such an attitude can only come from within, not as a byproduct of heavy expectations or shaming. And there will be lots of shaming ***if*** people like you demand society be some kind of hyper-optimized machine, thus breeding resentment.",fqhi87e
Children should be taught psychology/basics of human behaviour right from a young age in school.,"I don't mean Psychology as a subject per se, but we should be taught how to understand our own behaviour from a very young age in schools itself. It should be taught and given as much importance as any other academics. 

Imagine how many stable adults we would have if they were taught all this from their childhoods. They would know how to navigate friendships, relationships, and would probably be significantly less fucked up than a lot of us are today.

And I don't mean having a school guidance counsellor or something. That doesn't always work for several reasons. What I am suggesting, aims at **normalising** all this for kids from a young age so that it doesn't become a taboo when they grow up.

Of course, this is subject to many external factors, too. Would love to hear your opinions.",nkjplt,"I mean, yeah. Secondary socialisation occurs during these formative years we spend in school. The topics we're taught most definitely indirectly or not shape the decisions we make and consequently who we consider ourselves to be and our place in society. I was exposed to sociology as a gcse and that was the start of seeing the world/society entirely differently for me. Opened my eyes if you will. Exposing young people to the complexities of the human experience within perhaps a sociological applied context would be a game changer. For eg concepts and realities around mental health, and how it can effect a myriad of things in ones life. 

Ppl have to quantify things, you know, make it into measurable things. That's why it would be hard to teach this type of ""abstract"" curriculum. They'd say ""how would we grade such a class?"".

"The advice given of ""cut people out of your life who are abusers"" actually makes the current situation of abuse far worse.","I would absolutely love to be proven wrong here. But let me make my case and explain some background first. A huge thing at the moment in the UK (I don't know if it's made it to world news status) is the recent and tragic death of a girl at the hands of a police officer. It's brought discussions as to how to deal with abusive people to the forefront of everyone's mind. And a very common bit of advice towards men for helping with it is to cut off connections to all abusive men. Now on the surface this makes sense. Don't support abusers. But here's the issue with it: A lot of abusers are the way they are BECAUSE of being ignored all their lives. They are lonely, gain a toxic mindset, and go on to do horrific things. Cutting them out just reinforces the only behaviour they know. Think of how toxic and horrible the incel community is, that's because of the way they are treated.

Now I need to say this to make absolutely sure people don't call me an abuser sympathiser. If you are an abuser in any form, you are scum. Gaining pleasure from making the lives of others worse makes you a parasitic little bitch and I truly hope hell is real, and is your destination past this life. But I don't think that cutting them off will fix anything. What we need to do is find ways to change their mindset and behaviour. Someone who is an abuser won't stop abusing because their friends have stopped hanging out with them, they'll just spend even more of their time abusing. What we need is to get these abusers into therapy. Push them into realising they need help, get them to talk about why they feel this way with a therapist, and maybe fix their broken ass viewpoints.

Obviously I'm not saying to be friends with abusive people. But in my opinion, if you have a friend who is showing the telltale signs of being an abuser, don't cut them out and ignore them. Encourage them to get help, push them to change. And if they don't... Idk, beat the shit out of them or something. But the only way we can stop abusers is by making them want to stop. And cutting off any other part of their life won't make them want to stop.

Anyways, as I said at the beginning, I'd love to be proven wrong here. I'd love to be able to just cut off anyone who acts like an abuser without feeling like I'm making the situation worse. So go ahead: CMV

Edit: I am in no way saying to anyone to stay with their abusers. If you are being abused, please get help and don't stay with them.

Organized crime is greatly exaggerated in media has almost no semblance to reality in the US.,"The Godfather. Breaking Bad. Better Call Saul. Scarface. The Sopranos. 

There are many great American movies and shows that depict corporate-like organized crime. It is my belief that this is not how it works, at least in the United States.


In the United States, if you get caught even selling a small portion of drugs, your life is over. In the movies, you see these heads of these criminal organizations, and they carry themselves like typical CEOs. They wear suits and they appear to be very intelligent and well-versed in business practices. 

But someone that intelligent knows about risk versus reward. Someone that intelligent has the capacity to get a legitimate job, making legitimate money. 

Yes, there are crime organizations in the US. Even ones that can be called organized. But in my opinion, the personnel in these organizations are not competent enough to do legitimate business. Therefore, people who participate in criminal businesses like drug trafficking/dealing, are typically not very intelligent. Because if they were, they would understand a simple concept of risk versus reward. And then they would quickly determine that it is absolutely not worth the risk to do that job.

Not to mention the war on drugs which I totally disagree with. But nonetheless, the USA, the richest country in the world, dedicates an insane amount of money to the war on drugs. Federal agents and law-enforcement have an abundance of resources, all dedicated to catching drug dealers. And there’s this misconception that the DEA does not care about small time dealers. That’s not true at all. If they get a tip that someone is selling drugs, even if it’s a small amount, they will absolutely execute a search warrant. Even if they find a small amount, they consider that a win. And they have nearly unlimited money to do so.

Anyone with average intelligence would know this and was not even consider getting into the illegal drug trade. Therefore, I believe that people who get into the illegal drug trade are either stupid or addicted to drugs themselves. This caricature of a suit and tie drug dealer like Gus Fring is a fantasy. And if you disagree with me, please find me a real life scenario where someone like Gus Fring actually existed.

Also, I find the, “you don’t know of any real life Gus Frings because they don’t get caught” argument to be weak and lazy. 

Change my view.",w3wfot,"So I’m not gonna tell you why, but I have a lot of credibility to speak on this.

I agree with you in some sense.  Movies absolutely paint organize crime in a way that’s really unrealistic. That being said, and I’m not insulting your intelligence at all by saying this, I think most people don’t really understand how organized crime actually works.

The reality is that organized crime functions a lot differently than what we see on TV. People rarely get taken out.  (edit: actually a lot of people get taken out but you wouldn’t know based off the circumstances. Most of the time it seems like some junkies shot people in a drug deal gone wrong, because that’s what they want it to look like) Of course we see that on TV because it makes for an interesting story. But a lot of these operations are running very covertly and are pretty smart about it.

Even in the criminal justice system, you got COs, cops, judges and DAs who are paid in cash if you know what I mean.

Now one thing that I will agree with you on is that the majority of crime happening in the US is stuff that people aren’t even really looking for. You know those public works lots with all of the sea salt they use during the winter?  Did you know that if you show up to those things with a vest on and a U-Haul nobody’s gonna call the cops on you? And did you know that you can fill the back of a U-Haul with about 20 buckets of salt which translates to a $200 profit for about an hour of work?

So yeah, not all crime that exists in the US is related to drugs and violence. But what I’m trying to understand here is by your logic, how do you think our country has such a big problem with drugs?  How do you think the drugs get into the country?

It is true that on paper it looks like being a criminal is a hard thing to do nowadays, but you got to understand that people are still responsible for things like cameras and prisons and all that jazz. And people can be bought.

Edit: I’m also gonna point out that people are a lot more likely to squeal than they are in movies and TV. It didn’t used to be this way but nowadays people turn on their brothers no problem. And the reality is with the opioid epidemic being as bad as it is, you can walk around basically untouchable in prison as a rat or a skinner because you got a Suboxone connect.

Granted, shifting to a national vote would change the game to a certain extent (e.g., a conservative Chicagoan would now have at least one reason to vote), but the status quo is pretty good for the GOP and they aren't persuaded by appeals to democratic ideals.

Transgendered individuals have serious and legitimate mental problems and they deserve clinical help to reverse their dysmorphia.,"Being trans leads people to take extreme amounts of hormones, drastic measures, and mutilating surgery all to blend in as the gender that they would like to be and it's rarely successful.

Sadie Adler from Red dead 2 is a bad character,"I think she's kind of a mary sue cause she gets away with so many stupid revenge fueled decisions while every other characters arc is about how their bad and selfish deeds result in their downfall.

Sadie only wants revenge for her whole arc. On people just for belonging to a gang. She gets balloon guy killed, almost gets Dutch and Arthur  killed at colms hanging and coerces Arthur into wiping out an o driscoll hide out all that for no good reason other than revenge.

At no point does the games story punish her for her behavior while all the other characters pay the price for the lifestyle especially when it's about revenge. Mostly of course Dutch, Arthur and John.

Arthur literally says ""Revenge is a fools game"".

It doesn't really feel like her character has some deep meaning compared to the other characters. She doesn't really fit into the story and its message. On the one hand the game wants to sell me the idea that Dutch is losing his mind by killing people out of rage and is responsible for the gang falling apart.

On the other hand the game wants to tell me that Sadie is a strong and likable woman who deserves success and happiness cause she killed dozens of people who did nothing to her and endangered her friends just cause of revenge.

It would have been better in my opinion if they made her into a full on dutch sympathizer with stockholm syndrome who becomes a gang member to deal with her trauma just like most of the other gang members and in the end meets the same fate. A lot of this is basically what happened but the game didn't treat her that way.  
It would fit her character more but I guess that one strong women had to be a good person cause wokeness.

"Gender either (1) doesn't exist, or (2) is useless","Definition of ‘gender’ for the context of this discussion (per the WHO)

&gt;Gender refers to the characteristics of women, men, girls and boys that are socially constructed.  This includes norms, behaviours and roles associated with being a woman, man, girl or boy, as well as relationships with each other. As a social construct, gender varies from society to society and can change over time.

(Just a quick note to those that say Gender = human male/female. If Gender is just used to describe sex, then it is pointless as well, beyond the small use of having an extra synonym).  

So here's the argument. As I see it, gender is essentially a whole bunch of stereotypes that were used to refer to the roles traditionally played by the male, or female sex. 

Allow me to draw this out so it is clear. Let’s take a group of stereotypes

-(A) Australian people are ugly 

-(B) Australian people are smart

-(C) Australian people like Oreos  

-(D) Australian people like to read

Now I have my collection of stereotypes, its time to turn them into a category. This is how I believe gender was created. So, let’s combine the stereotypes that were traditionally used to describe Australians and combine them into a new category. 

A+B+C+D+(any new stereotypes that come up) = Australian Gender

Now we can imagine at this point, people are still using the term Australian Gender to describe the stereotypes that have been traditionally associated with Australians. However, eventually some person came along and said that, in fact, Australian Gender has nothing to do with Australians at all. Australian Gender is just a set of arbitrary socially constructed norms (stereotypes). 

So, people start using “Australian” to refer to, (1) the original “Australian” that the stereotypes were describing, as well as (2) the category of “Australian (Gender)” that describes the stereotypes “Australian” people typically had. 

Now everyone is arguing about who has the correct definition of Australian, and whether or not ‘Australian’ should refer to (1), or (2). 

I would argue (1) is a pointless category. Because the traits that happened to become associated with Australians are totally arbitrary. And I don’t think we should be encouraging anyone to seek out/identity with/perpetuate stereotypes.

I would argue (2) is either pointless, or incoherent. It is pointless if (a) its just describing a collection of stereotypes. And it is incoherent if (b) its saying that, by virtue of sharing stereotypes with others, you join the category of the thing that was being stereotyped. 

(b) is incoherent because this is the logic it is using:

1. Most Australians act/feel/identity with A, B, C, D

2. I act/feel/identity with A, B, C, D

3. Therefore, I am Australian

The conclusion clearly does not follow from the premises.

So, long story short. I don’t think gender exists. And if it does exist, then its just a useless category describing old stereotypes. Either way, gender has to go.",u5lpge," You not liking a definition, or how it's applied, doe not change the definition, or make it ""useless"".

Criminal lawyers that get real criminals out of prison are unethical and act out of selfish interest (aka money).,"A relative of mine has been working as a criminal lawyer for a few years, I had never given much thought to it, but today I heard a conversation he was having on how he managed to get a gang member charged for murder out of prison and it sounded so dirty. Is there any reasonable ethical motivation for doing so? Other than getting innocent people that got mistakenly jailed free, I can't quite grasp how could a criminal lawyer be acting out of goodness and altruism. I'm sorry if I'm being ignorant, law being a family thing, I never really took any interest in getting to know how it really works.",ga460h,"Lawyers don't perform miracles out of thin air. Unless the lawyer is actively fabricating evidence (which they obviously shouldn't do), they are merely pointing out the weaknesses in the argument. Our justice system is designed around the fact that we need to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and if we can't do that, the person deserves to go free, even if you don't like that person, because you can't know if they have actually done it.

In the cases where it's clearly obvious that the defendant did it, lawyers don't get their clients free, but they are still needed to do things like preventing the prosecution from adding bogus charges on top of the actual crime to lengthen out the sentence.

In the US for example, it's pretty clear that the problem isn't that the prison sentences for criminals are too short, so lawyers, even the ones defending a real criminal, are ultimately a force for good. Even criminals are still people with rights and need someone to protect the rights they have.",foxrhm0
"Democracy's only real purpose is to prevent dictatorship, not represent the will of the people.","While I don't believe that democracy often represents the will of the people, I think it does do one thing very well - preventing dictatorships.

My reference is really only USA and Canadian politics, which don't seem to reflect the will of the people for various reasons. 

The two party system in the USA obviously only gives you two options of how the country should be run, and other than voting for a president, you have no participation in literally any major policy decision. Because there is no legal requirement for politicians to keep their promises re policy, you don't even really have your will represented when choosing who to vote for as there is no guarantee it will happen even where the winning president controls the house and senate. 

We then have issues with the electoral system in both countries, where the popular vote means nothing.

All that being said, I've recently come to believe democracy does do one thing really well, which is of course to prevent dictatorships. An issue with my argument comes down to the term limits which aren't inherent to all democracies but are imposed by the USA Constitution, which may be the real reason dictatorship cannot occur. For instance, we can imagine a country in which term limits exist and dictatorship isn't present, though you cannot vote for a leader. 

However, in Canada there is actually no limit on how many terms a prime minister can serve, and we still see changing leadership regardless. I'd like to believe that democracy provides more benefits than preventing dictatorship, but I just don't really see how it can. All that being said, I'm actually happier now recognizing that I should stop expecting so much from democracy, and that we should really be celebrating that our democracies only prevent dictatorship. Especially in light of Putin, I'm now more accepting of having trump win again because I know it won't be forever.

I also think viewing democracy in this way would further reduce polarization between citizens, as we instead focus on the temporal nature of the leadership, instead of the fact that our team lost this time.",t4m738,"A democracy is a government where people have the legislative control (either direct or through representatives).

"The word ""savage"" is not inherently offensive when used in the proper context.","I was talking to someone about the word ""savage"" and they tried telling me that since white people called natives savages when they invaded Canada, that nobody should ever use that word again, it's their word to use and nobody elses. I agreed that you obviously shouldnt call a native person a savage but it's not a harmful word when used in the proper context.

I tried saying that if a news program featured a story with a title along the lines of ""man found savagely beaten"", that's fine and shouldnt offend natives. She disagreed and said I was ignorant. Is this true? Am I wrong? I dont want to offend people by using a seemingly normal word.

Edit: pretend I didnt say the word ""inherently"".",c1q4de,"Opiniony issues like this are hard to argue for or against, because the thing with taking offense to something, is that you don't really get to decide for other people whether they find something offensive or not. **Everything is simultaneously offensive and non-offensive**, because some people will find it offensive, and others people will find it non-offensive. Neither group is entirely correct; they both represent two halves of the correct whole.

So back to your point: ""the word savage is not inherently offensive"". That is what is called a tautology: something which is always true because of the way you worded it. Why is it always true? Because you used the word ""inherent"", which means ""innate"". Offense is NOT something which is inherent or innate; it is something which is perceived and felt. So the statement ""____ word is not **inherently** offensive"" is always true, because nothing inherently carries offense, as offense requires a subject to perceive it.",erf3x7q
Destiny’s Child was a better girl group than TLC,"This may seem like a silly topic, but this is an argument me and my best friend have been having since we were kids and I thought it’d be an interesting topic. While TLC is legendary, I think Destiny’s Child was much better.

1. Better Singers: Beyonce, Kelly and Michelle were way more talented than Tboz, Left Eye and Chilli. TLC were never known for being vocally talented and could never compete with them in singing battle.

2. Better Solo Careers: Obviously Beyonce is one of the biggest stars in the world, but Kelly Rowland has also had pretty good success as a solo artist. Michelle Williams has done pretty well in gospel music as well. TLC really haven’t been as successful by themselves.

3. Better Music: This point is more subjective, but Destiny’s Childs songs are just much better to me. “Say My Name”, “Independent Women”, “Survivor”, “Girl”, “Cater 2 U” we’re all hits that are still relevant and played today. You really only hear “Waterfalls” and “No Scrubs” from TLC today.",ntcp9d,Red Light Special and What About Your Friends are two other great TLC bops.,h0rcj0r
Laws that require you to call the police upon witnessing a crime violate the 5th amendment,"Some states have laws that make it a crime to not call the police if you witness a crime and have access to a phone.

In my view, this violates the 5th amendment. Usually when investigators can't get a lead on who committed a crime, they will look to the person who reported it. [Richard Jewell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Jewell) suffered this fate when he was accused of bombing the Olympics because he reported it, but luckily he was not convicted and the real bomber eventually confessed. Unfortunately, I am certain that many innocent people *have* suffered a similar fate and were convicted.

Because of this tendency for the police to automatically suspect the reporter of a crime as the potential criminal, you are making yourself a suspect by calling the police, which is an act of self-incrimination. And yes, innocent people can incriminate themselves: the Supreme Court has even said:

&gt;one of the Fifth Amendment's basic functions is to protect innocent men who otherwise might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.

To me, any laws that apply to regular everyday citizens (not government employees) which compel them to call the police if they witness a crime are unconstitutional for this reason.

It is not ableist to say it’s inevitable that everyone is going to get Covid.,"I’ve seen a few posts insisting that accepting that Covid will likely become endemic is discriminatory against chronically ill and disabled people. Their point is that not everyone can afford to get Covid and be ok. 

I understand that due to Omicron being more contagious, but also more mild for vaccinated people, the amount of cases alone will effect how many people are hospitalized and how many die from complications. I Am in no way saying we should throw all caution to the wind and try not to mitigate spread and protect vulnerable people. But statistically, it is very likely that even with precautions, this virus will eventually infect a majority of the population, and the majority of them will be fine. 

I do not think it is discriminatory against chronically Ill people for vaccinated people to exclusively gather with other vaccinated people without as many restrictions, and it is not a ableist for individuals to accept the risk that they may get sick and be ok. That’s like saying it’s ableist to stand up and walk in front of someone who has to live in a wheelchair. I really feel for them, but I will not put the breaks on my life because they may suffer worse consequences than I would from doing normal things.",rx22l5,"""accept the risk and be ok""

I was marching right with you agreeing with you until that line. ""be ok""... That is a hope, not a fact.

You hope you will be ok and not dead.

You hope its Omicron and not Delta.

You hope you wont infect 70 other people.

You hope it wont kill some of those people.

So, in my estimation, ignoring safety measures because you hope it wont get anyone hurt is similar to ignoring the speed limit because you hope no one will get hurt.

*Endemic does not mean we can stop using safety measures.*

Highways are ""endemic"", and they kill a lot of people every year. Less so because we use safety measures. Most grown adults look down on speeding and reckless driving, they know the hidden costs that other people will eventually pay for this one persons ""extra freedom to be unsafe"". I think most grown adults who aren't drinking QoolAid feel the same way about people who wont get vaxxed or wear a mask in crowded situations.

**And now about that whole brakes on your life thing.** Has anything bad EVER happened to you? Because you seem to think getting a shot at the doc and wearing a mask are impinging on your ability to live your life. You are actually stating this in the same sentence while talking about someone who literally had a life stopping moment and ended up in a wheelchair... a surprizing lack of empathy and perspective. Imagine telling that person in the wheelchair that you have had a life stopping issue with  wearing a mask/vax. Wearing a mask and vaxxing up is not putting the brakes on your life. Whoever told you that wants your vote and doesn't care if you live until the next vote. Getting your neck broken, that will put the brakes on your life. Getting run over by a car will put the brakes on your life.

***Also, getting a bad case of covid will put the brakes on your life.***

I can't even count the number of people who, on their death bed, told everyone how wrong they were and how they wished they hadn't been drinking QoolAid.

I hope you never come to realize just how lucky you are to be able to actually say out-loud ""the brakes are on my life because vax/mask."" Because that would mean something that actually does put the brakes on your life happened, giving you the perspective to see that this barely makes the ""minor annoyance"" list. I don't wish you ill, ***I hope you gain that perspective without the pain that comes first.***",hrhfzyi
We should have a cap on personal wealth," 

Been thinking about this a lot recently. It seems to me a lot of today’s problems are a result of the ever widening gap between rich and poor. Essentially, if all the World’s wealth is a big pie, the rich are taking a bigger slice each year. 

In a 2016 report, [Oxfam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfam) found that the wealth of the planet’s poorest 95% dropped by 38% between 2010 and 2015, while the wealth of the richest 62 people increased by $500bn to $1.76tn. 

The following year, a census by Wealth-X showed that the number of billionaires on the planet had increased to 2,754, and they had a combined wealth of $9.2tn. To put this in context, it’s more than three times the UK’s GDP. That’s the UK, people! The 7th richest country on the planet and home to 66 million people. 

Now I understand that people have different opinions about this, but surely even the most die-hard, laissez-faire capitalist can see that this might be a problem?

So why not just have a cap on personal wealth? I’m not suggesting we stop capitalism all together. Just that once people accumulate a billion, for example, the rest should go to the State to be used for the benefit of everyone else. And for the purposes of this argument, let’s just assume that most countries are able to effectively distribute wealth amongst their citizens (because whether they actually can or not is a discussion for another day). 

It’s not like your average multi-billionaire can spend all that money. Once they’ve bought a mansion, a couple of holiday homes and a fleet of cars, there’s still a large wad of unused cash left. And if they’re using the remainder to buy influence and maintain power, that tends to ensure that it’s harder for the rest of us to climb up the ladder.

Maybe it’s just because I’ve spent far too long reflecting on my own paultry wealth, but this feels like a common sense idea. Anyway, over to you guys to tell me that I’m stupid.",c8g7bq,"One issue is with your view of wealth, you talk about piles of cash lying around. The rich don't particularly have a crazy amount of cash, their wealth is linked to what they own. Bill Gates doesn't have $60 Billion sitting in his bank account, he owns shares in Microsoft and those shares are valuable. This applies to most of the super wealthy.

Therefore to cap wealth you'd have to cap ownership either redistributing it  or making it the property of the state, neither of these things are economically efficient. 

I believe in capitalism, I think it's helped everyone, I think those living in poverty today are far better off than those living in poverty just a hundred years ago and that is positive. But believing in capitalism means that i have to accept that there will be disparity between the people, some will be super wealthy some will be super poor. Is this perfect? No. Is it better than the alternative? Quite possibly.",esrsu1q
"Voting for the lesser of two evils is still choosing evil, and therefore wrong.","I’m in my thirties &amp;amp; apolitical. I have never voted. I considered it briefly in 2008 because Obama had a very JFK vibe going in addressing the public, but even then, I couldn’t be swayed. I literally *hate* politics. I hate the division it causes amongst the masses. I especially hate it this year, the worst election season that I’ve seen yet. I have stayed off of Facebook and most social media since summertime because I find it all very draining. 

I don’t want to vote (and don’t believe it would matter if I did), but I gave in and registered and eventually was persuaded into requesting a ballot this year — very late, but it’s here now. I basically agreed to *maybe* vote on behalf of my closest friends and family who are completely in my face about it (much like the rest of the world). The entire reason my friends/fam insist I vote is because of being in a swing state, as if I alone have some sheer power to change the outcome of the election (plz spare me Margaret Mead quote). 

I don’t agree with *ANY* candidates, so why the hell should I vote for them? Is choosing the lesser of two evils not still choosing evil? Why should I vote for Trump? Why should I vote for Biden? If I weren’t to vote for either, what would be the point of voting at all? I don’t fall into any political spectrum. I would lean toward libertarianism if I had to be classified, but even that doesn’t fit me (though it’s where I’d likely place my vote if I voted). I’ve yet to hear any compelling argument (for any candidate) other than, “this is the most pressing election of our lifetimes!” Why? It’s certainly the most annoying, and participating in something I don’t agree with or voting for either left/right paradigm candidate, both of whom I oppose, surely seems to be in direct conflict with my own morals and values.

Bizarrely, despite sticking to my beliefs all of these years, I actually feel GUILTY about my opinions and moral stance because of my friends and family. As if I owe it to them to vote. This election has been shoved down my throat even despite my best attempts to avoid it. I get approx 10 political texts daily, and countless emails. I get mail right to my door as well, every single day, from a whole slew of politicians. But I’ve yet to be truly convinced in any meaningful way. About any of “them” or from anyone. 

I personally don’t believe my vote counts regardless of if I opted for one of the players on the main stage / and it surely doesn’t count if I vote otherwise. I’ve also not been convinced of who I would vote for considering their whole spiel is “swing state!!!” Those pressuring me to vote are equally divided on the “popular” candidate —- and get this, I don’t believe that any of them are “bad people” because of that, even despite that I believe both candidates are flat out wrong  (and perhaps actually the true bad people). 

I’m honestly opting to have this discussion because I genuinely want my view(s) to be changed. I am not playing devil’s advocate. I really would like to feel morally comfortable with voting. Part of me feels that I should opt toward the democratic option on behalf of my best friend, who is gay. But — is there really any *actual* evidence that the re-election ot Trump would harm gay rights anyway? If so, why wouldn’t those actions have been put into place during his present term? So much conflicting information and it seems like half of the information regarding each candidate is just assumptions and hate from the opposing parties supporters. I’m also of the opinion that it’s one big club and we aren’t part of it. It surely makes it impossible to make any responsible decision, and only further deters me from participating in what I can only see as a big charade. I actually would ultimately feel even more guilty if I voted for either of the big dogs and either one ended up doing something horrific. For example, I don’t agree with war (self defense is different, IMO)— but we will get war whether “we” elect Tweedledee or Tweedledum. And then I will feel that innocent lives lost are partially my responsibility. It seems much safer to just not vote!",jmjzrr,"It might make more sense to you if think of it less in terms of ""big evil vs. little evil."" The best analogy I ever read for participating in one's own democracy is comparing it to a marriage vs. taking the bus. It sounds wild, but bear with me.

Voting in an election is not a marriage. You are not painstakingly vetting the candidates and listening to their proposals in the hopes that you nail your one and only chance to find ""The One."" Instead, voting is like taking the bus. Let's say you need to be somewhere on the other side of town. You check your municipal bus schedule only to learn that sadly, the best option you have actually drops you off 5-6 blocks from your final destination. Now, if you need to be at that location for something like a job interview, what are you gonna do? Throw up your hands in defeat and say, ""Well, fuck it, none of the buses take me where I actually want to go so I guess I'll just stay home!""? No. I mean you could, but more than likely you're gonna leave a little earlier and walk the extra blocks to get to where you have to be to make your appointment on time. Then you can fill out a feedback form on your local transit authority's website and advocate for an extension of the bus route to start dropping you off at that location. Who knows, if enough people like you need a bus to run to that particular location, you might all collectively get what you're hoping for.

Choosing to participate in an election or not is your constitutionally protected right and people like ourselves are fortunate enough to live in countries where we have that right and are not persecuted by the government based on how we choose to exercise it. Because yes, politics sucks, there are hardly never any really good candidates and I would argue that most citizen role their eyes so hard they give themselves a headache every time they think about having to vote in yet another god damn election. I share many of the feelings you expressed at the beginning of your post about organized religion, but that's a post for another time. So I feel that if you really don't want to participate, it's your right not to and no one can take that away from you. 

But democracy is a fragile thing. In the Western world we've forgotten that. We've gotten so used to it that we really do take it for granted. Especially in a country of 330 million+ people, it's very easy to believe that your one tiny vote doesn't mean a thing. And at a microcosmic level it doesn't. But this leads me to my next point - thinking macro instead of micro when it comes to elections.

I live in Canada and am also in my 30s. I have a handful of friends very similar to you. They hate politics and have never voted in a federal election. Their reasoning for not participating can often be boiled down to ""none of the candidates really represent the things I want."" And my response to them is that the reason their platforms don't reflect your values is *because* we don't vote. Throughout the histories of both our countries, the lowest voter turnout is often in the age range of 18-35. Now, reasons for this can include a broad spectrum of things including general political apathy amongst younger voters who for the most part don't yet own their own house or run their own business and therefore don't have much skin in the game to younger people's tendencies to be more attracted to fringe or radical politics not often reflected by the major political parties. 

However, regardless of the reasons why young people don't vote in nearly as high numbers as other age groups, we (the ""youths"", I mean) have been going about how to change that all wrong for years. We simply think the answer is to rebel and just not show up at all. But this literally accomplishes nothing because politics is a big ol' game of analytics.

See, countries collect data on all of their citizens who are of eligible voting age. There is a lot of data they can't collect (for example, they're not allowed to keep any kind of record on who you actually voted for) but as I'm sure you noticed on your registration they do collect data on age range, marital status, gender identity, living situation, and family status. This data is all boiled down in to representative metrics and political parties/candidates create their platforms and campaign strategies based on which metric they believe they will most likely side with them come election day. One of the most important metrics for these people is another piece of data the government can collect, and that is *voter turnout*.

Basically, if you list your age as 30 when you register to vote, they put you in the same metric as all the other 30 y/o registered voters. They then add this number together to see roughly how many people in that age group across the country should theoretically show up to the polls. When you do show up, you present your ID to prove who you are, they cross you off the list of registered voters, and you become part of the percentage of that metric that actually showed up. And in the last two Canadian federal elections, we didn't do too bad with the younger generations. In 2019, 68% of registered voters aged 18-24 showed up. This was way better than the 55% that showed up just two elections previously in 2011. Amongst the 25-34 year old demographic,  71% in 2019 vs. just 59% in 2011. 

And I hope you can see the benefit of those increases because they're key to the point I'm trying to make. Why would a politician or political party cater their platform to 18-24 year olds when, historically, barely half of them even bother to show up to vote in the first place? They wouldn't. They would cater their platform to the 55-64 and 65-74 year old demographics that routinely post 80% or above turnout rates every. Bloody. Election. This creates a never-ending and self-fulfilling loop in which younger people feel there are no suitable candidates who care about what they think and therefore choose not to vote at all and the politicians see those low turnout numbers and continue not to cater to younger voters. However, over the last couple of elections, more and more politicians from all three major parties in Canada have started to more actively cater to younger voters (with promises of stonger commitments to climate action, for example) based on the upward trend of our voting turnout.

Quite simply, and to connect it to my first point, the only way to get politicians and political parties to start changing their platforms to better suit your views is to show them statistical that you are a demographic worth catering to. And to offer some icing on the cake to my Canadian friends, I then inform them that it is perfectly legal to ""reject your ballot"". 

Rejecting your ballot is a criminally under discussed/promoted process in which you go to your polling station, business as usual. You present your ID, they cross your name off the list, and then present you with a ballot. However, instead of accepting the ballot and heading to the voting both, you can say something along the lines of ""I would like to formally reject my ballot."" They are then legally obligated to put your blank ballot in an envelope and add it to a pile of other rejected ballots. At the end of the night, rejected ballots are counted and broken down in to similar percentages based on all the same metrics I talked about earlier. Therefore, there is a statistic that shows how many people in a particular age range rejected their ballot. Of course rejected ballots aren't sexy so they are never featured on the big television spectacles that occur come election night. But the politicians themselves can access those numbers.

So consider a scenario in which 83% of registered voters aged 18-24 actually show up to the polls and present their IDs and have their names crossed off the list. However, the losing politician notices that of the 83% that at least got far enough off their couches to show up to the polls, 29% of them actually rejected their ballots. This would tell that politician that there is actually a not insignificant chunk of a very politically active demographic that remains undecided on who they actually want to cast their ballot for. Seeing an opportunity, the politician then refocuses his or her campaign to figuring out what that 29% of ballot rejectors would actually like to see in their government and working on trying to snap up those undecided voters come the next election. BUT! If that 29% of ballot rejectors just hadn't shown up at all, the only statistic that same politician would see is that only 54% of all registered 18-24 year olds showed up to vote and thus the cycle continues. And this is what I mean when I talk about thinking micro vs. thinking macro. 

Now, I don't know if rejecting your ballot works the same way in the US as it does north of the border (although I'm sure you could find out), but regardless, I hope I've illustrated to you the power you actually have by simply showing up with your peers to show ""the powers that be"" that you want change and the power to choose who governs could very well rest in your collective hands.

Apologies for the novel but I hope that even some of this helped you change your perspective on what it means to live in and participate in a democracy. But at the end of the day, I support whatever choice you make and will defend to the death your right to make to make it - because that's what democracy is all about.",gaw5569
The concept of an omniscient (*) and capable creator is not compatible with that of free will.,"For this argument to work, omniscient minimally entails that this creator knows what will ever happen.

Hence the (\*).

Capable means that this creator can create as it wishes. 

1) Such a creator knows everything that will happen with every change it makes to its creation. Nothing happens unexpectedly to this creator.

2) Free will means that one is ultimately the origin of their decisions and physical or godly forces are not.

This is a clear contradiction; these concepts are not compatible. The creator cannot know everything that will ever happen if a person is an origin of decisions.

I smoke DMT pretty regularly. Once, it showed me what is essentially the fabric of time. It's shaped like a 2D mesh of triangles connecting at their vertices. Each vertex represents a moment in time where something with free will could continue down either path. Usually two, sometimes 3. I never perceived a segment with more options than this. The fabric itself is infinite. A far greater infinite than the infinite of our spatial universe - as this fabric must contain every possible universe.

When you make a decision, you aren't so much changing the future as you are choosing which path your present continues along. Wher eyou go left, another version of you goes right. More so, all times exist simultanneously, much like how the end of a road exists at the same time as the beginning of the road.

Your consciousness gets to choose which path to take. There were only two options in this instance, and both options exist and have already been executed fully. You aren't choosing which one exists, you are only choosing which one your consciousness rides.

So, in an infinite fabric of time, every decision you have ever made or ever will make already exists. This doesn't mean your will is limited - you still get to choose which path you take through this infinite mesh.

I hope that made sense.. I did the best I could.. I am only a 3D creature speaking on the infinity of a theoretical 4D entity, after all.

Hiking in sandals is stupid and dangerous.,"I understand hiking dunes or sandy areas in sandals. But I've been on the Appalachian trail recently and seen a lot of people hiking in sandals. I feel that it's just asking for an injury. One wrong step and a twig or rock can cut your foot wide open, while the padding from a shoe or boot may save you from even noticing it. I've heard the argument that you just have to watch where you step, but if you have to stare at the ground constantly make sure you aren't going to be injured then it's inefficient and dangerous. Is there something I'm missing? Am I just weirdly clumsy? I have a lot of hiking experience in different terrains but see little to no value in hiking in sandals, save for beach areas.",nk373c,"Maybe the 'stupidity' is less about what footwear is chosen than whether or not one has properly informed oneself about the track and to be expected conditions.

"Trump was never a politician, a racist, or even a populist. He was simply the most successful con artist in American history.","I do believe Trump is racist, but not any more racist that any other 75-80 year old man. At his very worst 30/40 years ago he’d be considered a liberal. 

Trump inherited a fortune, which adjusted for inflation would probably be less than his  current net worth. By all accounts he made some decent investments on real estate in the 70’s, albeit backed by tax payer money. However, all of his other business ideas and businesses for the next 2 decades flopped miserably. He may be the most litigated man in American history. 

By the early 90’s Donald Trump was a punch line in late night comedy shows. Banks wouldn’t loan him money, and he became more or less a B List celebrity. He was a professional wrestler, appeared in popular sitcoms, starred in Pizza Hut commercials, and made brief cameos in popular movies.

Ironically it was playing a successful businessman on a reality TV show that revived the viability of the Trump brand. The producer of the wildly successful Survivor series wanted to create a business world equivalent of Survivor, and wanted to use Trump for name recognition. Initially Trump thought of reality television as beneath himself, but thought of it as a free way to promote the Trump brand. Trump had been inept in the business world for 2 decades by this point, and the producer thought his office was tacky and dated to the 70’s so they built him a fake contemporary office. 

The show was wildly successful and marketed Trump to the masses as a successful businessman. He was able to make his brand solvent by licensing his name to properties the world over, and claiming he owned these properties with his name plastered everywhere. 
 
It was around this time that Barack Obama had succeeded the historically unpopular Bush 2. Trump made himself the political Skip Bayless. He opposed anything Obama from his birth certificate to his healthcare plan. He became a fixture on conservative news media for his anti Obama stances on everything.  

Trump became the darling of the Republican primaries. He said things other Republicans would only imply. There were a demographic of Americans that hated Obama and what he represented and Trump’s strategy was to tap into that hate. He famously promised to “ban all Muslims”, promised to build a border wall, and called Mexicans drug dealing rapists. He was all marshmallows no lucky charms. His years of pro wrestling and reality television made him the perfect political heel. Down to the chants and juvenile name calling. Pocahontas, Lying Ted, Sleepy Joe, “Build the Wall”, “Lock Her Up”…once he got some momentum he hired white nationalist Steve Bannon to be his top advisor and doubled down on everything that made him successful.

My theory is that Trump never intended to be president. He just wanted to shake up the system and promote his brand. Actually being elected president was a burden he didn’t anticipate. Ultimately being president revived the viability of his brand, and despite his comical incompetence he could hire qualified people to keep the machine operating. Once he acquired the highest level of celebrity and power he ever achieved power was not something he’d readily relinquish. The byproduct of his success is that the right has become a political sideshow, and their biggest celebrities are the most politically viable. The most batshit crazy right wing nuts have the biggest followings.",vsj74k,"*""not any more racist that any other 75-80 year old man""*

&amp;#x200B;

""75-80"" year olds, statistically, would have been old enough in the 60s and early 70s to have served in the Vietnam War. While people have a variety of reasons to have served in it, one of many is the ideal of protecting the freedoms of the South Vietnamese from Ho Chi Minh. (Putting aside that the propaganda was somewhat misleading and Infographics Show made a good case the USA fought on the wrong side.) Of the ones who *didn't* fight, many of them were hippies who burned their draft cards; many of whom were known for showing solidarity with the civil rights movement.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, Asians are a subject of more positive stereotypes than Hispanics, to be fair, and the stereotypes of African-Americans are more mixed. Still, I don't think people willing to put their lives on the line for Vietnamese people's freedoms are statistically as racist as a guy who would build a career out of accusing Mexico of sending rapists. Let alone do so after invoking bone spurs to get out of serving in the military.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, maybe the boomer generation *became* racist over the years (don't know how to confirm *or* refute that) and maybe Trump somehow knew how best to pander to them, even though he didn't know when he was being recorded, didn't know that spitballing ridiculous crap about using bleach to treat coronavirus would blow up in his face, etc... but it seems more likely that for it to even *occur* to him to use such brazenly racist talking points as the Mexico one, he had to be especially racist of his own accord as well.

As a vegan the morally consistent thing for me to do would be to continue to be pro-life.,"I don't believe it is morally ethical to kill a sentient being that does not want to die. I've had some cognitive dissonance reconciling that with my participation in the mass slaughter of farm animals for a long time but I have recently decided to align my morals with my actions &amp; become vegan.

I have also been pro-life for many years. I'm open to the idea of an abortion at the early stages of pregnancy before a fetus has any form of sentience or in cases where the life of the mother is at risk but after that develops I think it would be morally inconsistent for me to defend someone's ability to end that sentient being.  

I don't believe there is any way to be vegan for moral reasons while also being pro-choice at a stage in pregnancy where the fetus has sentience. 

A human fetus with sentience has separate DNA from the mother. It is another living beings contained within the mother. If that separate living being has sentience and does not want to die it would be incompatible with vegan ethics to kill it. 

CMV",eafi9b,"A right to bodily autonomy is generally considered more primary than a right to life when the two conflict.  For instance, a vegan would probably feel fine with the removal of a tape worm even if that results in the worm's death.  But a vegan wouldn't deliberately kill an Earth worm just for the sake of it.

There are examples for humans too.  You can't be forced to give up a kidney even if someone's life depended on it. Abortion is very much like this.",faqk59g
Having e-numbers in ingredients is better than having full name,"Food products have now days turned away from using e-numbers in their ingredient lists and prefer to use common names. This might be to be more consistent with US market or in hopes to appear more natural. E-numbers have been demonised as something evil, but I liked it more when there was list of e-numbers. Companies have not changed their products just the labelling. Here are my arguments of having e-numbers.

1. It’s easier to google E432 than Polyoxyethene (20) sorbitan monolaurate. Putting four letters sends you to right page right away. Try typing full name without errors while looking at products in supermarket.
2. Common name is no more “natural” than e-number. [Banana has 50 e-numbers in it](https://jameskennedymonash.wordpress.com/2013/12/12/ingredients-of-an-all-natural-banana/). And if component is in your product it must be labelled.
3. Common name is misleading unless further explained. If you know how e-numbers work, you know that numbers starting with 2 are preservatives. But having just name Sodium propionate doesn’t tell anything why it’s in my cake.
4. Shorter and easier to read. Just like it’s easier to google e-numbers it’s easier to read them and separate them from other ingredients.

Now best solution is to have both names. But if you have to pick one over other, I would pick e-number any day. To change my view tell me what the real benefit of having full/common name instead of e-number.

\[Edit\] It shouldn't have come to me as surprise but it seems like lot of people don't know what e-numbers are and what they mean but they still think they have something to say on the issue. Now before you post, I recommend that you look into e-numbers and they actually are. They are numbers to assigned to food grade additives. Things like guar gum or lycopene (red colour). They are not assigned to ingredients like sugar, flour or carrots because those are not additives. Every ingredient must be listed but you can shorten long chemical names of additives and use short e-number instead (with often explanation of it's usage like preservative E282).",lf7znb,"In your proposal is the whole list e-numbers? Like, it seems obvious to me that whole ingredients and allergens ought to still be listed as their common names... because people need to quickly be able to identify if a food has an allergen or other offensive ingredient. Maybe e-numbers are better for identifying other compounds, but the whole point of ingredient labels is to make it quick and easy for a consumer to identify what is in their food.",gml4zun
The plastic bag ban is kind of a scam,"I'll start off by saying that I am a supporter of reducing our plastic reliance and use, and started cutting back my own usage dramatically a year ago. I just wanted to put that out there first. 

Now to the main part of why I personally think that while the plastic bag ban is a good step for the environment, it's a money-making scam.  While they took away the ability to receive ""unlimited"" free plastic bags, they just replaced them with thicker ""reusable"" plastic bags that you can now purchase for 10-15 cents depending on the store. 

1) It makes no sense to ban something, only to bring back a slightly more improved version of it that you now charge 10-15 cents per bag. (I understand that the fee is meant to discourage people from purchasing a bag, and bringing their own, but I've yet to see that happen in the 4 years it has been in effect here in LA)

2) While they banned the plastic bag for bagging your groceries, they did nothing to actually ban all of the smaller bags that are used for produce. There isn't a single time I go to the store where I don't see people bagging PRE-PACKAGED items into those tiny produce bags. Boxes of strawberry that are already boxed into plastic containers, mushrooms that are already inside of plastic containers and plastic-wrapped, pre-packed salad bags. It seems to me that these bags are a much bigger problem now than the plastic grocery bags. 

3) If you're banning plastic bags, why are you suddenly also charging for paper bags that were completely free? Why wouldn't you just shift the use of plastic to the use of paper bags, which are much easier to recycle? Again I understand this is meant to drive people away from purchasing the bags, but at least here in LA, it doesn't seem to stop anyone. Not to mention most people purchase the plastic bag over the paper bag. Maybe if the paper bag was free, it would be more of an incentive to not purchase or use the plastic bags? Or maybe just provide paper bags only and don't give people an option at all to purchase a plastic bag.

4) Many stores only offer plastic bags for purchase upon request and not paper bags. This makes absolutely no sense as it is called a plastic bag ban. Not a ""you can still get plastic bags from convenience stores and grocery stores but you just pay for them"" ban. Why would the only option be to purchase a plastic bag... when they banned plastic bags? 

5) This is more of just an unbacked view but, it feels like stores just saw a chance to make even more money and took it.

If someone could change my view on this I would appreciate it, because as of right now I fail to see how simply banning the grocery bags has been as effective, when people are still allowed to take as many produce bags as they wish. The only stats I have seen to support this ban has been for the usage of grocery bags, but fails to take into account he produce bags.

Edit:

I realize I may have not properly explained my position. 

I am not arguing against or denying that the “ban” has been effective, that is evident by the statistics. I appreciate all of the links as well. 

My point is that it is not truly a ban, but more so a way for them to appease both sides. They “ban” plastic bags for those of us who care to reduce plastic waste, but they then just sell them to you instead, and keep the plastic companies happy. 

Here is a link to the FAQ about the ban in California:

https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/plastics/carryoutbags/faq#1.

And here is the section that backs up why I think that while effective, this is a scam:


1) How much do stores have to charge for a reusable grocery bag or a recycled paper bag?

Stores must charge at least 10 cents per bag. They may charge more than that, but they cannot charge less. The fee is to ensure that the cost of providing grocery bags is not subsidized by customers who bring their own bags or otherwise do not require bags.

2) Who keeps the proceeds from the sale of reusable grocery bags and recycled paper bags?

The stores that sell the bags keep the money and must use it to cover the costs of providing the bags, complying with the bag ban, or encouraging the use of reusable grocery bags through educational materials or an educational campaign.

Again, if you’re going to ban plastic bags, then ban them and don’t bring them back for sale. Charge customers to offer paper bags instead, or sell actual reusable bags. But that fee to me is just another way for them to continue making money, while the plastic companies continue getting their cut as well.",g1ddzv,"This is late to the party but I've been working at a grocery store in Oregon so I have a few insights.

1. Having a fee absolutely discourages people from buying bags they otherwise would have taken. Even such a small fee has made people avoid bags altogether, or buy fewer bags

2. We are selling bags at a loss. Paper bags cost us 8¢ and well sell them for 5¢ I believe the plastic reusable are around the same margin. This is not making the stores additional money, they're just losing less.

3. People bring back in the reusable bags. They last quite awhile compared to the old ones. It's April and I have yet to see any of the sturdier plastic ones rip but the single use sometimes didn't make it home after one trip.

4. It's way easier to make stores change policies on bags than manufacturers. Yes it sucks that theres still too much plastic in stores. Hopefully we can start chopping away at that. Aldis is saying that all manufacturers have to be non plastic by 2025. But its very easy to make stores change the policies on bags and that does have a meaningful effect.",fnic61b
gifted high school entrance should be based on objective test scores only,"if you're a resident of NYC like i am, you might be familiar with the debate that's been occurring here for a few years now ever since the mayor and school chancellor started bringing it up. if you're not, the situation is that there are 8 specialized (or gifted) high schools that require certain scores on a standardized test before being admitted. if you don't get a high enough score for one of these gifted high schools, you are enrolled in your zoned high school. for the purposes of this CMV, i'll focus on the top rated school, stuyvesant, but most of the gifted schools have the same issue more or less.  

that issue is the racial disparity in these gifted schools. at stuyvesant a recent class of 800, 1% was black, 3% was hispanic, 19% was white and a whopping 74% was asian. 

city-wide, the breakdown of public school students is 41% hispanic, 26% black, 16% asian and 15% white. (a big chunk of the city's white kids goto private school). 

given the wide racial disparity, you may conclude that there is something fishy going on with regards to racial discrimination whether overt or not. the mayor and schools chancellor have stated a preference to eliminate the standardized test in favor of a more holistic approach taking into account other more subjective factors (such as teacher recs) in determining admission as well as offering automatic admission to top grade getters at each of the city's middle schools. 

as a parent of a child who will be attending public school (god-willing in person) in the near future, i have considered this carefully and have come to the conclusion that it would be wrong to change the current method of admission. some priors of mine worth mentioning:

- i believe fair access to school is a near fundamental right
- the idea of having gifted programs/schools can be good and bad but on the balance is much more on the side of good
- access to these gifted schools should be as meritocratic as possible
- gifted programs should maintain the highest academic standards possible
- practicality is an important factor in making anything happen in this city. the biggest thing here is that the population will likely not accept much higher taxes (they are high already) or power grab by the mayor (away from the city council or state). 

here are some arguments (and counter-points) of the pro ""get rid of the test"" camp. 

1\. the test is either overtly or covertly racist/classist. 

* the test, as i know it, is comprised of a math section and a reading/revising (ie. english) portion. i don't know how math questions can be racist so i will skip over that, but i can see how in certain ways an english question could potentially be racist or classist. for instance, if a reading passage is about yachting, it'd be more unlikely that a black kid from harlem will be familiar with yachting terms rather than a white kid from battery park city. but as far as i know, this was brought up decades ago and the test has gone through many revisions to eliminate this kind of bias as much as possible. now no process is 100% fool-proof but given the scrutiny this issue has received over the years, i find it difficult to believe any significant issue of this type still exists in the test today. in my mind, the test itself is not racist. it is as objective as possible in determining aptitude in math and english. 

2\. kids with means who get tutors have an unfair advantage.

* it is true that the affluent have the ability to hire one-on-one tailored tutoring and test prep, giving them a sizable advantage. however two things make this moot for me. first, the city has offered through partners free test prep for any student who needs it (there may be a means-test, i'm not sure). second, something approaching 50% of stuyvesant students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. this indicates to me that money is not the be-all/end-all factor that others think. 

3\. admittance should not be based on a single test for *X* reason

* i totally agree that a child's full potential or aptitude can NOT be captured by a single exam on a single day. however, given there are over a million students in nyc (and around 100k matriculating into hs each year) it would take a monumental increase in bureaucracy to handle the evaluation and admission decisions of that many students. it would also introduce subjective factors which i believe would open the process up to unfair bias and abuse. a standardized test is the most objective method of determining admission that is reasonably practical. the proposal that top grade getters would automatically gain admission is tempting on its face, but grades at each school are still dependent on subjective factors that could easily jeopardize the academic standards of the schools. also, it's my belief that this idea will not dramatically change the racial makeup of these schools, as it is likely that some families with the means will move to certain schools to try and secure those top spots. 

4\. the current situation of racial disparity needs to be fixed

* this one i totally agree with, but what i disagree on is the methods used to fix it. the ones who want to switch from the test argue that the test point is where the issue needs to be fixed, whereas i think it is just the symptom of the problem and not the underlying cause. while the exact cause may be difficult to pin down, i think it is clear that it starts earlier. disparities in resources/wealth/race between schools and districts cause divisions and can hamper a kid's potential down the line. universal pre-k was one step in the right direction (one of the very few things i can give de blasio credit for) and i expect that it will equalize the racial disparities to a minor degree down the line. but more efforts towards real school integration would be a bigger catalyst to fix this situation.


it's a complex issue and i've gotten into many heated arguments about this, so would be happy to discuss (in good faith) and maybe CMV.

*edited for some typos*",il8k6z,"I think you're missing the elephant in the room here: the parents. The purpose of public schooling is to identify the children with the greatest potential and give them access to the resources and instruction to achieve that potential. The system as it stands, tests and all, does nothing but identify the children of parents with the greatest knowledge of how to get these things for their children. Sure, a first generation Chinese immigrant whose parents own a restaurant in Queens could qualify for free lunch, but the fact is that she was more likely to succeed on that test because her parents knew 1) that that test is important, coming from a culture where everything rides of exams 2) where to access help and 3) live in a neighborhood with a cram school on every block. I would say that privileging the forms of judgment that parents can manipulate abrogates the purpose of public school gifted programs. The students should be looked at as individuals, apart from their families, which is what a holistic method such as teacher recommendations will do.",g3ql4qd
"The more the moratorium on student loans is extended, the harder it will be to stop it.","I have been calling it for a while in my friend group that the more it is extended, the more likely it will be political suicide if the extensions are stopped. I would not be surprised if this is part of some plan to eventually forgive student loans, but in a systematically and gradual manner, due to the polarization in the country (no one can ever agree on anything). This may be wishful thinking. I do have some loans, but they are too little to be a financial burden for the rest of my life. I have heard stories that kings would celebrate their coronation by forgiving all the debt the citizenry had. I don't think it would be a crazy idea that Biden is trying to do this slowly, especially when you consider the ideas of the younger Democrats. 

This might be the last extension.  But if it is extended again we need to start asking ourselves if this is just the new norm. With inflation and the general state of the economy (everything is getting more expensive), I believe the Democrats might even lose the election if the extensions stop due to a jaded base that is more to the left than the party establishment. I would personally forgive the loans, give Americans that did not go to college a stimulus check to cool everybody off, and call for a couple of days of celebration. 

The Republicans sound more populist than ever due to Trump. If my memory does not fail me, it was Trump that ordered this moratorium in the first place. Though the Republican establishment is still corporate, I believe many Republican voters are actually populists because of Trump. Any Republican running, if it is not Trump, could take advantage of this moratorium. 

But maybe I'm just talking shit. What do you think?",txtlvn,"It seems to be the opposite actually. 

Do you remember the CDO's of mortgages that caused the 2008 financial collapse? The banks and hedge funds have done the same thing with student loans. They packaged a bunch of loans together and sold them as investments. These investments are considered one of the ""safest"" and most reliable because student loan debt is nondischargeable in bankruptcy. So the loans have been used as collateral to rack up some of the highest leverage the markets have ever seen.

Forgiving the loans means those investments become worthless (or the government has to literally pay investors the full amount). And if the loans become worthless, then they can't be used as collateral for all the leverage in the market, so the stock market collapses as people deleverage. 

They keep delaying repayments starting, because mass defaults would also cause those investments to become worthless (like mortgages in 2008). So they are kicking the can down the road by not requiring payments.

The government literally can't forgive the debt without crashing the entire stock market, so it won't happen.",i3o9h58
Mandatory social service would help our society," Background: In my country it is mandatory for every able bodied man to either serve in the army or work for a social institution e.g. the Red Cross or senior homes, ect. 

There are certain situations where you are excluded / relieved either because of your bodily, mental &amp; emotional capabilities) 

I worked for the Red Cross as a paramedic but most of our job involved getting patients from their homes to their doctors for routine medical examination and back. Because of this I spent 60+ hours a week helping sick and old people and most importantly talking with them while driving. Needless to say that gives you a lot of insight into how these people live and cope with their lives which in my opinion is the first step to have empathy. 

In addition after the mandatory service some (about 30%) continued to work at the Red Cross voluntarily. (I don't know if that happens at other organisations as well or “just” at Red Cross and the like). After talking to those guys they all told me that they would have never thought about volunteering but did after coming in contact with it.

Thus not only did this service help the people we worked with but it also inspired others to continue even after the service. Additionally it gave me a greater awareness of other people and made me more empathic.

I have two big issues with the current implementation in my country:  
Firstly we were paid really bad (400€ a month) and as such “take the jobs” of others who had to be paid much better. (Minimum wage is much higher)  
Secondly we have a big bias towards the military as you have to spend 6 months serving in the army compared to 9 months working for social institutions.",jm8pk9,"Mandatory social service is a form of slavery because it rejects the right to choose who you want to be employed by.

Modern hip hop takes less talent to be successful than 10+ years ago,"I am trying hard not to be a grumpy old man (still just in my 30s). I want to respect the fact that my parents told me the same stuff when they heard my music blasting out of my bedroom. Their parents with them as well. 

Every generation seems to question new music.  But as a hip hop fan of the 90s, I can't understand how the stuff I've heard in recent years is at the same talent level (with some exceptions of course). Things like autotune is a good example that spans all genres. Mumble rap I learned about recently and had to confirm it was a real thing and not a joke...

Edit: word

Edit: if I were to change ""talent"" to ""musical talent"" would answers be the same? Seeing a lot of good points where marketing talent is huge. I'm just looking for pure musical talent comparisons.",ccoeuj,"First off, I'd like to say I am also a surviving member of 90s hip-hop, and grew up on 80s era hip-hop, and the music both eras sampled to no end. I once believed modern hip-hop, or to be more accurate, hip-hop based subgenres required less or more hyperbolically no musical talent. However I believe that isn't the case at all for a number of points I will go into.

1. Hip-hop as we knew it was a burgeoning genre that has now sprouted into many subgenres. This has caused the technical requirements for the many sounds held under the umbrella term Hip-Hop. As an example, Mumble Rap, the most maligned of modern iterations of modern Hip-Hop, has very specific musical requirements that differ vastlly from 90s Hip-Hop but greatly echo some of the earliest Hip-Hop. From a production stand point, instrumentals used in Mumble rap are largely composed of 808s synths that require meticulous sound design to perform well across different sound systems, mainly festival settings and clubs, alongside the latest mixing and mastering suites to stay competitive with other artists on the forefront of the genre. Due to the importance of the instrumental in this genre, the MCs voice in this genre is not there to play the narrator, poet, or sotryteller. It is another instrument. This can be seen very clearly in works by Young Thug, Travis Scott, and even Drake on occasion. The secondary role of the voice is call and response. The lyrics in these songs tend to either be purely instrumentation, or repetitive to the point of the listener being able to learn a chorus *during their first listen to the song.* This is crucial to creating the earworm effect these songs have, and has massive parallels to the DJ toasting that early Hip-Hop was based on. Pre-16 bar, prose style Hip-Hop, this was the primary function of the MC, to create hooks for the audience to repeat back, and is still a huge part of modern Hip-Hop. To make an analogy to Rock, is it harder to free play a Jazz Rock tune in key than it is to play a Metal solo under a sea of distortion and delay? Maybe. But they require different talents, and attract different listeners despite both being Rock music.
2. Music production in Hip-Hop has moved from sampled-based to composition-based. This change is nearly singlehandedly due to the proliferation of Digital Audio Workstations. Whether producing with samples or composing using MIDI and live instruments take more musical talent I won't touch, but today's Hip-Hop producers must not only be proficient beat makers but also often pianists, keyboard players, and more. To add, the roles of mixing engineer, mastering engineer, and recording engineer, are often all performed by the Producer in today's Hip-Hop. Often times by the rapper themselves as well. In the 90s and certainly 80s these roles were separate due to gear and training restraints.
3. My last point(I could go on forever but I don't want to write an essay lol), the proliferation of the tools necessary to create Hip-Hop, the democratization of platforms of distribution, and the ease of access to promotional tools have made it is much easier to release Hip-Hop nowadays. But it has made it much harder to be *successful* in the same way artists from the 90s were. For Hip-Hop artists to have lasting, impactful, and influential careers, in this day and age, they *must* have some musical talent. The flash in the pan, fly by night, industry plants that are essentially one-hit-wonders, may get by without as much musical talent, but no one considers Snow a successful rapper. I think keeping in mind we aren't in the golden age of Rock n Roll anymore is important, we are in the age of Emo, Pop Punk, Metal, and Grunge. Chuck Berry, Prince, Nirvana, Metallica, and Sum 41 are all successful rockstars, and so are Kool G Rap, Nas, Drake, Denzel Curry, and Smokepurpp, whether us old heads like it or not.",etowqy0
Politicians' political parties shouldn't appear on US voting ballots,"Limiting to the US because that's where I have voting experience.



It has been incredibly common recently for many to simply vote for the candidate with their political party of choice next to the name. This doesn't matter much for the presidential election, where each candidate's political party is clear from the sheer amount of exposure, but it makes a huge difference for the dozens of other government positions.

Now I don't disagree that knowing the party membership is important, since parties often vote as a bloc. However, when you vote, you vote for a specific candidate. Making an educated voting decision requires you to look up at least the most basic information about that candidate. The political party will almost certainly be the first piece of information that pops up. If political parties are important to voters, then this would encourage a bare minimum of research, and would discourage voters simply checking the box with an ""R"" or ""D"" next to it.

&gt; What about the few without internet access?

That does make things slightly more difficult, but driving to the local library or calling a loved one to ask shouldn't be impossible. I even recieved calls giving me information about candidates, I'm sure there are free services one may call to ask.

&gt; This disenfranchises voters such as the elderly and homeless

Again, this requires no technical knowledge or resources. Everything one may need is publicly available. In fact it may even pour more resources into assisting these voters, as giving them access to additional research resources makes them more likely to vote for one's party instead of not voting at all.

There is no such thing as apolitical.,"Every time I hear someone say ""I don't want politics in my X"" It seems to be coming from someone who is conservative to right leaning. The ones that want to keep politics out of the football stadiums are always the ones that want to express their politics the most. They just don't want any opposition to it. The ones that want to keep politics out of video games also cry the most when they can't live their reactionary ideals through these games any more. 
There is no such thing as apolitical. Everything is political. If someone takes no stands on an issue, this person reaffirms the status quo, which is again political. The right got it's name from the kings right. They wanted to keep kings in place and hold the status quo. The left always wanted to change the status quo. And there is nothing that neither affirms nor challenges the status quo. 
I have yet to see something apolitical. Change my view.",k8q01k,"&gt;The right got it's name from the kings right.

For example a graph that relates CO2 concentration to global tempreatures isn't political until one party makes denying facts a political issue.

I think having the Federal Reserve system (central banking in the US) is basically a good idea,"Over the years, I've heard many Libertarian or small-government types claim that having the Federal Reserve is a bad thing because it allows the government to enact monetary policy. The claim is that having an economy where central banking and monetary policy (per se) are impossible is superior because any problems with the economy will self-correct with sufficient time.

I disagree with this because I believe that monetary policy and central banking serve an important purpose in reducing the effect of economic depression, and central banking is also capable of slowing inflation by limiting access to money. There are other benefits of the Federal Reserve, but I'll focus on that as the main benefit, and I maintain that it has been effective (particularly after about 1945) in reducing the effects of economic depression.

Some qualifiers to my argument:

1. I am not saying that the Federal Reserve gets it right every time. I'm not interested in arguing whether or not any single decision was correct, or could have been made better, or action could have been taken faster. I'm arguing that as a governmental institution, the existence of the Federal Reserve has been on the whole positive for the national economy, rather than negative.
2. I am not saying that the members of the Federal Reserve are the ideal members. That is to say, I am not arguing that it would be impossible or even inadvisable to replace any member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (even the chair). What I am saying is, Libertarian calls to dismantle the Federal Reserve outright (with no replacement) are not a good idea.
3. I am not arguing about an abstract concept of liberty as an absolute good. That is to say, I have heard a few Libertarians say that it would be better for a free economy to be in depression than for a managed economy to be in a thriving state, simply because liberty is itself the goal of all existence. I am arguing that the existence of the Federal Reserve is good on a pragmatic, consequentialist basis and do not agree that a free economy of people starving in the street (in liberty) is inherently superior to all possibilities involving any measure of government. That is to say, I do not accept that ""because it's government"" or ""because it's not free"" is a reason in and of itself to reject central banking.
4. I do accept that for the first few decades of the Federal Reserve's existence, the institution was not terribly effective. But I maintain that in the 1950s and onward, the Federal Reserve has been relatively successful at its mission of guiding monetary policy and reducing the magnitude of economic depression in the US.

A few common arguments I have heard, and my response:

1. ""The existence of a central banking authority will inevitably lead to hyper-inflation because power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. It is therefore inevitable that the Federal Reserve will at some point plunge the economy into hyper-inflation, and not having a central bank would make this impossible."" - I admit that this is a possibility, but the reality is that the US has never experienced hyperinflation at the hands of the Federal Reserve. And honestly, I find it pretty unlikely that it's going to happen because no single person in the Federal Reserve can trigger an immediate drop to a 0% Fed Funds Rate for the rest of time (to choose a doomsday scenario). So, in the pragmatic, real-world, it seems better to have the Federal Reserve and the very, very slim possibility of a future monetary emergency, rather than the very real and documented problems with economic depression.
2. ""Having a central bank that can manipulate the amount of money in the economy will erode confidence in the US dollar. People will decide that the money is worthless, because the Federal Reserve can create and destroy currency at will, and people will stop using the US dollar. Therefore, the existence of the Federal Reserve is fundamentally incompatible with having a stable currency."" - Absolutely untrue, as far as I can tell. Similar to #1, the reality is that there's plenty of faith in the US dollar. 
3. ""The Federal Reserve system is inhibiting the US economy because businesses know that the Fed will increase the funds rate if the economy ""heats up"" too much, which will make borrowing difficult. Therefore, there is an incentive to NOT make as much money as possible in order to keep the Fed Funds rate low. If the Federal Reserve were to not exist, businesses would feel no pressure to artificially do worse at business, which would mean that they would enact all possible efficiencies and make far more profit than they currently do."" - I hear this one only rarely, though I find it the most bizarre. I see absolutely no evidence of this in actual business. Talking to business owners, I have literally never once heard anybody say, ""Well, we could sell more product, but you know... Got to watch that Fed Funds rate..."" So this feels like just absolute theoretical nonsense.
4. I know that there are arguments out there that the existence of central banking is somehow unconstitutional, but I don't understand how these arguments work because I've never been able to have one of these arguments fully explained. They seem to rely on legal definitions that simply aren't true, or don't match how law is actually practiced in the US.

I'm sure there are other arguments against the Federal Reserve, but I can't think of them off the top of my head. I think of myself as a relatively open-minded person. If there really are strong arguments against the existence (again, not the specific implementation) of central banking, then I'm open to hearing them.",dbgh8q,"You've left out a major common argument:  ""The Federal Reserve causes asset bubbles.""

Getting a Master’s Degree is Useless,"In my opinion continuing higher education past bachelor’s degree is not rational unless the studied field is medicine or STEM fields. A masters degree in any other field, other than previously mentioned ones, give no benefit in terms of earning potential. I believe that the return of investment (ROI) of continued education drops significantly after you have a bachelor’s degree, that’s why I believe that a master’s degree is not worth the money and time in this day and age.

We (America/Europe/The West) shouldn't be allowing trade with China.,"There are many reasons why China, as of today, is a f\*\*\*\*\* up place, and perhaps these reasons alone would be enough to ban trade with them. But that isn't my reasoning, there are a lot of f\*\*\*\*\* up countries in the world, even more than China.

My POV is more based on the historical context. I often compare China with this hypothetical:

Imagine nearing the end of WW2, the Russians push the German army from the east back into Germany, and the Allies push from the west. Except in this hypothetical, the Allies and Russia decide its not worth continuing into Germany, and do not force Nazi Germany to surrender Germany. Nazi Germany continue to rule Germany and other than world domination, they continue their crimes against humanity within their country.

Would we, all of a sudden, restart trade with Nazi Germany simply because the war is over? I really don't think so. I believe the moral pressure and political pressure would result in an absolute, no trade policy with Nazi Germany, just as we have with North Korea today.

So the only difference with China IMO, is that they did even more abhorrent crimes than the Nazis, yet we continued and continue to have an enormous economic relationship with them.

Full disclosure: I am without a doubt a pro free market believer, I believe that global trade makes the world more wealthy as whole. So this POV is not based on anything to do with economics, but simply a moral argument, and how the west ought to hold countries to account for their crimes.",j8oott,"Trade with China is mutually beneficial to both the US and China. By continuing to trade with China a door will stay open for China to see into the US and be exposed to a different culture and way of life and problem solving. If the relationship becomes strong enough, the countries can support each other in other ways (humanitarian, science, etc) which will increase the standard of living in both countries and reduce the likelihood of mass crimes being committed. 

Isolation leads to desperation, which makes it more likely more mass crimes will be committed.",g8f98ec
The Toobin zoom call incident is not sexual harassment and shouldn't be relevant to #metoo,"According to a few articles I have read about this, I don't think this constitutes sexual harassment. He was on a business zoom call, he meant to mute and turn off his camera, and then he had another call with someone he was sexually involved with, and then he ended up flashing his business call. To me, this sounds like he had no intention to flash his business call at all. Was it bad and inappropriate timing? Yes. Was it sexual harassment? No way. What someone does when taking a break is their own business. I think equating this to MeToo is a really big mistake. This sounds more like an honest mistake and now I think the most possibly embarrassing thing that can happen to you have happened to him. Not to mention he's being equated to a predator. I honestly feel quite bad for him.",jfhmuq,"I hadn’t even heard this, and gag me, who wants to see someone’s old guys pecker on a zoom call?

"Modern medicine is helping us now, but is ultimately ruining the gene pool.","Yes modern medicine is wonderful and has helped us live longer and healthier lives but we are also allowing those with “bad” genes to live(in cases where it is possible) which (if they have functioning reproductive organs) ultimately leads to them mating and passing those genes on.

Music Theory is Unimportant For 99% of Guitar Work,"Okay, so every time someone asks what they should do to learn guitar there's always a horde of people yelling ""You've got to learn Music Theory if you want to really play! Scales, notes, chord structures, etc!""

And that's case-in-point, frankly. No one ever says anything about music theory *beyond* ""Scales, notes, chord structures"" and the odd ""modes."" You could learn just about everything you ever need to know about those concepts in a ten minute youtube video. They might be helpful, but they're next to nothing as far as 'Music Theory' is concerned, to the extent that very little guitar players seem to have any concrete idea of Music Theory containing anything else.

If you take the time to learn counterpoint you'll be composing more complicated songs than 99% of other guitar players, and that's great, but that fact alone shows how *unimportant* music theory is for most of them.",eaafgo,"I think that you're confusing knowing music theory with applying music theory. A lot of music theory is easy to understand in principle, but difficult to apply in practice. Let's think about a very common problem that you have as a session player. You practiced a song in one key, but the singer is actually more comfortable singing it in a different key. The basic idea of transposing one key to another is very simple, you just take every chord and transpose it up or down by X amount. Any middling guitar player with basic knowledge of music theory could do it, given infinite time. But doing it on the fly? This is a whole other skill, and could require months and years of practice until it becomes natural. And it will take 20x the time to become natural if you try learning this skill *without* knowing music theory.",fapdn5q
 Such a large military presence by USA in Germany AND Italy is a waste of money.,"I can not pretend to be a USA military buff, but I do follow US and world politics and have an interest in this topic.

A recent post was explaining that the top four deployments outside USA, by USA military, is Japan  South Korea, Germany and Italy.  Technically, Afghanistan is ptobably a touch more than Italy, but.

I am a big fan of small Govt. But I understand USA needs to spend the most in the world on its military for a variety of legitimate reasons - including expensive labor laws, reliance by other countries, pork barrelling by keeping open bases in towns that there is absolitely no need to, but a senator has bullied  their way into relevance by stoppings its closure, etc. I get that technology has come a long way that the injury to death rate is about 25% of what it use to be. Military is expensive, and has some benefits. Fine. No dramas.

We all agree, I presume, that pork barrellling is not okay, and its stupid that Commanders feel the need to waste money with the primary aim to spend 100% of their budget so they don't get a smaller one next year - I get that people steal all the time, waste resources inappropriately, spend millions on junkets and entertainment, including strippers.

Where my knowledge is less good is with respect to why the USA still has large bases in both Italy and Germany. I get South Korea (DPRK) and Afghanistan (we sruffed them up and need to help rebuild / stabalise).

I can sort of see Japan --- very weak ""self-defense"" due to WW2, disputed territory with China, USA need to  be somewhere in Asia, friendliest country around that neck of the woods.

I can see wanting a Europe base --- I am a bit lost as to why UK cant be the sole large European base, but hey, thats fine. I am sure there is a good reason.

What I cant see is why, besides irrelevant historical reasons, the USA needs to spend billions in both Germany and Italy. Given that, I don't believe that the funding is appropriate, and at least one of those countries should have a significant troop withdrawal with the primary aim of doing so being to save money.

Is there any evidence that having such large bases in both Germany and Italy is necessary? Do any other countries do this, or just USA? Is this normal behaviour that just hasnt come to my attention before?",ck07oq,"Obligatory disclaimer that I will try to keep out Personal feelings about how I believe the system should be run. 

The current United States military/diplomatic doctrine is power projection.

The United States prides has since WW2 and still today prides itself on being able to fight on multiple fronts at the same time as well as being able to respond to almost any region in the world with overwhelming force.

In order to justify these bases, we can try to look at the world in Nodes :

Western Hemisphere - North and South America
Eurasia - Most of Europe and Russia
Africa - pretty self explanatory ;)
Middle East - Egypt and Israel over to Pakistan and India.
East Asian/Pacific - The rest of Asia and the Pacific.

Each of these nodes is established to counter enemies in the region, and are formed around the enemy and our bases. The significance of them can be broken down like this :

Western Hemisphere : bases in the United States and carribean can allow the United States to quickly intervene in any internal Latin American struggle, or to enforce the ol' Monroe doctrine.

Eurasia : This has the base in Germany, which gives us a close strategic tie to some of our most powerful and friendly allies, and also serves as a potential hard counter to one of our most ""scary"" rivals, Russia.

Africa : This would include the Italian base, as it being right in the Mediterranean allows it to provide us easy access to North Africa, which we tend to pay a lot more attention to. Not only that, the Mediterranean is an extremely important strategic resource. It allows access to shipping lanes that go through the Suez, and also allows us to intervene in regions that could be affected by major upheavels (think refugee crisis)

Middle East : We tend to have a prescense here inside of allied and occupied countries in an effort to ""stabilize"" the region.

East Asia/Pacific : Imho, I would place Japan as a more loyal and friendly ally than many of the European countries, and in a lot of culturally conservative ways we are more similar to them than to Europe. 

More importantly though, remember D Day in WW2? And how big of a deal that was? How much effort and how many people died just to cross the English channel and fight a bloody and battered Germany that had already lost in the East? Well imagine if we had to do that exact same thing, but across the Atlantic.

The same idea applies to Japan. In a way, they act as a wall and a jumping off point between us and the mainland continent of East Asia. If we needed to move agaisnt China or in the defense of North Korea, our odds become infinitely better by having Japan there as our ally.



All of these regions hold a specific, vital reason for having military bases for the current doctrine, and leaving these bases under defended or not defended at all would be, according to the doctrine ;), both I'll advised and irresponsible.",ewnn1oz
I should vote for Howie Hawkins (Green candidate) in the US presidential election,"Trump is repugnant, let's be clear. In his policies, however, Trump is much closer to Biden than Biden is to Bernie, Merkel, Jeremy Corbyn or any comparable European candidate. The democratic establishment has a interest in the success of someone who acts repugnant being the republican candidate. This makes it easy for them to put forward a candidate one level ""less"" corrupt than the republican candidate; it removes the incentive for them to try to appease the progressive wing. This is because they are constrained to vote for the dem candidate no matter who it is. The neoliberal wing can effectively ignore everyone outside of the establishment in this way.

""If you call yourself a true progressive you'll do everything you can to prevent Trump's election.""

A similar argument was being floated in 2000. Bush was unquestionably a bigger tragedy as a president than Trump because of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan which continue in some form to this day, as well as the expansion of the torture facilities at Guantanamo Bay. Multiple hundreds of thousands of people were killed as a direct result of wars began in the first term of Bush Jr, which for me takes precedent over the ugliness of Trumps' behavior, no matter how inflammatory it is. So the emerging pattern is every election, the moderate wing says ""(GOP candidate) is basically Satan, you're either with us or against us, most important election of our lifetime"" yadda yadda yadda, their candidate loses and they blame it on progressives rather than on their own shitty candidate, and the democratic party never has to evolve. 

The only possible way to get the dems to listen to us it to make them realize we don't ""owe them"" a vote, an attitude which illustrates the deeply-entrenched entitlement of the neoliberal wing. Change my view!",gntcrz,"The biggest issue with progressive ideas about sticking it to the establishment to teach them a lesson is that progressives aren't as big a group as they think they are. Progressives made zero headway in the 2018 midterms while the establishment made big strides. 2020 saw a repeat of 2016 where the progressive candidate solidly lost to the establishment one.

Progressives form about 30% of the Democratic voting bloc. A decent and influential percentage, but any possible leverage is constantly thrown away by progressives because they constantly do things like this. They vote third party. They take pathetic potshots at the rest of the party. They run spoiler candidates. And that makes progressives out to not be a part of the big Democratic party, but a tagalong that won't stop whining.

The Democrats are a big tent party. Someone has likely already told you and every other progressives eyeing the Green Party this. It is formed by coalitions of many groups with contradictory desires and positions, but that work together to pass legislation that has dragged this country out of recessions and towards progress. Not everything is as progressive as it could be, but actual progress is slow.

Progressives could be and, when looking at some of the representatives are starting to be, influential members of the Democratic Party. They didn't do this by threatening to take their votes to some worthless Green-colored trash can, they did it by working with the party like everyone else. Biden has taken on multiple policies that his progressive opponents were advocating, because they worked with him. Biden has organized several groups that combine progressives and more moderate members to develop further policy positions. This is more than any protest vote for some nobody will ever get you.",frbtdzc
"Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Georgia have certified that Biden won in those states, so now Trump should concede the election.","There is now no path for a Trump victory at this point. Trump has lost 30+ lawsuits. Even in those lawsuits, Rudy Giuliani under the threat of perjuring himself had to admit that those suits weren't about fraud. Trump has lost multiple recounts across multiple states at this point.

What is the Trump team waiting for at this point? This is a dangerous precedent where the President clings onto power as long as he can. His supporters have threatened the Republican Secretary of State of Georgia and his family for not certifying the results in his favor. Trump met with Republican officials from Michigan to try and secure a win in that state.

At this point, the best thing Trump can do is concede, and try to appease the insane factions within his base of support.

It seems crazy to me that we give our hearts to others because it's like giving that person a better chance at hurting us in the end. And there's always an end. it seems better to never have any relationships because of the potential heartache that comes with it all ending.",cqn3l6,"If you deny yourself the possibility to feel negative emotions, you also deny yourself the possibility to feel positive emotions. We are not really able to be selective about what emotions we feel, if we suppress a few, we begin to feel generally numb, because without one you can't have the other. 

A huge problem in relationships is when the butterflies fade and both have to realise that a relationship is not only made up of one fuzzy feeling and that the other person is not a conduit of this feeling but a fully realized human being with hopes, dreams, quirks and faults as well. A person leaving the relationship because they weren't ""feeling it"" can not accept or cope with this. Relationships are not vessels to make you feel better or less alone, they are first and foremost work. There is no ""falling out of love"", there is only a lack of willingness to work on it. Commiting to a relationship means accepting that your needs are not always a priority, that sometimes you have to keep up with someone else's antics, but conversely it means that you are able to gain someone who shares your life with you.

"The basic human right to die is ethical, scientific, rational, sacred and supported globally.","Japan has a culture of suicide as a way to redeem shame, wrong doing, wasted life or insufferable pain. It didnt cause mass suicides nor wreck their society. Belgium fully support and government funded the right to die and it DECREASED their suicide rates while giving those truly in perpetual mental and physical pain a dignified way out of torture. Most nordic countries support this basic human right, either by law or culture and they dont have high suicide rates. So why cant the right to die from a horrible life be adopted as a basic human right, to be as sacred as the right to live a decent life? It wont cause societal breakdown, it will probably decrease suicide rates since most of them will get all the help they need before deemed suitable for assisted suicide by professionals (just like Belgium) and those truly in terrible, incurable pain of the mind and/or body will get the release they deserve.   


I think its inhumane, selfish, cruel and utterly ridiculous that in this day and age, most developed countries are still against the basic human right to die, yet they have no rational, scientific or ethical reasons to justify their bias for life.   


Fact is, not every life is compatible with the genes and environment they are born into, some will suffer immensely and cannot be cured, even if its mental pain. These VICTIMS of life would LOVE to be cured and live a happy life, but they cant and medical science is not advanced enough to help. If we cant help them live, the very least we can do as a humane society is to help them leave with dignity, care, love and peace instead of stimatizing it, discriminating them and make them feel worse for being suicidal, as if they asked for it.

When people make sarcastic remarks, they use tone, they use body language, they gesticulate to indicate that they are being sarcastic. They raise their eyebrows, lean in, make 'bunny ears' quote signs, and perhaps change their voice to be more monotone or to sound more like someone else. 

In text, you get *absolutely none of that*. None. Zero. 

So therefore, we must rely on cues within a text to indicate whether this could be sarcastic. If those cues are subtle, are non-existent to an outsider who doesn't get the reference, or cannot be sure, your comment is Shroedinger's Comment now. It *might* be sarcastic, it might not be. 

Have you never seen an internet exchange where someone answers a sarcastic question in all seriousness or vice versa? How derailing that can be to genuine conversations, and how upsetting it can be to people who either wasted their time or who feel attacked for no reason. 

There can be many reasons for this - neurodivergency, a lack of familiarity with the culture of an internet place, reading something in a second or third language, or just a lack of familiarity with *you*, as a person. Are you naturally sarcastic so someone might lean more towards that? Or are you in a place that is generally snarky like many places on Reddit where wellmeaning replies are roasted out the whazoo? 

Putting an /s simply erases *all* of that ambiguity and allows all users to know exactly where they are and get the correct interpretation out of it. Two characters - saves so much time and effort and mental energy.",hzifxwu
The death penalty is *never* okay.,"If we look to the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: ""...all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" The very first right is Life. We have been given a life to live, and taking it away for an illegal act is unjustified. The government wrote that to oppose Britain. Why are we now doing it to ourselves? It's hypocritical that we put Life as the first and more important, but we're legally allowed to convict one of our fellow men, with the same rights as us, to death.",dpug4b,"The Deceleration of Independence is not a legal document.  It was a letter of protest to the British Government.  Nothing in the Deceleration of Independence is legally binding.  Furthermore, the American are guilty of many breaches of the DOI.  For example, 

&gt; He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

The Americans critisized the British for using foreing soldiers, but not opposed to having several French and German soldiers come to their aid, such Lafayette and von Steuben.  Also,

&gt; He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the *merciless Indian Savages*, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

Hopefully, the American government no longer holds firm to this ideal, even though they did for several decades at the cost of several thousands lives.

But, this question isn't about the DOI, it's about capital punishment.  The death penalty is okay in a certain condition, and that is when prison is not able to safely contain a violent offender.  Regardless of punishment or rehabilitation, prison is certainly a location that separates dangerous people from society.  People that are willing to kill are hazardous to regular people.  Normally, prison is a good enough option to protect society.  However, sometimes even the restrictions of prison do not eliminate violence.

Take Carl Panzram for example.  He was a serial killer and rapist that was in and out of prison.  While imprisoned, he even warned the warden, ""I'll kill the first man that bothers me.""  One day in prison, he killed a guard.  This murder was the act that finally got him executed.  There were some that tried to prevent his execution, but he replied to them saying, ""The only thanks you and your kind will ever get from me for your efforts on my behalf is that I wish you all had one neck and that I had my hands on it.""

In short, he was too dangerous to be left alive.  He is the type of person that demonstrated that prison was not a safe enough option for him.  There are ways to make sure that he doesn't kill anyone, such as solitary confinement, or keeping in chains all day long.  However, these preventative measures start to infringe of the restrictions against cruel punishment.  There is a rising push to ban solitary confinement because it is a cruel practice.  Additionally, these precautions may not always be effective.  It only takes one mistake by the prison for him to kill again.  Execution was the only way to ensure that he would no longer the deprive the life of others.

In the case of Carl Panzram, and others of equal violent tendencies, execution is perhaps the safest thing to do and the best way to preserve life.  In this case, it okay.",f602ply
Bernie Sanders isn't a socialist and he should stop saying he is one,"This applies to most of the new democratic socialists, by the way. I'm just focusing on Bernie Sanders.

The main tenets of his campaign and so-called ""democratic socialism"" include Medicare For All, free public college, raising the minimum wage, increasing taxes on the rich (and to some extent the middle class), rebuilding infrastructure, and ending regime-change wars (although the last one has to do with foreign policy).

The most pragmatic definition of socialism I've found is the elimination of capitalism and private industry in favor of a public system.

Medicare For All is an expansion of medicare, an already-existing public insurance option. The Medicare For All bill would lower prescription drug prices and provide universal coverage under a public insurance pool. This is an important distinction from the UK's NHS, in which all hospitals and doctors are owned, managed, and paid by the government. In Medicare For All, the government insurance option would fund private hospitals and private doctors. It wouldn't eliminate private insurance, although it would likely be reduced to a supplemental role. This doesn't fit the above definition of socialism.

Neither does free public college. America already has free public elementary, middle, and high school, and the measure would do nothing to eliminate private college. The minimum wage has been increased numerous times throughout history, as have taxes, especially on the rich. America already spends heavily in infrastructure and the Rebuild America act would just add to that while doing nothing to eliminate private insurance. None of these policies are pragmatically ""socialist.""

Using the label when it's not reflected in his policy substance is misleading at best and alienating at worst. The man himself might ideologically socialist, but using the term to describe his campaign while not promoting socialist policy is almost deceptive.

You can change my view by demonstrating that my definition of socialism is inadequate, showing how I'm misinterpreting the use of the word, finding a policy by Bernie Sanders that fits the above definition, or describing how my analysis of his policy is faulty. 

As it is, socialism doesn't describe the policy of Bernie Sanders and most other ""democratic socialists,"" so it's misleading to claim that they are socialist. CMV.",ccq46v,"&gt; The most pragmatic definition of socialism I've found is the elimination of capitalism and private industry in favor of a public system.

Are you sure that is the ""most pragmatic"" definition of socialism? Or is the best definition you could come up with that would fit your preconceived narrative/conclusions?

I just looked up a handful of definitions and none of them mentioned ""the elimination of capitalism.""

That would be like saying the definition of capitalism is ""the elimination of socialism"".

Your definition is an attempt to leave no grey area. Society has to choose between 100% socialism or 100% capitalism. That isn't the way reality works. Bernie is running on a platform of INCREASED socialist programs and policies. Not the elimination of capitalism. I'd gladly bet you any sum of money that Bernie has never stated he wants to eliminate capitalism. 

Not sure if your definition was in bad faith or just an oversight, but your definition is the groundwork of your argument. Since the definition is not accurate as it applies to Bernie and US Politics, your entire argument based on that definition is invalidated.",etok001
As a vegan the morally consistent thing for me to do would be to continue to be pro-life.,"I don't believe it is morally ethical to kill a sentient being that does not want to die. I've had some cognitive dissonance reconciling that with my participation in the mass slaughter of farm animals for a long time but I have recently decided to align my morals with my actions &amp; become vegan.

I have also been pro-life for many years. I'm open to the idea of an abortion at the early stages of pregnancy before a fetus has any form of sentience or in cases where the life of the mother is at risk but after that develops I think it would be morally inconsistent for me to defend someone's ability to end that sentient being.  

I don't believe there is any way to be vegan for moral reasons while also being pro-choice at a stage in pregnancy where the fetus has sentience. 

A human fetus with sentience has separate DNA from the mother. It is another living beings contained within the mother. If that separate living being has sentience and does not want to die it would be incompatible with vegan ethics to kill it.

Saying ACAB is going to cause more divide and is as bad as saying all cops are good,"ACAB if you didn't know is an acronym for All Cops Are Bastards. People have been saying this, or at least sending the same message, for a long time. It's understandable, as we all know that there is deeply rooted corruption violence and racism in the institutions that we are forced to trust to protect us, and in light of George Floyds murder outrage is at a peak. This has caused a lot more people to say things like ACAB, but I really don't think it is going to help the situation, and every time I try and make this point people *heavily* disagree but a lot of the arguments I've seen have been pretty hate-filled, just saying that all cops allow this to happen, which isn't true, or saying that I'm just a cop supporting racist pig. 

 First off I'd like to point out that the message sent by the blue lives matter movement has been in direct response and retaliation of trying to bring attention to racial discrimination in the justice system. And the message that they're trying to send now is coming across as ""Just trust the cops, a few bad apples don't spoil the bunch"", and that's just blatantly wrong. It implies all or almost all cops are good to at least some degree and I think we all know that that has been proven demonstrably false. But on the same token if we say that all cops are rotten to the core then all that will serve to do is discard any good cops' ability to really and truly serve and protect. Those cops are the ones who see the greatest effect of an ACAB mentality, as it means that even if they're doing their true best to be a good cop they're going to get shamed. 

Instead of focusing our hate on all cops in general, we should focus our hate on the crooked cops that we as a nation must do better to expose and focus our hate on the police departments, local state and federal criminal systems, and the politicians who have perpetuated this system. We can never stop the creation of racists and those who abuse power, so we could never solve this problem by simply getting rid of the cops that are already in service. It has to be the police departments held accountable for police officers actions, and the departments must be fixed in some way before this issue sees any real change.

There are good cops out there. Im sure we've all seen the post floating around of the large African-American cop talking to the protesters and they all start cheering for him as he speaks. He's probably a good cop, and Id hope that he isn't somehow caught in the crossfire between we the people and the filthy people and institutions responsible for these injustices.",gu2ky1,You must have missed all the things that Trump said,fsl9bwx

Racism can never be exterminated,"The true answer if someone is actually a racist is based off context. Context is a never ending rabbithole, and is something that can be fleshed out to an extent, but especially online you can only flesh out so much about an individual. Individual intellectial laziness lays ground for cancerous ideologies which the internet has exacerbated and laid new matrices of fertile ground. This has continually been muddled with the generations who have been raised in the internet era as the main source of ideological growth (this can include friends and family influenced by the internet). The internet has become all encompasing, which is scarcely understood. The amount of internet influence of mental formation is unknowable currently. Even those who have never experienced internet have been influenced by it in some fashion.

This has become such a nuanced issue, that people like jordan peterson have been able to stake an ideological claim as they are looking at the history of humanity to dictate thoughts, not newly pushed ideas as a result of the internet.

My main point i guess is that everybody is racist to an extent, and it takes true desire for learning to see beyond prejudices. You will never be able to radicate in totality those who proclaim racism. Humanity cannot be absolved of suffering, and it will seemingly always lead to a percentage of people who look to race as a reason why life presents the problems it does.

I wish there was an answer to eradicate racism, but until all people look the same, it will always be a scapegoat.",cfs463,"&gt;My main point I guess is that everyone is racist to an extent, and it takes true desire for learning to see beyond prejudice.

*Prejudice* is that I want to focus on because while I think we can't actively exterminate racism, I think it will passively fade away over a few hundred years.

There was some statistic I saw that said that in a few hundred years, most countries will be perfectly diverse. I.e. no minorities and no majorities. And I think that will kill off racism because when you grow up in a world like that, you have no reason to be racist.

We don't discriminate on hair colour or eye colour  because people are exposed throughout childhood to people of different hair and eye colour so they don't feel that one is better than the other because they don't feel like others are an outsider group. And without that ""us versus them"" thinking, they have no reason to have prejudice. So maybe at that point, racism might not even be a concept because at that point it would be as silly as us discriminating by eye colour today.

While I have absolutely no data, I would wager that those people who are most racists, are those who grew up in a single-race community.",euc4gsp
Donald Trump lying about being at ground zero should be considered a crime under the stolen valor act of 2013.,"I recently read that President Trump had said in his speech honoring 9/11 victims that he was at ground zero and sent over 100 workers to the site; however the acting supervisor of all ground zero efforts said that any contribution that large would have fallen under the direction of the joint chiefs and there is no record of it. There is also no record of Trump being there other than to give a German news crew an interview from a few blocks away. He is a public official claiming to have served in an official capacity along with police officers, firefighters and emts. It should be considered a crime.

**edit:** here is what i'll say after getting debunked in the first comment. i guess its not a crime under the stolen valor act and im a dummy for not googling it first. i still think it should be a crime to lie about something like that while being a servant of the people. ima take a sad nap now.

**edit 2:** so new spin. is the president a defacto member of the military b/c he is commander and chief? if so wouldn't this mean a member of the military service is claiming to serve somehwere they have not? i really don't know the answer. just the latest from the dialog. 

**edit 3:** so in my final edit here is what I have come to understand. 1. military vets have a special classification of valor defined under the law and does not apply in this situation, 2. people defending he was there citing the news footage from the German station clearly dont read posts 3. And as the commandor and chief he is still a civilian.  

**update: so one last update before I abandon this post.** i have learned a lot here. after this blew up i definitely regret not approaching this with a more informed view. i think there are a few views in here, but stolen valor by law, which has had various contests in court has a pre-existing framework. now i could have googled it and said ""it should be included"" -or- ""some lies by the president are considered crimes, this should be one"" the other view that arose was apparently there are lots of people who believe circumstantial evidence of the president saying he did things that no one can corroborate and pictures no person can verify their impetus, is enough information to say he is not lying, and that is a view all on its own. apparently by not accepting it i am some sort of mindless drone; which is generally not going to change my view he lied. the president lying may still be up for debate, but over the past 24 hours i have seen the evidence from both sides and am not convinced. those claiming it is because i am closed minded seem to be the most closed minded of all, but that is still just a view. 

**i have changed my view 3 times in this post and have taken the real insights to heart.** i think the real take away here is that many people jumped to the presidents defense in unique ways. saying all presidents lie, saying i have trump derangement syndrome, not reading any of the posts and just saying orange man bad and claiming i am closed minded because i won't accept that i have trump derangement syndrome, or accept circumstantial evidence, or i am just a fool who hates trump. i would like to say that if it were really proven he did what he said he did i would throw up the biggest delta in the history of deltas i am not here to perpetuate false truths. please read what the man said and what those working at ground zero have said before providing any further 'evidence'. maybe him lying is the view that should really be up for an educated fact filled debate. but certainly not mindless bots defending that man with the same ol' clips used to say what he has said cannot be be proven in snopes.

The plural noun ‘guys’ is gender neutral in most situations,"Like in several other languages, it is common to have a plural noun that is used when talking to a group of ambiguous gender. (For example the Chinese tāmen (plural form of he/him/she/her/it.)) however, English doesn’t have a specific word that fits this description in every way. They/them works when talking about a person/group but doesn’t work when you are talking directly to the group. The slang ya’ll fits this but what I want to argue is that the term guys also works.

Since English speakers outside of Some American states don’t use the phrase ya’ll when talking to a group of ambiguous gender, I think it is acceptable to use the term guys instead. However, this only applies if the gender of the group is either majority male or ambiguous. I think girls is the right phrase when talking to a majority female group or fully female group. The ambiguous situation is the one I think is open to debate. But my argument for it is that it is not disrespectful to simply call a group Guys when you talk to them because there is no simple alternative.",n82951,"In Chinese, the male, female, and object pronoun are all pronounced the same way, ""ta1"" as you said. They're all written differently though, 他，她，它 respectively. I think it was pretty smart of whoever came up with that to do so for speaking. But in writing, if you are saying they in regards to a group of multiple genders, you would use the male 他 to write 他们。This 他们 has the same problem as with the thinking of guys being a ""gender neutral"" pronoun because here the male version of the word is being applied as the gender neutral one. What this means is that male is the standard or default, and all under come after/under it. This kind of patriarchal norm is why many do not see guys as an appropriate gender neutral term.

It's ""acceptable"" because the use is so widespread, but just because women put up with it so long doesn't mean they have to continue to do so if they don't want to. You say y'all is not the norm across the US, so? Everyone understands that what y'all is, and if it's the abbreviated term that's got you feeling funny, just say **you all**.

Ultimately this is not as offensive as some other ways of referring to women (see: bitches, females, crazy, etc.) but it doesn't have to be in order to for you to take a woman seriously when she tells you she doesn't like you calling her that. Offensiveness an adjective, a spectrum. Things aren't just either offensive or not, and offensive things are not all offensive on the same level. Not everyone is offended by the same things, *and that's valid*. Calling women guys who take issue to it is a microaggression. And this is just one of many microaggressions women deal with everyday. So if a woman tells you that they are bothered by being referred to as guys, you don't argue with it, you say sorry, move on, and try to refrain from using it with her from now on. It's a simple matter of respect and courtesy, just as you would extend to someone if you mispronounced their name and they corrected you and gave you the correct pronunciation.",gxgdgdx
"Rebuilding NFL teams shouldn't draft a 1st round QB, no matter how good until they are not a bottom dweller","NFL teams draft QBs that are supposed to be great and they often are busts.  Sometimes they are (Manziel).  But often they are young QBs learning to play in the NFL on a bad team.  

Guys come in and try to learn how to play, and the team has no offensive line to protect him, if he is running for his life he can't make good plays.  If there are no offensive weapons he will have difficulty.  If the defense sucks he will be forced into throwing situations making defenses focus on the passing game. 

Players spend a year or two, suck, we call them busts and often it is just a bad team.  Look at Tannehill. He was sub par in Miami, goes to a good team with a good running game and is playing great.  

Remember these guys are learning and will make mistakes but can overcome those mistakes.  I am not saying they should be drafted by a team that is a playoff team.  But a team with a solid foundation.

If a team is drafting in the top 10, unless from a trade  or one bad season because of an injury (Colts after Manning injury), they shouldn't draft a QB.

Since 2001 every Super Bowl winning QB, not named Manning was drafted 10th or later",k4mz18,"The problem is that the learning curve for QBs tends to be much longer than for other positions.  Even a successful top pick QB will typically take at least a couple of seasons to reach the point where they are a consistent top QB in the league.  The other side of the coin is that the lifetime for players in the NFL is short, and the window for winning championships is even shorter.  Rookie contracts typically only last 4-5 seasons, and many draft picks don't even last that long.

If you build a solid team then draft a QB, all of the pieces that make the team solid might be on their way out of town by the time the QB is ready to compete at a championship level (whether that's from the players exiting the league or leaving through free agency).

FWIW, I agree with you that a team should make sure they don't have a catastrophe at offensive line before drafting a QB. There have been too many QBs that never got a fair shake because of that.  But I do think the QB has to come fairly early in the rebuilding process.",ge9r0e0

Nuclear Annihilation is possible,"As the war in Ukraine presses on, I have been engulfed in paralyzing anxiety regarding the whole situation. A few days ago, Putin stated that if anyone a part of NATO, most likely the US, gets involved in this, he will use “a force unlike anything in history”. According to history, experts, and literally everyone, that is a threat of nuclear war. When I heard that, I froze. Terrified. Hopeless. It’s bad enough that lives are being lost daily on both sides, but if the US makes a bad move, we all go up in nuclear flames. Every day, I’ve had that thought run through my mind. I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, I keep mistaking planes and helicopters as nuclear missiles, I can’t even focus on my school work. I can’t help but doom-scroll the news about what’s gonna happen next, hoping to find good news, then get hit with bad news. I also go on places like Reddit and Quora to hear people bring up arguments about why and how nukes won’t drop on us, making it seem like I’m not just trying to kid myself about there being no nuclear annihilation in the world’s future.

People have been giving a lot of reasons on why the odds of Russia launching nukes on us are low. Many say that the idea of Mutually Assured Destruction applies in this situation and Putin launching nukes. Putin would know better than to do that if he doesn’t want his country nukes back. The only argument against that is if he has gone off the deep end, he wouldn’t care about MAD and launch the nukes. Others say that since he can’t launch the nukes by himself, the generals would be more level-headed and completely refuse to launch them. But, there is the argument that either they will follow orders or get killed for defying Putin. There are other arguments like him getting assassinated, but I ruled that out because I don’t see that happening. Then, there are those who admit their lack of control of the situation, and advise to not worry about it because it’s beyond the control of the average person and continue enjoying life for as long as you can. I know this whole thing is out of my control, but the fear runs so deep in me that I can help but panic, researching to cope and hope for the best.

The chances of the US getting nuked during this is publicly declared unlikely, yet not 0%. However, as time goes on, seeing the situation escalate, and hearing whatever Putin says, I can’t help but feel like the unlikely have the slight chance to be likely. Everybody is hoping nuclear annihilation won’t happen, and it probably won’t. Maybe, I’m just extremely paranoid. But, my mind can’t drill in a positive, more optimistic perspective on this whole dark situation. I really hope it doesn’t come down to it, but if it does, I hope I’m in the blast radius so I get vaporized on the spot.

"If you believe that some people such as drug addicts, should not have kids, then you shouldn't call people who think poor people shouldn't have kids 'monsters'","I guess my view is, I don't see how it makes you a monster for saying that poor people, as in, for example, people in africa who walk miles just to find water, who are starving to voluntarily have kids. Even your average poor american. 

If your reasoning that drug addicts should not have kids is because you believe that the kids will be harmed, and as long as people's reasoning are the same, then why are they any different? many who say the poor shouldn't have kids believe a kid is better off not existing than existing. If you say 'existence' is better than non existence, than the same would apply to drug addicts. 

I guess I just can't see why for some reason when we add economics into it, everything becomes taboo.

Majority of people are ok saying pedophiles should not have kids. But somehow people believe that even the poor are entitled to have kids? Now, I believe that just because someone has a different standard does not mean that they are monsters. I might have a low standard, but someone having a higher standard are not monsters. 

Most of us will also agree that at a certain age, kids, as in teens should not be having kids. If I say well I don't think 16 year olds and under should be having kids, but you say that I don't think 20 and under should be having kids, does that make you a monster because your standard is 'more than mine'

There are people who have severe food allergies and who can only eat meat from animals that were killed the same day, but for the majority of people eating food that was frozen for months is no issue.

Finally, if income equality is the target, everyone being equally impoverished would be considered a good outcome. However, if a good baseline is the target, everyone being at least OK financially would be considered a good outcome.

It's not at all an unpopular opinion. Very few people today realistically think everyone should have exactly the same income no matter what. People recognize that harder work should be rewarded, and laziness should not.

*Most* people would even agree that everyone deserves a baseline quality of life.

People will disagree on the specifics (what counts as hard work or laziness, what counts as baseline quality of life, etc.) but I don't think anyone is really on the other side of your view, at all. Maybe some extremist outliers.",gpsksa8
It should be the standard in offices to allow for a 20 minute nap around noon,"A 20 Minute nap, after a few days of getting into the habit of it, is found to be the perfect amount of time to get the most energizing light sleep without transitioning into heavy sleep, causing drowsiness upon wake. We all know that productivity, energy, and morale dwindle in the afternoon, which, sure, wouldn't happen if everyone got the full 8 Hours of sleep at night, but let's be honest, who does that? 

There's really not much of a downside that I can see, because the increase in productivity more than makes up for the lost 20 minutes.

In fact, a 20 minute nap at noon actually decreases the amount of sleep needed at night to be healthy from 8 Hours to 6 Hours, giving more time at home as well.",g4szax,I can't change your mind because honestly I give up my lunch to do this,fo0ffov
The modern day tech and neo-financial sectors are heavily dependent upon positive economic factors and we’re likely headed for a 2000s style dot com bust.,"The easiest examples are probably Uber and social media “trading”. Uber has not, up until recently, even tried to run at a profit, instead taking advantage of extremely low interest rates and rounds of VC funding to make up for the losses it’s been taking. This means that anyone using an Uber or Lyft or Postmates style service has essentially been having their costs subsidized. Now the primary benefit of these companies has been the low cost to consumer and convenience. And once these companies switch to having to start being profitable, all that means is an increase in costs for the users and cuts to the returns to drivers. Reducing both the number of drivers and users and encouraging competitors/the return to the old taxi system. People like to point out that programmers in these companies are doing well in terms of real salaries, but those salaries are highly dependent upon the continued flow of VC to companies that would otherwise go bankrupt. Similarly, the modern investment guru phenomenon is based on listening to people who made their money in a time when it was genuinely harder to not be making money in the stock market or real estate. Using cheap  loans for leveraged buys, an impressive bull market, and quantitative easing making crypto take off. But now with stocks down and inflation up, people aren’t going to have the liquidity to invest in every crazy scheme they see on tiktok nor will they be able to borrow to do so. Neither of these industries have anything resembling the resiliency to survive a genuine bear market and when the music stops and we all get kicked out of the bar, a lot of people are going to suddenly faceplant into the tarmac.

Also, just gonna toss this out there, I feel that a lot of these services are essentially a form of subsidy for the urban upper middle and upper class, as opposed to being real solutions to any pressing issues and I look forward to money hopefully being diverted to more efficient sectors.",vfbp0x,"Even if these companies fail, we will see new companies or current companies that will have learned what works and what doesn’t.

"Quebec’s bill 21 is actually an extreme-left measure, not a rightist one","So for those who aren’t familiar with Canadian politics, the current government in the province of Quebec, the CAQ (Coalition Avenir Québec) is a government that is considered to be on the right (although the right in Canada is different from the right in the USA).

Anyways, a few months ago, this government introduced “bill 21” a law that essentially forbids government workers from wearing religious symbols. So no hidjab, no visible cross necklace, no turban, no kirpan, no kippa, etc. At first glance, this could seem like it’s more of a conservative measure because it impeaches on minorities’ freedom of expression. 

However, when you look at it from the angle that this law was presented as a way to maintain and enforce secularism, I’d tend to think that it’s actually more akin to see in a communist regime, because it’s not promoting individual liberties, which is what the right is supposed to do. This law takes away individual freedom of expression in favour of promoting mandatory secularism in an effort to make everyone “equal”.  It also gives the government a huge influence on people’s lives. Therefore, I believe it is a leftist measure, just not the kind of left that activists like to see.",jnze7n,"Its neither left nor right, it’s authoritarian as opposed to libertarian.

Remote learning is bad in the long run.,"Here's a super true unpopular opinion, so I expect this to either get deleted or downvoted to oblivion.

Yes Trump is obviously trying to reopen schools for political gain he doesn't seem to care too much about the children of this country. But all of the people out there who are totally against the idea of reopening are mostly spoiled rich kids who've never struggled a day in their lives.

What about the kids who have no internet access? What about kids with disabilities. Kids who live in abusive homes and use school as an escape. You'll be surprised when studies come to show the correlation of abuse and this lockdown... Kids who've had to get a job this summer in order to provide for their family and will lose that job when forced to find a way to get their schooling done. What about the kids who's parents have to work all day without any supervision? Kids who only meals of the day come from school? What about the kids who struggle with mental illness? As someone who struggles with depression myself I can tell you this lockdown has taken a toll on my health.

Look I understand people's concern, but it seems like most people arguing against Trump don't even think about anyone else but themselves not everyone has wifi, let alone running water.

I get it we must make an effort to ensure in person learning is as safe as possible. But at the end of the day we have to open up school eventually. No one knows when this pandemic will end. But soon we will have to make sacrifices to ensure the future of our country is protected.",ho8kbt,"The biggest counterargument here is that you're valuing a small group of children over the safety of them all. I agree that we should do everything possible to help impoverished, abused, or mentally ill children. But the other option is, for now, far worse. 

*Most* american children have access to computers, internet, and supplies at home to make remote learning feasible. The FCC claims that only 6% of households in the US lack regular internet access \[[Source](https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/reports/broadband-progress-reports/eighth-broadband-progress-report)\] - it's rather safe to assume that only a portion of these households contain school-age children. So less than 6% of children have this issue at all, and a portion of *those* will be getting loaner resources provided by their school districts. This will only impact a very small portion of children. 

If we send all the children back to school right now, thousands of them will die. And possibly millions of parents, teachers, and caregivers will die with them. We would be opening up one of the best possible transmission vectors when the US is already getting ravaged by the virus. I acknowledge that abusive home lives will only get worse as time passes in lockdown, but frankly, i'd rather have an abused and hurt child on my conscience than a dead one. 

I think a better solution to most of these issues is to enact proper aid programs for impoverished schoolchildren and their families. If your *only* meal is from school, then your family needed major assistance before all this happened - and we should focus on making sure that those children can get food at home, rather than risking all those lives so they can have terrible-quality school food. 

Sending children back to school now isn't protecting the future of anything. It's dooming the youth to childhood trauma at the loss of their friends, potentially lifelong medical issues, or death.",fxg8pp5
"The best way to cook a marshmallow over a campfire is slowly, to golden-brown","I've had friends over the years who claim the best way to make a marshmallow when camping is to let it catch fire, burn a few seconds, then blow it out. Those friends are wrong.


When you're sitting at a campfire and want to toast a marshmallow, the best way to go is slowly. Watch it carefully and stop once the mallow is yellow-brown all over-- and don't let it catch fire! A lightly toasted marshmallow is evenly warm, perfectly carmelized, and great for any use. 


A charred marshmallow presents too many problems-- the blackened outside slips off (what do you do with that part? Eat it? It's basically just charcoal), the inside is too sticky (it's been essentially melted at that point and is too unwieldy), and you're likely to have dangerously high temperature variation (a recipe for a burnt mouth).",g4wnws,"I disagree. The best way to cook a marshmallow is neither slowly until golden brown, nor aflame. It is quickly, to a slight char, with a stronger caramelization than the light golden brown.

What is the point of roasting a marshmallow? To eat it whilst warm, but to also impart flavour when you caramelize the sugar. A light golden brown is not going to give you the same type of flavour enhancement, especially when you use it for smores. Sure; it'll be warm, but you're missing out on the flavour.",fo01az8

If you are an hourly worker you owe the company you work for the 40 hours they pay you and nothing more.,"There's an idea that's pervasive in employment that you and your coworkers are a family and that you should be passionate about working there which can mean eating lunch at your desk and working through lunch so that hopefully they see you as good enough to let you stay, as opposed to getting some sort of promotion or raise, or that you stay after hours for free. I see all of this as way for employers to subtly take advantage of their employees while owing them nothing in return. Simultaneously there's this relatively new understanding that employees are all on their own, that they cannot expect their employers to be looking out for them or their interests. Again, employers wanting you thinking about what's best for the company, but it's a one way street as they will not be looking out for you.

I see this sort of behavior from the employer as very bad for the employee and that people in this situation should start collectively adopting the mindset that they owe their company the hours that they pay them, and nothing more. This is especially true if you are working extra so that maybe your employer will ""let you stay"" as if it's some sort of privilege to be working at their company as opposed to some sort of hope that they will be promoted. You should not feel obligated to give them any extra work beyond what they are paying you in that scenario.",bxgrsf,"Do you live in the US (or probably the EU)?

"Sugar substitutes are good alternatives for people that cannot consume sugar, they offer similar taste, and yet are almost calorie free, so its a win win for everybody.","So I have heard people talking about substitutes, because at first it was sugar is now bad, and it went from there to the sugar-substitutes are bad. Why don't you just say anything sweet is just bad, and put an end to it?   


I think that sugar substitutes are a decent alternative to those of us who cannot eat sugar, may be due to diabetes, or maybe due to our lifestyles, or simply to reduce our calorific intake. Maybe the older substitutes like saccharin/aspartame might not be so good, but Erythritol and other newer ones have the same taste like sugar and have 0 calories since we cannot digest them fully.   


For example: If someone like me, is addicted to drinking coke, I can substitute it with the diet coke/coke zero and enjoy my favorite drink without any hesitation.

University education should be primarily online.,"For context, I've never attended physical university classes but I've spent a lot of time on campuses meeting friends or just hanging out. I go to an Open University which means my classes are held remotely and asynchronous, no boring lectures at 8 AM, and I can work at my own pace and wherever I like.  


Given the insane cost of university education and the fact that after class students go home to work on their computers anyway I think University level education should be online for 95% of people. *(I am not arguing for high school or any lower levels as I think the benefits of physical education still outweigh remote learning).*  


It's better and cheaper for students, it's more convenient for professors, and if you are in public universities it is a net positive for governments. The Open University in the UK social and economic impact was pegged at **£2.77b** [(src)](https://www.open.ac.uk/business/london-economics#:~:text=New%20figures%20place%20the%20total,direct%2C%20indirect%20and%20induced%20impacts) that's really good for a university where the majority of students will never step foot in a classroom.  


For socialization, I think clubs, parties, hacker/makerspaces, meetups, and conventions, or even workplaces are good options for university students to keep meeting people without the need for physical campuses.

CMV.",jtzqmw,"So there seems to be couple of problems here. Most of your examples of the breach of free speech would be equally punished in US.

&gt;In France, 12 protesters were fined for supporting the boycott of Israel.

In the recent events people were beaten, gassed, killed and of course charged by police officers because of peaceful demonstrations. Countries often use either security or hate-speech as a reason to deter people from protesting.

&gt;In Denmark, a politician was convicted for burning Korans.

Typical hate-speech. There isn't even an excuse, a famous racist going to Muslim parts of cities being caught on tape literally inciting violence and ""covering the Korans in the semen of Christian men"". Yeah ...

&gt;A German politician was criminally charged for calling migrants “scum.”

Incorrect, he was charged because of series of facebook post where he in lengthy posts called them cattle, trash, sub-human, etc... aaaand basically ticked every single box in order for this to be classified as hate speech. It's also important to mention that there was an actual terrorist organization arrested that planned to bomb refugee centers with illegal fireworks for some reason and they cited him as the reason for the bombing.

&gt;In England, a Baptist minister was jailed overnight for preaching against homosexuality

This is an interesting one there is finally some nuance and not just racist commiting hate speech. So apparently the preacher as religious people tend to do in rural religious communities spent couple of hours explaining the wrongness of homosexuality to vulnerable young gay teen. The teen called police and acused the preacher for threatening and abusive behavior toward sexual orientation. The preacher spent night in jail and then he was cleared of all charges.

Personally I find it disgusting that religious authorities still are able to preach about how homosexuality is wrong in one on one session with kids. But the preacher was cleared of all charges so the system obviously worked on that instance. Altho I find it more comforting than threatening that preaching wrongness of homosexuality slowly becomes identical to hate speech.

&gt; and a man was investigated for telling a Nelson Mandela joke.

Yeah this one is genuenly disturbing. It's the reason of US style patriot act in action where law enforcement agencies pick off certain keywords and put them on ""terrorism watch"" list and in this case it got them 8 hour interview with police. And this Mandela joke is more ridiculous result of this style of policing. But the man was not actually charged, but the fact that it went that far is concerning.

Now the only flat out wrong example in your comment is the first one.

&gt;In Austria, a woman was convicted for blasphemy

Neil deGrasse Tyson is way overrated and should not have nearly the social power that he has,"So, I haven't thought about NDT for a long time, but recently a lot of his videos have popped up on my YouTube recommendations and I watched parts of two of his appearances on The Joe Rogan Experience and, I gotta say, he just sounds arrogant while he says stuff far too matter-of-factly as though he actually was saying some deep truths and not just overly confident stuff.

Taking the [most recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NEmgA2FlO8) I've seen of him, where he talks about targeted ads, and how he is against them because *they take away his freedom to not find what he wants*. He says it as though it's some really powerful deep truth about how targeted ads change how we interact with the world, and in the end, to me, it just sounded so dumb even though I agree with it *to an extent* (that being specifically me often getting angry at my difficulty to find new different stuff to watch on YouTube). But he presents as though it truly is this deep thing that is *taking away your freedom* it's just ridiculous.

Then there is the piece of the interview about [Tesla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRXyCwyicLA), where lots of people in the comments have pointed out that he's making a strawman argument of Tesla's proposal.

I could point out to other videos I've seen of him but in the end the idea just repeats itself: he gives a far too simplistic view on a subject, picks one scientific aspect of it that might only be tangentially related, and then arrogantly explains it as though he is a mastermind educating the world about the level you can achieve with a massive intellect like his own. In these specific scenarios this becomes really daunting as he keeps interrupting Joe Rogan to double down on things that are often times a tangential argument on the thing actually being discussed.

It also amazes me how a ""scientifically minded man"" such as himself will often comment on things that he has no basis to speak of, or just things that he kinda remembers but not really. An example of the former can be found when he talks about flying cars on the Joe Rogan podcast (a part of it that is, in itself, hard to watch as a whole because he keeps saying things as though they're mind boggling and saying absolutely idiotic things such as that a subway is already a flying car), when he is talking about how noisy it would be, because it would have to be a helicopter, and then they show him a prototype of a vehicle that talks about being less noisy than an average highway, and he goes on a tangent about the aerodynamic noises that happen in high speeds, and how airplanes happened to be really noisy, only to end up saying that they stopped being that noisy because the main problem was engine noise--basically he seems to go out on a tangent to make it seem like he's doubling down on his own view, but then he makes the tangent long enough that by the end he can give a completely different fact so it seems like he was right the entire way. The latter happens on the piece about targeted ads, where he talks about the case of the pregnant teenage girl. It is a true story that is very shared, but not in the way he described. It wasn't a girl that was Googling about pregnancy stuff only to receive by mail a set of coupons for pregnancy stuff (if you stop to think about it for two seconds you'll notice how weird that sounds). [What really happened](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/) was that Target figured out she was pregnant from her shopping habits--in store--and  sent her the coupons, that were discovered by her father. Does the story still make sense to his point? Kinda, but also not really because his problem wasn't the privacy aspect of it. But the way he tells it makes it seem even more dystopian than it truly was.

I could also talk about his twitter feed, but r/imverysmart features him every now and again with the ridiculous things he says. It is also somewhat known that in the scientific community he isn't regarded as a great scientist, but rather a good ambassador for science, with some people even taking exception to that, as he tends to be simplistic in his portrayal of science many times.

I should also mention that I will not draw any parallels between Tyson, Nye, or Sagan, because of the three I only really know Tyson, not having grown up in the US or with either of the other two. I will also say that Tyson does have his merits: his Cosmos series was entertaining to watch, though I don't know how it stacks up to Sagan's original.

But in the end I do think that he was given far too much public space and I feel like that has inflated his ego to the point where he seems to have become so arrogant that he'll take his personal views and philosophies (ironic, I know), along with half-baked ideas about stuff and superficial understanding/debunking of other's ideas, and blown them up to seem like deep truths about science and the universe.

Mental health regulation in the gun control debate is irrelevant and would be impossible to implement,"Whenever I see people talk about gun control in the United States, there's always people who take the mental health treatment/ testing route. It's either A) We should have better mental health treatments in general to lower the amount of mentally ill people (who could possibly get a gun and misuse it) or, B) We should require more tests/reports/ investigation surrounding an individual's mental health when they go to get a gun license and inevitably a gun. However, I find this argument to be idealistic and like it comes fron people who don't understand enough about mental illness.

 First of all, better treatment for mental health (better school counselors, cheap/free therapy and medication, raising awareness, etc.) will not eradicate mental illness. Especially not for people who are so ill to the point that they want to shoot up a school. These kind of facilities require the mentally ill individual (or their family who KNOWS that they are mentally ill) to go get help. Many people do not want help, and many people do not trust psychologists and counselors. It's a harsh reality, but many mentally ill people will actively avoid seeking treatment. Someone with a lot of hatred or betrayal in their head is even less likely to seek treatment. A lot of people with mental illnesses don't even think of themselves as being mentally ill. 

As for the second approach, it neglects to address that many times, you cannot get an accurate test from someone that does not want it. Sure, psychology has come a long way— there are many psychologists who can figure out what's wrong with a person even if they lie their asses off. But not all psychologists are that good at their jobs, and not all people find lying hard. Trust me, from personal experience, mental health patients trick their doctors a lot more than people think. The other part of this approach is looking more deeply at medical records as well as crime/school incidents. That would be effective, I agree, but it also doesn't address that sometimes this is the first extreme thing someone will do due to mental health issues, and that if someone never looked for help/did something extreme we will have no records on their mental health. On top of that, there are plenty of perfectly sane individuals who would be denied their rights (not my view, but for the sake of my argument, sane individuals have the right to bare arms) in this scenario because they did something while intoxicated once 5 years ago, or struggled with depression when they were a teenager.

It would also be incredibly hard to implement this all nation wide— in poor towns and rich towns, rural villages and large cities— there's now way we could accurately assess people's mental health statis every single time they get a gun license or a new gun.

These are all defined by physical characteristics that can’t be changed without surgery and/or hormone injections. In the case where someone wants to seriously transition, they undergo a sex change surgery and take hormone injections. They do everything possible to transition *biologically.* 

One of my problems is that changing one’s gender identity is purely a mental construct, whereas one’s physical characteristics (including the distribution of neurotransmitters and hormones, which significantly effect behavior) are measurable and visible. Essentially, if someone only transitions socially, they are relying on themselves and everyone around them to buy into an ill-defined mental construct that only serves to benefit ONE person, the socially-transitioning. 

The second problem is that the very notion of “gender identity” attempts to codify someone’s identity. A person’s identity is malleable and completely incomprehensible to a different person. Yes people might have identity traits in common, but no two people express those traits the same way. To me it feels completely futile to apply definitive labels to someone’s identity, when the very concept of an identity is basically impossible to define in the first place.

Edit: So today I learned that the term “gender” makes even less sense than I originally thought. I’ve had to think reading the comments, and I’ve definitely learned a lot. I didn’t change my mind, but my opinion is certainly better informed now. If biological sex and gender identity are not the same, then *internal* suffering happens when a person has the two unaligned. Gender Dysphoria is a *mental illness* that is in the DSM-5. No one should be shamed or discriminated against for having Gender Dysphoria, but it’s definitely *not normal* and *should not be normalized.* This leads me to believe that even if the two are technically separate, they are *supposed* to be the same and can in most be cases treated as such.",juqmdx,"So one thing that helped move my perspective is that I assumed that gender dysphoria occurs when the gender doesn't match the sex as a result of the mind not matching the body rather than the body not matching the mind. I.e. it was the brain/mind that was defective rather than the body.

So it made me imagine a person born as a quadriplegic who always wanted to be a rock climber. It isn't their mind failing them, it is there body.

It gets really philosophical really fast imo because some people might not separate body from mind whereas others will ponder what makes a person a person. Or even what is normal vs abnormal because that is based on arbitrary lines drawn such as being 3+standard deviations away from the mean of x.",gcgopwq
The Oscar’s staged the Will Smith slap to increase ratings,"Oscar ratings were at an all time low and they needed something to get the people talking about it. Everywhere on social media is talking about the Oscar’s now. They took a page out of the bachelorette and created some drama to get the people talking about it. Everyone involved in it benefited from the slap. Also, the Oscar’s didn’t do anything to reprimand Will for his slap, and he even won an award 20 minutes later. Why wouldn’t they cut away to a commercial as soon as the slap happened? To me it appears to be obvious that this was just a set up to help with the all time low ratings, but I would like to hear some of your guys input. Am I crazy to think this?",tq2tyw,"I disagree, I had a similöar discussion with a friend and the conclusion was if they did it to create hype about the Oscars they would added a racial angle, make a White person slap a black person.",i2lcwc1
I think I am becoming an anti-intellectual,"""Anti-intellectualism"" is a popular buzzword, usually accompanied by complaints about it being one of the biggest problems in America that isn't as widespread in other countries.

This has been a complaint for a long time, as the famous Isaac Asimov quote suggetsed in 1980:

&gt; There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that ""my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.""

However, this complaint started several years earlier with the publication of Richard Hofstadter's *Anti-Intellectualism in American Life* (1970).

&gt; Anti-intellectualism … first got its strong grip on our ways of thinking because it was fostered by an **evangelical religion** that also purveyed many humane and **democratic sentiments**. It made its way into our politics because it became associated with our **passion for equality**. It has become formidable in our education partly because our educational beliefs are **evangelically egalitarian**. Hence, as far as possible, our anti-intellectualism must be excised from the benevolent impulses upon which it lives by constant and delicate acts of intellectual surgery which spare these impulses themselves.

It seems that the concern is even older than that, though; the earliest reference I can find is Adlai Stevenson I's in his 1954 *A Call to Greatness*:

&gt;Unreason and anti-intellectualism abominate thought. Thinking implies disagreement; and disagreement implies **nonconformity**; and nonconformity implies **heresy**; and heresy implies disloyalty — so, obviously, thinking must be stopped. But shouting is not a substitute for thinking and reason is not the subversion but the salvation of freedom.

Weirdly, it seems like Hofstadter and Stevenson have opposite complaints. According to Hofstadter, anti-intellectualism results from the fact that a blind trust in intellectuals smarts of conformity and illiberalism, the creation of a crooked elite. Stevenson says the exact opposite, that intellectuals are hated because they refuse to conform.

So it seems like ""anti-intellectual"" is more like ""fascist,"" a general term that can be used in any direction for almost any reason.

I'm writing this because I think I'm developing a general disdain for ""academia"" or something like that, and I'm trying to figure out why and whether I can be ""cured"" (since anti-intellectualism seems to be uniformly decried . . . except at the ballot box, it seems).

The first step I think is to define anti-intellectualism. Sometimes I see it basically used as a more polite term for ""stupidity,"" like for people who genuinely think the Earth is flat or that vaccines cause autism or that toothpaste is a scam. I certainly don't believe these things; I also don't believe outlandish conspiracy theories or that climate change is not man-made.

I think there could be a more nuanced case for anti-intellectualism, though. Because ""intellectualism"" is really two things:

1. special expertise beyond a layperson's ability to understand, demanding him to just give his blind faith

2. a certain type of thinking characteristic of the ""intellectual mind""

I'll start with the first case.

Experts are not that good, and certain fields in particular are notorious in this regard. It has been shown numerous times that financial analysts cannot accurately beat a market index when picking stocks, that political experts cannot predict events (Nate Silver's excellent book *The Signal and the Noise* has many more examples like these), that legal experts cannot accurately predict the outcomes of Supreme Court cases, that parole officers cannot accurately predict recidivism rates, that college admissions cannot accurately predict which students will succeed (there's a great book on a few examples like this called *Talent is Overrated* by Geoff Colvin).

It gets more concerning when you consider that more ""scientific"" fields suffer a similar problem. There is mixed evidence (I don't see enough to be confident either way) that dentists are only moderately accurate in identifying cavities, and there is strong evidence that psychologists cannot accurately predict human behavior.

Going further into science, there is the more general case of the Replication Crisis, which is by now famous enough to earn capital letters and [it's own wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis), but experts in statistics (full disclosure: I am a data scientist by training) have raised concerned about replication for decades. The publish-or-perish lifestyle of a researcher encourages both active unethical practices (rounding p-values) and more subtle psychological practices (like deciding which data points were flukes). Even discounting that, the nature of randomness and the nature of publication can result in a majority of published findings being incorrect.

(As an aside, newspaper bullshit doesn't help at all. I can't even remember how many times in the last month alone I've seen a headline of ""study shows X,"" looked up the study, gotten hit with a paywall, while the abstract showed a much more moderate or even non-conclusion.)

Nutrition I think is one of the worst offenders here. Nutrition is an incredibly difficult thing to study, even though it can be done semi-experimentally (which makes it more obvious how little faith should be had in economics or similar studies). Nutrition experts who created the food pyramid, which is completely inaccurate, contributed to the obesity epidemic. There simply isn't enough data to draw solid conclusions, but each new large study gives the impression that the whole field has swing a different way.

It's actually a nutritional study that inspired me to write this. Yesterday, I saw an article about a nutritional study published in the *Annals of Internal Medicine* saying that red meat might have health benefits and suggesting that current levels of intake could be perfectly fine. The Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health immediately decided to publish a statement opposing this, and one of its arguments stuck out:

&gt; The publication of these studies and the meat guidelines in a major medical journal is unfortunate because following the new guidelines may potentially harm individuals’ health, public health, and planetary health. It may also harm the credibility of nutrition science and erode public trust in scientific research.

That's the whole fucking point. It's awful for supposed scientists to oppose the publication of studies in order to ""show a united front,"" as though they're two parents trying to avoid disagreeing in front of their kid.

Final point before going to (2): Before about a hundred years ago, doctors were bad and you were better off avoiding them. They would in most cases leave you worse off. Some statistics are straightforward to come by on this; for example, women who gave birth with a doctor actually died more frequently.

It's not implausible that there are fields today (nutrition?) that are currently in the pre-100 years ago doctor stage. Remember that back then, doctors still went to school for a long time and attended conferences and were respected, and everyone wanted to go to one. But they were actively negative influences until the germ theory of disease and penicillin.

I guess this is a smooth enough way to transition to point (2), though I could go on for a bit longer about fields where experts really aren't.

""Intellectualism"" isn't just the quality of having intelligence and expertise; it's an attitude characteristic of a certain type of person. The philosopher Robert Nozick wrote a great piece related to this topic in 1998 called [""Why do Intellectuals Oppose Capitalism?""](https://www.libertarianism.org/publications/essays/why-do-intellectuals-oppose-capitalism). Quotes:

&gt; It is surprising that intellectuals oppose capitalism so. Other groups of comparable socio-economic status do not show the same degree of opposition in the same proportions. Statistically, then, intellectuals are an anomaly.

&gt; Not all intellectuals are on the “left.” Like other groups, their opinions are spread along a curve. But in their case, the curve is shifted and skewed to the political left.

&gt; By intellectuals, I do not mean all people of intelligence or of a certain level of education, but those who, in their vocation, deal with ideas as expressed in words, shaping the word flow others receive. These wordsmiths include poets, novelists, literary critics, newspaper and magazine journalists, and many professors. It does not include those who primarily produce and transmit quantitatively or mathematically formulated information (the numbersmiths) or those working in visual media, painters, sculptors, cameramen. Unlike the wordsmiths, people in these occupations do not disproportionately oppose capitalism. The wordsmiths are concentrated in certain occupational sites: academia, the media, government bureaucracy.

&gt; Wordsmith intellectuals fare well in capitalist society; there they have great freedom to formulate, encounter, and propagate new ideas, to read and discuss them. Their occupational skills are in demand, their income much above average. Why then do they disproportionately oppose capitalism? Indeed, some data suggest that the more prosperous and successful the intellectual, the more likely he is to oppose capitalism. This opposition to capitalism is mainly “from the left” but not solely so. Yeats, Eliot, and Pound opposed market society from the right.

I like this demarcation between ""wordsmiths"" and ""numbersmiths,"" though I prefer the distinction to be between ""those who deal in ideas"" and ""those who deal in application and practice.""

&gt; Intellectuals now expect to be the most highly valued people in a society, those with the most prestige and power, those with the greatest rewards. Intellectuals feel entitled to this. But, by and large, a capitalist society does not honor its intellectuals. Ludwig von Mises explains the special resentment of intellectuals, in contrast to workers, by saying they mix socially with successful capitalists and so have them as a salient comparison group and are humiliated by their lesser status. However, even those intellectuals who do not mix socially are similarly resentful, while merely mixing is not enough—the sports and dancing instructors who cater to the rich and have affairs with them are not noticeably anti-capitalist.

So he claims that intellectuals feel as though their role is of superior importance to those successful workers or businessman whose products are much more popular and profitable, and that this isn't just because of their proximity to those successful people.

&gt; Intellectuals feel they are the most valuable people, the ones with the highest merit, and that society should reward people in accordance with their value and merit. But a capitalist society does not satisfy the principle of distribution “to each according to his merit or value.” Apart from the gifts, inheritances, and gambling winnings that occur in a free society, the market distributes to those who satisfy the perceived market-expressed demands of others, and how much it so distributes depends on how much is demanded and how great the alternative supply is.

&gt; From the beginnings of recorded thought, intellectuals have told us their activity is most valuable. Plato valued the rational faculty above courage and the appetites and deemed that philosophers should rule; Aristotle held that intellectual contemplation was the highest activity. It is not surprising that surviving texts record this high evaluation of intellectual activity. The people who formulated evaluations, who wrote them down with reasons to back them up, were intellectuals, after all. They were praising themselves. Those who valued other things more than thinking things through with words, whether hunting or power or uninterrupted sensual pleasure, did not bother to leave enduring written records. Only the intellectual worked out a theory of who was best.

&gt; What factor produced feelings of superior value on the part of intellectuals? I want to focus on one institution in particular: schools. As book knowledge became increasingly important, schooling—the education together in classes of young people in reading and book knowledge—spread. Schools became the major institution outside of the family to shape the attitudes of young people, and almost all those who later became intellectuals went through schools. There they were successful. They were judged against others and deemed superior. They were praised and rewarded, the teacher’s favorites. How could they fail to see themselves as superior? Daily, they experienced differences in facility with ideas, in quick-wittedness. 

&gt; The wider market society, however, taught a different lesson. There the greatest rewards did not go to the verbally brightest. There the intellectual skills were not most highly valued. Schooled in the lesson that they were most valuable, the most deserving of reward, the most entitled to reward, how could the intellectuals, by and large, fail to resent the capitalist society which deprived them of the just deserts to which their superiority “entitled” them? Is it surprising that what the schooled intellectuals felt for capitalist society was a deep and sullen animus that, although clothed with various publicly appropriate reasons, continued even when those particular reasons were shown to be inadequate?

&gt; There is a further point to be added. The (future) wordsmith intellectuals are successful within the formal, official social system of the schools, wherein the relevant rewards are distributed by the central authority of the teacher. The schools contain another informal social system within classrooms, hallways, and schoolyards, wherein rewards are distributed not by central direction but spontaneously at the pleasure and whim of schoolmates. Here the intellectuals do less well.

&gt; It is not surprising, therefore, that distribution of goods and rewards via a centrally organized distributional mechanism later strikes intellectuals as more appropriate than the “anarchy and chaos” of the marketplace. For distribution in a centrally planned socialist society stands to distribution in a capitalist society as distribution by the teacher stands to distribution by the schoolyard and hallway.

The important points, I think, are twofold. First is that intellectuals view themselves and their ""life of the mind"" as of a superior importance; this fits with my experience. The second is that the nature of their work pushes them toward a certain proposals and solutions. They live in a world of top-down solutions predicted on controlled efficiency. In the same way that a military-general-turned-political-ruler might organize his society in a martial order (Pinochet) or that a group of leaders used to low interference would organize a decentralized society (Founding Fathers) the academic seeks academic solutions. 

This leaves them much more prone to things like Hayek's fatal conceit, the folly that society could be optimized if only a central authority was in control and engineered the systems to his design:

&gt; Whereas, in fact, specialised students, even after generations of effort, find it exceedingly difficult to explain such matters, and cannot agree on what are the causes or what will be the effects of particular events. The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.
&gt; To the naive mind that can conceive of order only as the product of deliberate arrangement, it may seem absurd that in complex conditions order, and adaptation to the unknown, can be achieved more effectively by decentralizing decisions and that a division of authority will actually extend the possibility of overall order. Yet that decentralization actually leads to more information being taken into account.

There is also a general attitude of ""supporting complexity"" among intellectuals and a general opposition to ""common sense"" (or what the Transcendentalists would call ""intuition,"" though not in the modern everyday sense of that word). I shall end with vigorous quotes:

&gt; An intellectual may be defined as a man who speaks with general authority about a subject on which he has no particular competence.
&gt; - Irving Kristol

&gt; The course of every intellectual, if he pursues his journey long and unflinchingly enough, ends in the obvious, from which the non-intellectuals have never stirred.
&gt; -Aldous Huxley

&gt; An intellectual is a man who says a simple thing in a difficult way; an artist is a man who says a difficult thing in a simple way.
&gt; -Charles Bukowski",dbyqyq,"&gt;  ...and there is strong evidence that psychologists cannot accurately predict human behavior.

This is very untrue.  We can reliably predict a huge amount of the variance in a huge amount of behavioral outcomes.

&gt;  The publish-or-perish lifestyle of a researcher encourages both active unethical practices (rounding p-values) and more subtle psychological practices (like deciding which data points were flukes). Even discounting that, the nature of randomness and the nature of publication can result in a majority of published findings being incorrect.

Here, you're on solid ground.  The number one actually helpful thing I've learned from this whole kerfluffle is that sample sizes need to be bigger, period.  Everything else is either eminently bullshittable (pre-registrations are a goddamn joke) or bigger cultural changes that are bigger than one person.

BUT.  You shouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater, here.   Hilariously, the researchers pushing the REPLICATION CRISIS!!! have *themselves* gotten their share of (fair) flak for making THE REPLICATION CRISIS!!!!! a sexy finding lots of people are talking about and lots of people are willing to give grants about,  Hey, they gotta publish-or-perish too!  Absolutely 100% be skeptical of a finding based on a small sample size!  But it's not justifiable to say ""Well, there's a replication crisis!"" and use that to assume all research is bunk.  You gotta have a REASON to think something is bunk.

now, to your basic point:

&gt;  The second is that the nature of their work pushes them toward a certain proposals and solutions. They live in a world of top-down solutions predicted on controlled efficiency.

You haven't said what's wrong with this; you've just said people who believe it are prone to a certain mistake in reasoning.  But... ANY perspective renders you prone to SOME mistake in reasoning.  There are obviously cases where rarified, specialized knowledge are important and necessary.  There are also obviously cases where mob crowdsourcing will produce optimal results (and, of course, there are times when this is terrible).

Mass shooters don’t deserve sympathy just because they were “bullied”.,"There is a tendency to try to decipher why these horrible shootings happen and why anyone would do such a thing, and usually the media ends up humanizing the shooter by talking about how he was either “bullied” or alienated. 

Everyone in school is, at some point, a victim of and a perpetrator of some degree of “bullying”. None of it justifies premeditated murder, especially of random people. As far as bullying goes, the only violence which is acceptable is  self defense, such as hitting someone back if they hit you first. 

Alienation is a very real problem in today’s world. However, many if not most kids today are alienated to some degree. None of that justifies violence against innocent people. 

Finally, there are often legitimate reasons why a community might reject someone. If someone behaves in an unfriendly and unsavory way, people will be less likely to be friends with them. I strongly disagree with the proverb “a child not welcome by the village will burn it to feel it’s warmth”.

Cutlery should be placed at the end of a buffet line,"I'm not sure how strongly people feel about this, but it is definitely something that I've been annoyed by at almost every buffet I've been to. Almost always, cutlery is placed at the beginning of the buffet line, and by the time I get to the end, I realize that I needed to grab a spoon/fork/knife/whatever. Additionally, holding on to cutlery as you attempt to put food on your plate is kind of annoying, and it would be better suited to just grab at the end of the line after your plate is in order.

Customer service jobs will always suck.,"So everyone I know who has ever worked in customer service has experienced poor treatment from customers, rude customers, etc. I don’t think I have spoken to anyone who works with customers who doesn’t have a story like this.

And beyond that, customers tend to do things that seem to dehumanize workers - like talking on the phone while checking out, being excessively demanding, etc. Employees can’t do anything about these things because they are expected to act a certain way. For example, an employee can’t refuse something to a customer because the customer didn’t say please, or because the customer failed to be polite. 

One or two of these incidents would be fine, but because it happens so frequently they build up and lead to even bigger stress. Customer service jobs are also frequently the lowest paid and easiest to replace.

For these reasons, customer service jobs kind of suck. It also doesn’t seem like anything can be done about them sucking because customers won’t change.

What would change my view is someone proving that these interactions don’t have to be stressful, that there is something companies can (and reasonably would) do to make dealing with customers better, or something in that vein.

What would not change my view is anything related to how customers can behave differently, because I know there are good customers (I try to be one) but it’s not realistic to think that you can eliminate all of the bad customers.",eqhdwe,"What if you view *making every customer happy* as a challenge, and you really, truly enjoy such challenges?",ferzupa
"Building the Wall is not a partisan issue, and it is a great idea.","Building a wall along the U.S-Mexico border has been a hot topic that’s died off over the past few years. Before Trump, issues such as border security, limiting illegal immigration, and crossing the border being a criminal offense (as opposed to a civil one) were issues that both major parties somewhat agreed upon. 

Both [Bill Clinton ](https://www.c-span.org/video/?62882-1/president-bill-clintons-1995-state-union-address&amp;start=3772) and [Barack Obama](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/remarks-president-state-union-address) were in support of building a wall along the southern border before it became a partisan-issue. 

Beginning in 1993, under President Bill Clinton, the first border wall was erected, separating high crime areas San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico. Made of steel landing mats. “Prior to the construction of this fencing, large numbers of illegal immigrants would gather on the United States side of the border awaiting darkness to make a dash northward. The fencing largely ended this practice.” This was called [Operation Gatekeeper.](https://oig.justice.gov/special/9807/gkp01.htm)

When the 2006 Fence Act was introduced under President Bush, Chuck Schumer, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and Hillary Clinton (who were then senators) voted in favor of the bill. 25 Democrats in the senate and 138 in the house were also in [favor of the bill. ](https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/6061)

There are 3 main reasons I believe building the wall is a great idea: 

1. Violence in Mexico and Latin America overall/Criminal offenses committed by illegal immigrants. 

2. Lack of taxes paid/an overall drain on the system. 

3. Partisanship aside, to achieve goals that both parties have, you must limit illegal immigration. 

Point 1: 

Mexico is the second most [violent](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/05/10/527794495/mexico-is-called-worlds-second-most-violent-country) country in the world, with 23,000 homicides in 2016.

Five of the six most violent cities in the world are in [Mexico.](www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-mexico-tijuana-violence-20190314-story.html%3foutputType=amp)

When compiled per 100,000 people, [Tijuana](http://seguridadjusticiaypaz.org.mx/files/estudio.pdf), Mexico is the most violent city in the World. 

Crime:

Between 2011 and 2016 there were more than 730,000 criminal aliens in U.S. or state prisons and local jails during this time. They accounted for 4.9 million arrests for 7.5 million offenses. (The numbers, according to the GAO: 197,000 criminal aliens in federal prisons, arrested 1.4 million times for 2 million offenses, between 2011 and 2016; 533,000 in state or local facilities between 2010 and 2015, representing 3.5 million arrests for 5.5 million offenses.)
The arrests include allegations of more than 1 million drug crimes, a half-million assaults, 133,800 sex offenses and 24,200 kidnappings. Even more serious, the imprisoned illegal immigrants, over a five-year period, had been arrested for 33,300  homicide-related offenses and 1,500 terrorism-related [crimes](https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/693162.pdf.).

Point 2: 

In [2017](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53624), the Federal government spent $4 trillion, or 10.95 billion per day. The entirety of the nation’s taxpaying illegals don’t even pay enough in taxes to cover what the federal government spends in a day (because the 12 billion figure includes taxes paid to state and local governments).
And this is from eight million workers. The American labor force had roughly 160 million workers in 2017. Just for the sake of a thought experiment, if we were to replace the entire labor force with illegal immigrants, and have them pay all their state and local taxes to the feds, the Federal government would’ve collected approximately $240 billion in tax revenue in 2017, as opposed to the 2.8 Trillion (from income tax and payroll tax statistics) that the Federal government actually collected in 2017.

Financial Burden:

This [report](https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/2017-08/USCostStudy_2010.pdf) estimates the annual costs of illegal immigration at the federal, state and local level to be about $113 billion; nearly $29 billion at the federal level and $84 billion at the state and local level. 

Point 3: 

One of the primary goals of the Democratic Party is to implement M4A or a Public Option in regards to healthcare. Most 2020 Democratic [presidential candidates ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/medicare-for-all/) believe that undocumented immigrants should be covered under a government run healthcare plan. I believe this provides a massive incentive for more undocumented immigrants to inundate the border and further exacerbate our [asylum seeker backlog. ](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-working-stop-abuse-asylum-system-address-root-causes-border-crisis/)

[Most](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/sites/default/files/documents/___media_files_publications_issue_brief_2012_dec_1650_gray_hlt_care_undocumented_migrants_intl_brief.pdf) other countries that offer some form of government-run healthcare have strict limitations and guidelines on healthcare for illegal immigrants within their own nations. For them, illegal immigration is a more minute concern and the effects would likely be greater here in the United States. 

If you attempt to argue that the cost is too great, I’m likely going to question how fiscally conservative you generally are and will likely assume that you’re arguing in bad faith. 

If you attempt to argue that we should use technology rather than a physical barrier, I’m simply going to ask you why not both. U.S. Customs and Border Patrol [already](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/nation/trump-says-walls-work-its-much-more-complicated) uses a wide variety of tools to enforce border security, including drones, thermal imaging, radar and ground sensors.

If you argue that Visa overstays are a greater issue, ask you to still remain on subject. That’s a separate issue, but not relevant to the topic. 

Also, I’m already aware that the majority of illegal immigrants come from elsewhere in Latin America, not Mexico. This doesn’t change my argument at all. 

Change my view.

Edit: When referencing the wall, I agree that Trump was a doofus and his grandiose wall is overkill. I’m simply saying I believe a physical barrier is needed.

Edit 2: My mind has been changed. Thanks. I feel that people comment on these assuming the OP is some malignant racist. I’m not, I have respect for everyone, regardless of race. I legitimately came into this wanting to have my mind changed because I felt the opinion was faulty.",ln5stg,It doesn’t work.  That is all,gnyx7uo
"Art without any purpose whatsoever isn't art, but worthless trash","I've heard some people say that art doesn't need to have any purpose, but I disagree with that. Artist can have many goals in their mind:

1. Making it pretty - there is nothing wrong with using art as a tool to make your surrounding look prettier
2. Making it thought provoking - art being used as means of conveying some ideas makes perfect sense
3. Recording historical events - stuff like paintings showing some important historical events can be very interesting

I've probably omitted many more possible ""goals"", but you should get my point. Usually there is a purpose, no matter how trivial.

Now lets come to my point - what about art that has no purpose? It simply exists, doing literally nothing. My favourite example is when someone left his [glasses](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/27/pair-of-glasses-left-on-us-gallery-floor-mistaken-for-art) on the floor in an art galerry, and visitors thought that it was an art piece as well. If someone was to try and make an interpretation of it, they could probably come up with many theories.

Click that search tab at the top of the screen, go to r/unpopularopinion and tell me straight to my face that those opinions are unpopular. I cannot see a single title I don't agree with. I cannot see a single reason to disagree with this point of view but apparently there is because that thread of lies is burning a hole in my brain. Maybe I'm just being spoiled by iFunny's supreme lack of moderation. I don't know. But seriously, this is stupid. I don't know, maybe it's to keep things civil. But that defeats the purpose of the thread. Unpopular opinions are unpopular. If I stood outside an abortion clinic saying that is you think Down syndrome kids should be aborted then maybe you should stop being a coward and shoot all of them right now, the situation would be taken grossly out of context by CNN and my work opportunities would be ruined.

Unpopular Opinions should be a community of people seeking refuge from a world in which people proclaim free speech, but spit upon it when someone doesn't agree with them. It should be a place where you can air out those dirty little opinions society spits upon. You think fat people should man up and stop blaming genetics? You think astrology is real? You think eugenics is good? You don't think gender changing surgeries should be allowed? Like the idea of theocracy? You think homosexuality is wrong? You think we should bring child labor back? Do you think the executives of companies work hard and deserve the pay they get? Do you think taxing the rich same as the poor is fair? Do you think advanced technology is bad and we should return to more primitive means of survival? You think George Washington was a bad president? Think adult females wearing diapers is hot?

"Choosing not to vote says that you are content enough with the way that the government is currently run, not that you’re protesting the selection of candidates.","I was speaking with a friend of mine earlier this week about voting.  I had already filled out my mail ballot, and asked him how he was going to go about voting for this election.  He told me that he was not planning on voting, and gave two points on why he made this decision:

* ""Voting for the lesser of two evils is still voting for evil.""
* ""\[He\] would vote for a third-party, but because they're not likely to win, why bother wasting time to go vote when it won't really matter?""

These aren't verbatim quotes, but that's essentially what I understood he was saying.  He wasn't interested in pursuing that conversation further with me, and truthfully neither was I, but I was still curious about the implications of this decision.

From my current perspective, I can see two stances being argued based on the decision not to vote:

1. **""I don't like the stances of the two major candidates, and I refuse to vote for one just because I dislike another candidate more.  I disagree with the ways that either of the two major candidates would run this country, and** ***choosing not to vote says that I refuse to support either candidate.*****""**  This seems to be the stance of my friend, who to my knowledge has done at least some research into both the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates.  He disagrees with a number of the positions that either candidate holds to on various issues, and justifies his decision to not vote primarily on this.
2. ""**Not liking the stances of the two major candidates is not a good justification to not vote, especially since there are third-party candidates to choose from as well.  Though I may not agree with either of the two major candidates, c*****hoosing not to vote says that I am content with the way in which the government is currently run, or at least content enough that I do not wish to see it changed.***"" This is more of the stance I would take on the situation.  I personally have not done enough research on my own to feel comfortable with arguing one major candidate over the other, and that's on me.  Even still, I felt it important to cast a vote, and I did so.

The primary distinction between these two arguments is this: the first says that the implications of not voting are that a person disagrees with both major candidates, and thus are staying neutral.  The second says that the implications of not voting are that, even if a person disagrees with both candidates, he/she is accepting enough of the incumbent candidate's stances; that doesn't necessarily mean they support the candidate in question, but they don't see a need to change how the government is currently run.

To clarify again, I'm not asking about whether or not we should vote, and I'm not asking about whether or not it is acceptable to vote for one of the two major candidates simply because we dislike the other more; **I just want to know what choosing not to vote should imply to an outsider's perspective.**  My personal perspective is on the second point, though I would be interested in seeing a defense for the first, or even an entirely separate, stance on this topic.",jngf14,"The person’s right NOT to vote is just as important as their right to do so.

We should not desecrate dead bodies we find from ancient civilizations,"I feel like there's an argument to be had for bringing in artifacts, since they might be better preserved under the care of museum professionals. But when it comes specifically to dead bodies buried in tombs and such, I don't think we need to bring them up to the surface, run tests and experiments on them, and then show them off to people like it's not the corpse of a dead individual. If it's not a tomb then I guess it might be different, you can't just leave them there so you might as well take a close look. 

I also think there might be a bit of a etnocentric bias going on here, a bit of cultural disrespect. It always seems to be non-western cultures that get their graves raided and looted. Yes, it was a long time ago. But where is the limit to how much time must pass before it's OK to desevrate a grave? 100 years? 500 years? 1000 years? Will we even dig up George Washington's grave? I highly doubt it, because he's our guy. We don't want to disturb native American burial grounds either, but the dead bodies of cultures not connected to us seems OK to bother. 

Now, I might have several flaws in my reasoning. Feel free to point them out. I think a lot of the arguments will lean towards gathering knowledge about these lost civilizations, but then you need to convince me of some practical value in doing so over and over again when finding corpse after corpse. Show me why it's worth it, or what we have gathered from it that proves it's worth desecrating their tombs.",hno5rc,I really agree with this. When Britian Colonized Egypt.

"Saying being gay isn’t a sin but acting on it is, is completely ridiculous and unrealistic.","Let’s face it: In 99% of (adult) relationships people have sex. Obviously the 1% is for people who are asexual and don’t have any urges at all. 
One thing that really bugs me about the Christians “new” stance on homosexuality is that it’s okay to HAVE these feelings of attraction to the same sex but to act on them is the actual sin.

That explanation is unbelievably ridiculous and impossible to implement realistically. If someone has a crush on someone they are most likely going to pursue them. What is a gay person supposed to do, be celibate for the rest of their life? Having a desire and not acting on it for the rest of your life is impossible. If you had an alcoholic and put alcohol in his house and said ‘now remember, your desire to drink alcohol isn’t a sin, it’s only if you ACT on it that it becomes a sin” what the fuck do you think is gonna happen? I’m not comparing sexual attraction to an addiction, but the situation I laid out is similar to what Christians are subscribing to. Or another version might be if you put a starving person in a house filled with food and told them that the act of eating food was sinful but thinking about it wasn’t. 

The point I’m trying to make is there is no path Christian churches create where the gay people can even have a relationship. This is just so they can say ‘See? We don’t hate gays, we just hate when they ACT on their sinful urges!’ when in reality they really do hate gays people and are trying to ruin their lives by preventing them from finding someone that makes them happy as a life partner. 

TLDR; churches claim only acting on gay urges is sinful but there’s literally no way to have a gay relationship without acting on urges so they still hate gay people.

Edit; I’m seeing a lot of people say that pedophiles are expected to suppress their urges for the rest of their life. That situation is completely different because if a pedophile acts on their urges a child gets hurt, but if a gay person acts on their urges and enters into a consenting relationship with someone no one gets hurt (well I suppose god gets hurt but I don’t believe in him)",ez2mpc,"Monks manage it pretty well.

Last night's shooting was, in my opinion, justified. Whether or not you agree with me, it is a fact that the guy who got killed was armed. The protests in West Philadelphia are largely the result of misinformation. Many people, especially those prone to impulsive violence, do not read the article, and the headline needs to give a brief description of the event that is accurate. I believe that these headlines were crafted to maximize clicks, shares, and ultimately profit. Change my view!

CNN, which isn't exactly right wing, literally reports  

# Protests erupt after Philadelphia police kill Black man who was waving knife on street

So you're cherry picking articles that don't include the word and I find it a bit condescending that you're assuming the protestors aren't aware of it either. I know he had a knife and I still think it's barbaric.

Killing someone should be a last resort, period. Not everyone waving a knife around is evil. They could be mentally ill. The goal in any sane country would be to use restraining measures like tasers, rubber bullets, etc. Personally, I find it fairly disconcerting that someone can casually sit on a couch and calmly declare that this person deserved to die, when they've never met that person. This is a human life and you're not a mind reader.

In this particular instance, the officers did not have a taser on them and had no choice but to shoot. The protestors addressing this aren't dumb/uninformed like you're implying. Most people are sensible enough to recognize that if someone comes at you with a knife and you have no other option, you shoot. The problem isn't the officers, but the department itself, which sent these officers into a situation where they would have no choice but to shoot and restraining was not an available option. Which is incredibly dumb policing strategy.

The main political aim of the protests is not to villainize these two officers, but rather to divert funding away from departments like this with shoddy policing norms and shoot first policies, and move them towards specialized officers who are trained to restrain and deal with these situations in a much more effective way.

The fact that the victim was waving a weapon around, is utterly, utterly irrelevant and if you think someone who's potentially mentally ill should be killed instantly for posing a threat in public, there is something deeply wrong with you. What if that was someone you knew?",gagycy1
The public fear of using the N Word in America gives the word power and is unhelpful to society.,"The concept that ""the N word"" shouldn't be spoken aloud ever under any circumstances by anyone harms society by unnecessarily and artificially granting a word some almost magical power, so that it cannot be uttered. It's an ugly word with an ugly history. I'm not arguing that using the full word is good or appropriate, but treating it like voldemorts name makes its power *worse* than if it were treated like any other slur like cunt, fuck, etc. For example, saying ""You shouldn't call people n * * * rs"" is just as offensive as saying ""Your daddy's a n * * r"", even though they mean completely opposite things, and ironically for the sake of this argument itself I have to self censor the words in a meta way so my post doesn't get banned. Context matters, and the aura of ""no no word"" around saying N***r among grown adults calling it the N word is almost childish.",ep3od8,"Here's an excerpt from an [article](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/if-one-more-white-person-tells-me-about-the-use-mention-distinction-to-justify-saying-the-n-word-im-going-to-vomit/?rf=1) discussing the Use-Mention distinction

&gt;See, I get to mention the n-word, and white people don’t, because when I mention it, nearly all the other black people know why I said it. I can mention it with the confidence that most black people in the room will understand why I said it, most black people not in the room will understand if they hear about it later, and, *worst case scenario*, even if you take my mention completely out of context, most black people will say “whatever, he can say it.”  
&gt;  
&gt;And on this issue, black voices are the ONLY VOICES THAT MATTER. That’s the real “double standard.” It *only matters* if black people think my use OR mention of the word is justified, because black people are the only ones who know what we’re talking about when it comes to this particular word. We’ve PAID for that knowledge in BLOOD AND DEATH. A thousand white people could write me “I don’t like how you mentioned the n-word in your story” and I wouldn’t care. But ONE black person could write me and, you know, I’d at least consider the argument. I’d ask other black people I know and trust for their opinions. African-Americans have *special knowledge* of this issue simply by dint of living in this racist country.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ultimately, that’s what bothers the use-mention crowd of white intellectuals. They’re dealing with something they *cannot* understand, but instead of simply admitting the LIMITS of their knowledge they try to make something up they can understand. Instead of… LISTENING TO BLACK PEOPLE, they try to IMPOSE their way of thinking UPON black people. These are the kind of people who would correct a Roman’s pronunciation of Latin, if Cicero time-traveled into their Classics class.

I can't definitively say that black Americans *never* argue that white people should be allowed to mention that word in certain circumstances or that people should start to use it more in order to ""take away its power"", but I'm pretty sure the actual number is a margin of error away from zero, and every person I've ever heard making this argument has been white.

And before anyone throws an ""Ackshually, that's an *argumentum ad hominem*"" at me, I'll say that I don't care. Yes, if a word has been used as a harmful abusive slur enough, only the people who were targeted have opinions that matter. If society is going to abuse a group of people for generations, and then turn around and suggest to that group that they know better how to deal with the abuse that they created, that's not helpful.",feh4z21
Democrats will regret it if they ever get rid of the filibuster,"To preface, the filibuster in its current form is awful. So, I'm not saying that change isn't needed. What I do believe, is that if Democrats do get rid of the filibuster they will regret it.

Democrats will not hold onto the senate forever. The Republicans will be back in charge of both chambers at some point in the future. And if the filibuster is gone when they, AND Mitch McConnel is still senate majority leader....watch out. He's already proven he's more than willing to fight fire with napalm. And, if that filibuster is gone when that time comes, there is no doubt in my mind that Republicans will advance legislation that Democrats and the majority of voters find abhorrent, but there will be nothing they can do.

One argument for getting rid of the filibuster is it will allow the passage of the new voting rights bill, which many Democrats believe will help ensure Republicans aren't allowed to steal elections through gerrymandering and local voting laws the discourage certain democrat leaning demographics from voting. My response to that is that it is simply absurd to believe that Democrats will hold onto both the House and the Senate forever. Republicans will win again at some point, and they will enact revenge.

As it stands now, the filibuster gives Democrats the ability to block some of the more egregious legislative goals of Republicans, and I think it is foolish to take away that ability.

I think the better option is to overhaul the filibuster to make it politically difficult to filibuster, like it used to be. Require a quorum of the opposition to be present and for someone to hold the floor the whole time. By making it hard, it will incentivize the use of the filibuster only in the most politically expedient of times (like what Democrats recently did in Texas, which, again, is an example of how the filibuster can be a good thing).

I'm open to my view being changed I'm just very distrustful of what Republicans would do once in power without the filibuster.

Humans do not have Free Will,"I know it seems crazy but hear me out. Desire is one of the most basic human characteristics, and it's found in all people wether they want to admit it or not. It lets us fill our basic wants and needs but it also seems to do so at a price: our freedom. The very existence of desire makes it impossible to get away from, you can't stop yourself from liking or disliking(or wanting or not wanting) something it's just something that happens. Therefore, my argument goes as follows: 

You cannot choose to desire anything(meaning no matter what you will like/dislike something wether you want to or not),

every action you commit is done because of a desire and nothing else(meaning that in every situation you can draw your motives for the action back to your desire for something),

 therefore because you can't control this action, and this action accounts for everything you do, you do not have free control over your actions.

Tone-deaf people should not sing in public,"A tone-deaf person singing is really uncomfortable, jarring and on-par with noise pollution. If you can call the cops on neighbours for being too noisy or making a racket then this should be categorised similarly. Unless they undergo training or practice to solve this issue (if possible) then perhaps exceptions can be given when its compulsory (like national anthems, school songs, etc) or when they feel strongly about it (religious or another obligation), and otherwise so when absolutely necessary. Outside of that I don't see why tone-deaf people should continue to spread their tone-death.

"I don’t care if others choose to not get vaccinated, so long as I have an opportunity to vaccinate myself.","Let’s say there is a 95% effective vaccine available for a deadly communicable disease. Everyone who wants the vaccine—including myself, my family, my friends, and importantly everyone in the highest risk groups (e.g. elderly, the young, immunocompromised, etc)—have the ability to obtain this vaccine. If these things are true, I don’t really care if others choose to opt-out and allow themselves to be killed needlessly.

Why should I care if people who choose to be willfully ignorant of science put themselves at risk? If my mental math is correct, anyone vaccinated would be nearly a hundred times less likely to catch the disease. Maybe even more than 100 times less likely if they were wearing masks on top of the protection they gained from vaccination (like medical personnel might do). It seems to me that those opting-out of vaccinations would largely harm only themselves and other opt-out-ers. It seems cynical, but I’m not sure why I should care about the lives and health of opt-out-ers if they don’t care about themselves. Seems like survival of the fittest at work to me.

I struggle with this because in general I want to see less suffering in the world. At the same time, it’s exhausting to try to change the minds of people who are doing things that (I believe) harm mostly just themselves. At some point I just want to throw up my hands and say, “so be it. You want to risk getting yourself killed? Go right ahead.” As long as everyone who wants to be vaccinated gets an opportunity to do so, and the vaccinated group includes people most at-risk, I’m not convinced that opting-out is different from other dangerous situations people choose to put themselves in (vices like smoking or other drugs, sports like wing suit base-jumping, tornado chasing—i.e. potentially hazardous activities that I think people should have the right to participate in.)",k4p2i9,"Herd immunity.

Being against illegal immigration doesn't make you a racist,"This came to my mind over the recent outrage over ICE deportations. 

It seems nowadays being undocumented gives you some kind of moral superiority. Remember the investment banker lady who admitted she came in the country illegally and got praised for it? I've also seen a lot of posts on social media of people ""coming out"" as undocumented and receiving a ton of support (hence why they do it). It's like admitting to shoplifting and having no consequences. You aren't morally superior for being undocumented. The smart thing to do certainly shouldn't be declaring it on Facebook.

It shouldn't be surprising when an illegal immigrant gets deported. Sad? Probably. Deserved? Possibly. Racist? Hell no. In fact race shouldn't even be a factor. Either you broke the law or you didn't. My being against illegal immigration has nothing to do with the color of your skin. We're a country of laws, make no mistake.

The Royal Family is Stupid and People Should Stop Giving A Shit About Them,"Celebrating a dynasty of figureheads is very stupid because they literally serve no actual purpose beyond nationalism/entertainment. Why would you have your country rally around a monarchy, an antiquated practice that goes against modern day values of equal opportunities? Furthermore, why are we celebrating this particular royal line, one that has a long history of exploiting other nations?

More concerning is the corruption in the family. Prince Andrew was a colleague of Epstein, and the family has attempted to stop the taxation of their wealth, which they do not truly deserve. Each year, millions of taxpayers’ money goes towards a family controlling hundreds of millions of dollars. Why not put that money towards the homeless in the UK, rather than buying more guards and corgi handlers?

I sincerely hope people who follow the family think about why they are doing this. These people aren’t like other entertainers who actually produce something interest (like actors or singers), and even then we already have a problem of people stanning their favorite artists. Monarchy is honestly a shameful practice of nepotism undermining the people’s’ choice, so why not rally behind a better icon like the US does with the inanimate object: Statue of Liberty?

It's not quite that simple, the sovereign forfeits the revenue of the Crown Estate (a major landholding corporation that manages a portion of the ancient crown properties) to the exchequer and in return receives the sovereign grant - which is calculated at 25% of the revenue of the Crown Estate.

Now technically this Estate belongs to the sovereign not any one monarch - but to describe the sovereign grant as though the Royal Family is just grabbing taxpayer money is unfair. Consider if we did in effect 'execute' the sovereign and Queen Elizabeth II reverted to Elizabeth Windsor - who would be the rightful owner of the Crown Estate under law? Likely Elizabeth Windsor!

I don't think there are more than 2 genders,"I completely support the LGBT community, gays, bisexuals, lesbians and transgenders. Don't get me wrong, I'm not transphobic to actual transgender people (the people with body dysmorphia, disowned by family, felt that way their entire lives, going through surgery, etc.) I feel like social media put such a bad image on LGBT and made us look like we're delusional snowflakes that cry when you misuse our pronouns. I think the only two genders are males and females and that sex is synonymous with gender. I don't like how the non-binary, genderqueer trend on tik tok are piggy-backing on real transgender people and say ""you don't need dysphoria to be transgender"". I look at it as a mockery. They wake up one morning and decide they want to be called they/them, yell at people who mess up their pronouns, JUST started feeling that way when they found out about it. Very PC and offended over everything. Meanwhile actual transgender people have felt that way their entire lives and it wasn't a damn choice. They have to get expensive surgery done based on their body dysmorphia. Science supports that transgender people didn't choose to be that way. I haven't ever heard of science backing up being called xe/zem and then crying when people don't. Please send me a link if you find anything about science saying non-binary genders are a real thing, not intersex people. Being intersex is rare and is a birth defect. Being non-binary is a trend with pronouns in your bio, screaming that gender is a social construct.

As a bisexual girl, I'm starting to see what they mean because of the raging snowflakes who suddenly appeared in our community all because they feel like they want to be special by using some pronouns because of their dyed hair and piercings. I saw a video of a non-binary teacher making the kids say ""teacher (name)"". I know damn well she confuses and yells at the kids when they don't. Forcing grammatically incorrect way of speech on kids all because you ""feel"" like you don't want to be a girl or a boy. These people, in my opinion, think they are way too special. Entitled to make everyone around them use certain pronouns and start crying when you mess up. If you look like a girl, people are going to call you a girl, simple.

Anyway, please someone explain to me why it is so heavily accepted now. I want to know if it is scientifically backed up. Send me links, etc. because I genuinely want to know why people think this way and get mad when someone disagrees. ",nyiag2,"So I’ll go out on a flyer and promptly get downvoted to hell. 

I too, support the LGBTQI community, but how about this: gender re-identity surgery is free as a once lifetime procedure and after all the piece are changed over, you get the title, ID, etc that goes along with your new gender. 

Until that, your license, legal documentation are as your born gender and while it certainly wouldn’t be mandatory for friends and family to call you, your dead name; society as a whole should not be expected to conform to it until said surgery.

Private car insurance companies are bad and this function would better be served by the state,"Private insurance companies are motivated by profit. They are therefore inclined to find any excuse not to pay out on claims, which causes problems. It's also just more expensive to the consumer.

It seems like a better system would be to have the state increase road tax rates and use this money to effectively act as an insurance company, only without being driven by profit. This would be cheaper for drivers, fairer for people who need to make claims against someone, and it completely eliminates the problem of uninsured drivers which therefore also saves money in policing. If the state makes profit of insurance, the extra money could be reinvested in the state which saves the taxpayer money elsewhere or gives them a better service.

I think private insurance companies should still exist so that people can insure extra things if they want to (e.g. tyre insurance), but a system where the state effectively requires you to be insured by a private company is a bad idea- why not cut out the middleman and have the state provide insurance from road tax?",nytc9t,"Driving is a privilege not a right.

You should not have to work to eat.,"It's my personal/political belief that one should not be required to work in order to have life sustaining needs met like food, water and shelter as doing so places an undue burden on many people including but not exclusive to:

Those born with physical disabilities 

Those injured across the span of their life

Those who are sick and elderly

Forcing people to work to manage their basic needs means that your labors and efforts don't benefit you they simply keep you from starving or dying in the cold and to me this is morally bankrupt. So I'd like to hear some otber opinions on the matter, thanks in advance for your time. 

Change my view

Edit: Feel I should add that I do not intend to make food literally free the farmer and the truck driver who get the food to your local market should still be paid for their work and production of goods. Im imagining that everyone gets a UBI similar to disability payments but just for everybody.  Why would this not be a good idea? Thats my basic question.

any electric / electronic appliance made to be used inside and which uses 100W or less should be required to be powered via USB-C.,"It’s time. 

Look at all your power bricks on your house. I’ll come back to the kitchen in a second. 

Router, external disk drive, radio, speakers, lights, obviously phones and tablets/computers. 

They all have a power brick switching 120V or 240V AC to anything from 5V to 20V DC, at or below 5amps. This means 100W and is covered by the USB-C PD (Power Delivery) standard.

I have for example a single outlet used by a power bar where I plug
- my NAS drive (12V- 3A)
- Apple TV (AC but 15W peak)
- speakers (15V -2A)
- old Epson projector (300W)

Apart from the Beamer, everything could have one simple USB-C cable to a high power hub. Instead I have a basket full of big cables and inefficient power bricks. 

The discussion about Apple being forced by EU to maybe switch to USB-C just hides the elephant in the room below the carpet as to why anything at all allowed to be powered by USB-C shouldn’t be forced to. 

It would also logically follow that power outlets would then include a USB-C “charger” with one or more ports and eventually also have their own dedicated 20V or more DC cables to a bigger and more efficient transformer at the panel level. 

Change my mind. 

Exceptions would go to the kitchen where most appliances exceed this limit and actually require AC for motors. Washing and drying machines, vacuum cleaners (not portable) as well. But let’s discuss the rest. 

Thank you guys!!",v5dmgn,None of my appliances has power bricks. They just plug into a regular old outlet. So why add in the need for one?,ibb51c9
People who think invisibility is the best superpower are a bit creepy.,"“If you could choose one superpower, what would it be?” 

I use this question to judge people as part of my hiring process. It is far and away my favorite question to ask. I don’t judge people who want to fly, teleport, protect, or shapeshift, and it’s usually one of those or invisibility. When someone chooses invisibility I think they are creepy! Why would you want to sneak around and spy on people? Why are you afraid people in your life act differently when they think you’re not watching? 

A couple have answered like this “Mindreading? Wait, no, that would be awful, actually I don’t want to know.” Then they pick something else. People who pick invisibility are confident about their choice and don’t think twice about it. 

Enough people have answered with invisibility that I am now questioning my bias. What am I missing? 

Recently I asked the person to explain why. They said it was because they wanted to know what people would say behind their back. I then asked what they would do if they found out someone they thought was a friend spoke poorly about them. They answered, “I wouldn’t change my behavior, I would just know I can’t trust them, but they would never know why.” 

This person exhibited other evidence of avoidant communication style. I didn’t hire them. I’m afraid this was a case of confirmation bias! 

Are people who choose invisibility creepy?",m4i0in,"Presumably a subset of people asked what they would want a superpower to be imagine them using it in some super-hero like capacity in which case, given the context of the modern world invisibility makes a lot of sense. Flying and teleporting just provide faster and somewhat cooler ways of doing what we already have technology capable of and reasonably few modern day villains are taken down with overwhelming force where protection or shapeshifting into a powerful animal or machine would be attractive (and even in the cases where that was helpful, being invisible and carrying a gun would have a similar effect in increasing your odds in a physical confrontation). The kingpins, corrupt officials, gang leaders, and tyrants often rely on some degree of hiding their crimes from law enforcement or the general public which invisibility (or shapeshifting into a small, unobtrusive animal like a mosquito) would allow an individual to uncover.",gqupay5
The white teen who said the n word on a Snapchat video in freshman year should not have been dropped from the admission list of her college when a black student released the video 4 years later,"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/26/us/mimi-groves-jimmy-galligan-racial-slurs.amp.html

Here is an article explaining the situation ^

**Important edit: Mr. Galligon received this video in his senior year of high school, so he waited a few months until he discovered she was admited to college, and then released it. HE DID NOT WAIT 4 YEARS!** I’m so sorry for misinterpreting this part of the story.

Reasoning:

1) The girl said it when she was 15 (4 years ago)

-Mrs. Groves said this word as a child. Was it right? Absolutely not. But 4 years is enough to change anyone, and old statements should not be held against someone if they have shown change, especially when these were made as a kid.


2) She said this in a private message, not directed to any black person

-This of course does not make what she said better, but it makes the context better. She said “n words I can drive.” This was not said with any (intentional) hate, and was sent to a (presumably) white friend. This use of the n word is much better than say, a white person calling a black person the n word out of hatred.


3) She did not send this video to Mr. Galligan, or any black person

-This video was sent to Mr. Galligan by a friend, not Mrs. Groves herself. Mrs. Groves did not try to target Mr. Galligan with this slur, he merely saw her say it. Still a disgusting act, but it’s not like she was trying to be directly racist to Mr. Galligan.


4) She was raised in a racist environment

-In the article, it says that Mr Galligan reported the video to an administrator, and they did nothing. This shows that her environment did not oppose or take racism seriously. By not punishing racist actions of hers or the actions of her peers they are rewarding and validating it. This still does not justify her use of the slur, but it explains why she felt entitled to use it.


5) She had made an effort to change 

-Mrs. Galligan promoted blm, BEFORE the video was leaked. Yes, it was around the time it was “trendy” but it’s not like this was a last ditch effort to clear her name. While it might have just been performance activism, even promoting blm shows that she was attempting to change her ways. 


6) Mr. Galligan’s actions were sickening 

-Mr. Galligan has experienced much worse racism in school (white students directly mocking him with racial slurs), yet chose an instance of racism that was not directed towards him to expose. He clearly did not want to see real change, otherwise he would have posted stories and called out the racist bullies by name, no, he wanted to see Mrs. Grove’s life ruined. He did not let this go for 4 years, knowing that this could be used as a way to destroy something she loved, and when he found out what that was, he pounced. He released that video, knowing full well what the internet would do to that girl. 


7) Mr. Galligan is a massive hypocrite 

-In the article, Mr. Galligan details a time where his own father (a white man) uses the n word in a non-serious way, after living in an environment where the n word was used casually by black relatives. Do you know what he did? He calmly educated his father about the true meaning of that word. Mr. Galligan also details a time where he asked his father his opinion on white privilege. He claims it does not exist. Do you know what Mr Galligan did? He calmly educated his father about what white privilege is. 

Mr. Galligan’s father is a full grown adult, married to a black woman, and had a biracial son, and he was given more slack by Mr. Galligan than a 15 year old white girl, living with a white family, in an environment where the n word is used casually BY WHITE STUDENTS that are let off with no punishment. Mrs. Grove was in the perfect environment to create a racist, she used a racial slur once. And then moved on to promote blm years later, Mr Galligan’s father had no excuse not to know the true meaning of the n word or what white privilege is. Mr. Galligan was clearly capable of educating Mrs. Grove, because he has done it before with his father, instead he decided to bid his time, waiting for the perfect moment to ruin a changed girl’s life. 

As Mr. Galligan said himself (with satisfaction), “I’m going to remind myself, you started something. You taught someone a lesson.”

Economic growth is no longer a great indicator for social welfare,"This  view was partly inspired by the podcast linked below. If you don't want  to listen, the gist is that instead of trying to achieve limitless  growth, we should be striving for a balance (The ""doughnut model."" )  between meeting people's needs (avoiding the doughnut hole) and  overextending resources (extending beyond the outside of the doughnut).

[https://freakonomics.com/podcast/doughnut-economics/](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/doughnut-economics/)

For  the past century or so, economic growth has been strongly associated  with human and society advancement. A rising tide lifts all boats, and  as long as we were growing the GDP we were improving people's lives. It  brought us out of subsistence farming and into an era of prosperity. It  created and abundance of food, medicine, technology, etc. Human welfare,  life expectancy, leisure, etc all grew thanks to healthy production.  Endless debates were had on whether capitalism or communism was better  for growth. There is no doubt in my mind that we are where we are  largely because of the rapid industrialization and continued focus on  having the best economic growth.

People  have this assumption that this is still the case but it may not be. I  had this realization when thinking about the Republican platform... just  about every policy can be linked to their desire for unfettered growth.  Environmental protection, wealth distribution, etc etc are all seen as  2nd fiddle to a rising GDP. They have this fear or notion that anything  that slows the economy will ultimately crash western civilization as we  know it. I think this is no longer true, or at least it's only true  because we have foolishly structured society around this concept. We  have reached a point where production is no longer the issue. Human  welfare is no longer tied to production or new technology, but to  distribution of resources. A rising GDP now only gives us marginal gains  toward a healthy society, and in some cases is starting to work against  it, destroying the environment and leaving us vulnerable to catastrophe  and economic depressions.

Don't  get me wrong, I still think innovation and technology has the ability to  benefit society. But I think it is marginal at best. I'm not advocating  for abandoning production or for allowing the economy to stagnate. But I  don't think it's the most important factor. It isn't sustainable. We  have the resources and ability to have a healthy society with what we  have now.  In fact we have an abundance. Resources are limited, yet we  act like we can grow forever. We shouldn't be afraid of strong  environmental regulations, or wealth taxes, or welfare, or business  regulation. Will that stifle business growth and innovation? Yeah,  probably to some extent. Maybe even a large extent. But it doesn't  really matter if it means that social welfare increases and resources  are better preserved.

Of course  this view is largely centered on 1st world nation economies, there are  many economies around the world that can still benefit from rapid  economic growth (they are still in the doughnut hole, so to speak).",jb6d15,"&gt; Human welfare is no longer tied to production or new technology, but to distribution of resources.

Distribution of resources is production. More trucks, ships, and trains. Better communication systems. 

&gt; We shouldn't be afraid of strong environmental regulations, or wealth taxes, or welfare, or business regulation

If you took every billionaire's wealth in the US, you would get less than half what the US government spent this year, presuming that it did not negatively affect the economy at all. Wealth taxes only encourages industry to leave while doing nothing beneficial. You generate less taxes overall from enacting wealth taxes

Environmental regulations dont inherently accomplish their goal. Fuck over any farmer that reports that they have an eagles nest on their property by declaring it a wildlife sanctuary, and guess who just shot an eagle. Make dishwashers use less water at the expense of greater electric usage like energy star requirements do, and you only hurt the environment in areas with abundances of fresh water. Put a carbon tax on US goods, Chinese products become cheaper relatively and we produce more greenhouse gasses due to that. Just because you strapped the term ""enviromental protection"" on a bill doesnt mean it helps the environment

Welfare means less people working, leading to less goods and resources, leading to the individual suffering. There is a reason the median wage in Spain is lower than the US poverty line",g8tmki3
"As someone who really appreciates King of The Hill, Hank Hill is an overrated character","While the idea of showcasing overly conservative attitudes about religious beliefs and sexual attitudes and such is a good idea regarding life in small town America, shoehorning it all into one character who happens to be the main character of a TV show is not the best idea. Don't get me wrong, Hank has his funny moments, but I would rather have had Hank be a supporting character while we knew more about Boomhauer, John Redcorn and Dale's families while still focusing on Bobby and Peggy. Hank is arguably one of the least funny characters in the entire show.

Also, one episode shows how Hank is a hypocrite. He talks all day long about how propane is the best way to cook meat yet once Bill uses a wood fire barbecue pit to cook meat using a family recipe, he says that Bill made the best ribs that he has ever tasted.",l0p568,"Hank Hill, a good portion of the time, is the ""straight man"" to the various other characters in the show. Some really funny moments from the show come about because he's the one rolling his eyes or scoffing at the ridiculous antics of the other characters. He can also serve as an audience surrogate in many episodes. 

I would argue that the show would struggle if we had Hank off to the side. Audiences can really need someone that feels grounded and relatable at the center of the action so the show can remain relatable. Of course, Hank has his quirks and weirdness, but even then how he treats those foilables is relatable. His tendency to quickly feel embarrassed, shy, and exasperated... It's great stuff and a vital part of the formula that King of the Hill needed.

It's arguably THE formula the show was built on.",gjv5cy6
I don't like Europeans.,"This post might come back to haunt me, but I actually want people to change it if they can.  I think I'm prejudiced, but I can't argue with my reasons.  I've boiled them down into two main points.

Note: when I say ""European,"" I only mean the nations I dislike: France, Germany, Netherlands, and others - for the most part, the former colonial nations.  I don't have a specific word that encompasses only those Europeans, so I'm going to use the word ""European,"" even though it's not the most accurate.

1. The ingrained arrogance.  Europeans conceptualize themselves at the top of a ladder of civilizations, with everyone else beneath them, in 2019 no less than in 1919.  Singapore's ambassador-at-large, Tommy Koh, [said](https://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/08/does-europes-arrogance-blind-it-to-asia/?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=3C943769C9C7C244C3AE59E3E3BE1EDE&amp;gwt=pay) it publicly a few years ago, after a career spent trying in vain to communicate with European leaders.  Tommy Koh was the Executive Director of the Asia-Europe Foundation, the main body of the Asia-Europe Meeting, for context.  My view on this started to evolve when I realized that it's not just us Americans that Europeans consider beneath them, but pretty much all of humanity.

2. They don't really understand rights or democracy.  Most of Europe has been free for less than one lifetime.  Half (Spain and Portugal in the west, Warsaw Pact in the east) has been free for 30-40 years.  The nations with longer democratic traditions are mostly small, isolated nations who have never had a large or diverse population to govern and whose democracy is therefore still fairly rudimentary (there are no laws to record political lobbying in Sweden, because [they don't see the need](https://www.thelocal.se/20130430/47636)).  For much of the continent, any kind of freedom is still a fairly new thing, and the fact that we Americans are so connected to them, with a large number of us influenced by their political trends, makes me worried.",cdjaiq,Before I try to convince you: Are you white?,etug1vh
Scholarships should have an income cutoff so that the money goes to students who are financially disadvantaged rather than those who would likely be alright without them.,"Something I noticed when I was in high school was that the recipients of the scholarships all seemed to come from upper-middle class backgrounds. You'd have someone already in a financially well-off situation with their loving and caring parents who had easy access to whatever they needed to get a task done easier and faster getting large sums of money for something they would likely otherwise be covered for.  


When you come from a family that has money and cares about you, you're statistically more likely to succeed. You're able to have at-home resources such as a computer to do homework on, be able to buy those expensive, high-end calculators that have become *a requirement* for math classes, have more supplies to do hands-on projects, pay school fees, and access out-of-school assistance like tutors and the likes.  


Take that in comparison to the student who works just as hard, if not harder, and is unable to do as much because they need to financially support the family, have no internet access at home, come from an abusive household, can't afford the high end calculators thus failing the class, unable to pay school fees, and can't afford out-of-school assistance at all.  


Schools always choose the person who seems to have the highest-quality output of schoolwork and involvement when they should take into account the student's background. It's easy to be successful and have high-quality school work and involvement when everything you need is given to you. Schools should focus more on who's falling behind and give assistance to them rather than those who come from family environments that would likely see them succeed regardless.

On top of that, why give $1000, $5000, $10,000 or as I've personally seen $60,000 to someone who comes from a high-income background to begin with? ***You're basically rewarding people for the way they were born rather than their true accomplishments.*** You're telling that low-income student that it doesn't matter that they worked their ass off just to get that ""B"" mark because of their disadvantages, but all that matters is that they just weren't rich enough, and that's just morally disgusting for anybody to do.",clyqdc,"An incredibly large portion of scholarships do at the very least take ""financial need"", into account. Is it possible that you came from a fairly wealthy community? Because I think that would explain why anyone was even receiving $60,000 in the first place (unless of course this was a merit scholarship through that students college or university). Personally, I had very limited access to local scholarship, and had to mainly go for long-shot awards, but I found that many scholarships that were offered had minimum GPAs around 75 or 80, and almost all of them factored financial need. Further speaking personally, I come from a relatively poor community, at least below average in financial terms, and as one of the most accomplished students from my high school (arguably the most accomplished), I got $1,000 in local scholarships. My family was pretty well off, but my financial situation had a huge impact on where I could go to school (although, I recognize for some people its whether or not they can go to school at all). These $1,000 mean a lot.",evz9sq0
The US government should add a surcharge to fast food and use the money to subsidize healthcare.,"

Countries such as Switzerland do this and the results is that people ending up ordering a fraction of the items per meal because of the increased cost.

The low cost of fast food creates an environment where people are incentivized to order more food than they actually need or even want. This results in people ingesting more calories than their body requires. In addition, the food typically served at these establishments is high in trans fat and simple carbohydrates, and at the same time low in micro nutrients. All of these factors are detrimental to overall health and put a strain on our country's healthcare system.

Some have argued that this proposed surcharge disproportionately affects lower earners, however, I would argue that this tax would push those lower earners to find alternatives (generally healthier) and to consume less overall.",j0oum1,How would you go about determining whether or not a business qualifies for the tax?,g6w96r4
"The American Flag is starting to represent American Nationalism more than equality, liberty, and freedom","My mom who is a lifelong Republican (but a Trump hater) said oh look there's a Trump flag the other day and I said I couldn't see it but then she pointed at the American flag.  She said these days the nationalists and fascists love to rally behind the flag and they have no interest in democracy or the things the flag was initially supposed to represent.

I actually had not thought of this but it was hard to dispute her.  It seems like all the people who love to rally behind the flag the most are often the most hateful right-wing people who aren't interested in liberty towards other people who they don't identify in their group.  To non-Americans I'm sure the flag generally represents oppression and bad feelings these days.

Just kind of seemed depressing to me that the American flag got hijacked by military imperialism internationally and far-right fascism/Nationalism domestically.  Hopefully some can give me another view how the flag isn't just becoming tied to toxic ideologies as of now and going forward.",m00ce0,"We shouldn't allow our flag be co-opted by the worst segments of our society.

Summer assignments for school are an insult to the very idea of summer vacation,"Basically, the title is my entire idea. When students are about to get out of school for the summer (at least in middle/high school for the US) and are prepared to relax, they instead get hit with multiple assignments to be completed over the summer. How this idea managed to get started I have no idea, and any reasoning I could possibly think of has a very simple reason it's wrong.

For example:

1) People will forget concepts over the summer - If so, how is everyone 2-3 years out of school not completely stupid and forgetting how to do everything they learned (An alternate argument could be that the information isn't worth learning in the first place, but that's another topic)

2) It helps prepare students with the new topics for the next year - Maybe cut down on the curriculum some and skip over the stuff that they won't need to learn or practice as much. *Edit:* I'm adding an additional point here, which is that if students are expected to start learning by themselves over the summer, why pay teachers in the first place to come into school? Just set up a chat system to clarify points and leave students at home.
 
3) It encourages students to read over the summer - This one only applies to English summer assignments, but most of the time, if students are going to read, they'll do it because they are interested in the content. You can get 100x more use out of any information online than you can out of most conventional books.

None of those arguments will change my view at all, unless there is something huge that I'm missing with it.

And finally, if you were at your job and took a vacation, you would laugh in the face of any person trying to give you something to work on over it. [A vacation is a break from work, not more time to do it.](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vacation)",cfqadt,"Can I ask what the reason is for the summer work? 

Is it because they made it into an advanced class?

Is it because they failed to meet minimum requirements for moving on?

Or is it just work that the school gives out?",eudzimx
Hate Speech exists and is not mutually exclusive with Free Speech,"If you agree that there is such a thing as hate, then you must necessarily agree that there is such a thing as hateful.

Hate speech: abusive or threatening speech or writing that expresses prejudice against a particular group, especially on the basis of race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We can acknowledge hate speech without legally restricting free speech. Acknowledging hate speech is not necessarily the same as advocating for or implementing laws that would restrict hate speech.

I believe that those who refuse to acknowledge that hate speech exists generally do so because they fear that by acknowledging it, they're giving a foothold to laws (and to a lesser extent policies by private entities) to ban certain speech. 

Raising the point ""but who decides what is hate speech?"" doesn't actually disprove the existence of hate speech. 

Appealing to the ""free market place of ideas"" doesn't disprove the existence of hate speech (and doesn't even guarantee that good ideas prevail over bad ideas. Good ideas being ones that have integrity and/or facilitate some goal and bad ideas being ones that lack integrity and/or don't facilitate some goal, or worse, is counter productive. By integrity I just mean ideas that are honest, rational, and objective).


We can more or less objectively evaluate whether some speech is hateful or not (both by looking at the connotation/definitions/context of the speech, but especially by observing the consequences). What speech should be banned, by who, where, when, why, and how is a different conversation. 

And if you must know, here is *my* position on free speech. I think it is very useful to think of free speech as generally the lesser of two evils (that is free speech for all, or free speech for some or no one). That is, I think a society that has free speech is generally better than one that doesn't, but I also acknowledge that free speech has a cost itself. 


After all, it's ridiculous to deny that speech has no consequences for society/individuals, if such were the case we would not ever desire to see the rise or decline of certain ideas. If enough people have hate for a group in society, it stands to reason that there will be increasingly adverse consequences for that group as hate for them increases (though the exact details depends on their position and numbers, as well as the position and numbers of those who hate them). 

It should be obvious, but I think a society with less hate speech is better as well.",bx46xe,"I think the problem is deciding who will regulate it. Free speech has no opinionated bias regulating it. Hate speech must be regulated. Who is to say, ultimately, what is hateful and what is not. People get so offended these days, will it be regulated by what makes someone offended? Because there will be no speech allowed. 

The line is drawn at a call to action right now. You can not say go kill trump, but you could say I hope trump gets hit by my car. Personally I think this is a fair place to regulate speech in a sense. I know I contradicted myself somewhat here but it’s clear.",eq4du64
People who talk about how a country should copy another countries political system's are really dumb.,"Whenever I hear anyone talking about how another country does something ""better"" so there country should do it it makes me shake my head and faceplam. And not only that but no one seems to understand how hard it could be how big the risks could be or that it could just fall flat on it's face. This automatically gives me huge doubts. If someone stopped talking about how good something is working on the other side of the world long enough to come forward with with how to implement, how to deal with any risks, how to it will be better (using facts) I might be able to get behind it. 

Just because it works in another country doesn't mean it's going to work for yours or others.

Countries are very complex firstly do the people even truely want it? Does the system that you want to copy (maybe not even fully) conflict with the system's the copying country has already? Countries have unique problems and unique solutions to the problems as they should.

Something I also see no one talk about is how the world as a whole could benefit from countries being different. If the USA were to demilitarise to the point some other countries have war's would break out before we even knew it. This goes deeper as well the USA playing the defender for other countries allows them to put more money into different things they could not if they were not being defended this could also be the same for other system's.",c5zvvn,"You don't have to copy an entire political system; you can just copy things piecemeal. It's very unlikely that a transposed political system will work the same in a different country, but you could make modifications to various institutions using the ideas that have worked elsewhere.

A couple of caveats:

1. Often when people propose copying something from another country, they misrepresent the other country. For example, the Nordic countries are depicted as far more progressive than they actually are. Furthermore, there is a tendency to ignore the problems that these other countries have experienced with the proposed solution to be copied.
2. If you wish to copy something from another country, you should avoid mentioning that your idea is from there, as this will create needless opposition.",es6b0rd
There is nothing transphobic about not being attracted to trans people,"Since it's clear that gender and biological sex are two different things, the first being a set of social constructs and expectations that are assigned to everyone at birth based on the second, being trans would imply that these two aspects don't match in a person. For example, someone who is biologically male might not feel comfortable living his life the way a typical male is expected to, leading to him wishing to, or hopefully managing to make the transition to female.

But, physical attraction isn't based on identity, but on each individual's response to the biology of someone else. A gay man isn't (initially) attracted to other men based on them identifying as a man, but by the physical, biological characteristics that come with being a biologically male. 

\*\*Please take into account that I'm talking about averages here, of course some gay men are attracted to more feminine looking men, some straight men are attracted to more manly looking women etc. However, these aspects regarding attraction that I'm discussing here are generally true to the majority of the population. Also, I'm speaking about INITIAL attraction, since of course a very attractive person who has a bad personality turns others off.

Now, I've seen people argue that if a straight man says he would not date a trans woman, that makes him transphobic because, allegedly, he doesn't see her as a woman. However, attraction doesn't have anything to do with respecting other people's identity. This hypothetical man I'm talking about isn't attracted to the identity of a woman, but to her physical characteristics. He would just as well not feel any attraction whatsoever to a cis woman who is tall, has a deep voice, or has a wider frame. It won't matter to him that she was both assigned female at birth and that she still identifies as such, all that matters is whether her traits match the feminine traits he naturally finds attractive.

The sad reality is that the success stories we find of people transitioning are not the norm, but outliers. The vast majority of trans people simply don't have access to all the hormones and reconstructive surgeries they would need to look completely indistinguishable from the opposite sex. Plus, bottom surgery is a MAJOR operation that maybe not everyone is ready to go through. It's not something you do during your lunch break. And while it is tragic that there is not simpler alternative to changing your genitals, people are completely entitled to their preference of these. It's not all about ""seeing women as walking vaginas"" or ""seeing men as walking penises"", if your straight, you have absolutely no interest in ever interacting with genitals that are the same as your, and if you're gay there's absolutely nothing wrong with not wanting to interact with genitals that are different. 

TL;DR: Attraction is not based on respecting someone else's identity, but on biology. You can respect trans people without being attracted to them.

EDIT: I have posted this about 5 hours ago and I have received many many responses. Unfortunately they all fall into the same two different types of arguments and I'm tired of responding to the same comment multiple times.

1. What if a person is already clearly transphobic and he refused to sleep with a trans person? Isnt that transphobic?

Yes it obviously is, but the refusal isn't what makes the person phobic, he already was.

2. What if a person already started dating a trans person and later finds out he/she's trans and dumps them? Isn't that transphobic?

Of course it is. That's my point, any while a valid argument, we are here to debate, not to validate each other.",l188e7,How can anyone claim they will never be attracted to people they haven't even met?,gk0mfb8
The U.S. should continue to keep a presence in the Middle East,"The war on terror has been extremely unpopular in the past years. This is mainly because many people see it as pointless, prolonged, and a waist of American lives and money. I recently had a debate with a few people on r/Virginia about the necessity of the war on terror. This made me realize the true unpopularity of my opinion. I argued that the US presence in the Middle East is the only thing defending Afghan, Iraqi, est. civilians’s from human rights violations. Citizens in these countries face constant threat of rape, blackmail, and even murder on a daily bases. People get beheaded, hung, and stoned for having an education, being gay, or having a different religion or denomination. The only thing that suppresses these atrocities are American/ U.S. trained/Allied personnel. Additionally the U.S. military is 100% volunteers . This means that each soldier knows what they are getting into when they sign up. To help better support this argument, 1% of the military is combat arms. 10% of combat arms will ever see combat (admittedly, I have no clue how accurate this statistic is). This means that the vast majority of our military is in a supportive role or is doing something completely unrelated to the war on terror.

"I will totally support acting ""terrorism"" on Comcast for demanding better internet.","Living in an apartment with no other choice aside getting stuck with Comcast really sucks. It's even worse if the service goes out every other day. But I will pay my full respect and support to people who deliberately damage Comcast devices or jamming Comcast signals as an act of ""terrorism"", requiring them to lower the price and broaden the bandwidth.

At first it may not cost Comcast too much, but this cost can build up faster with wider and wider campaign. Raging people will be calling customer service, and the calling center workers on the other side won't be able to figure out what is the problem, thus submitting tickets for tech to inspect damaged nodes or jammed cords. At the same time, ""terrorists"" will utilize social media or forums for posting their request: fairer pricing, wider bandwidth and NO DATA CAP. It should attract customers from other ISPs to mock poor Comcast users, and ideally, catching public attention for triggering protests and FCC investigation against unfair pricing and data usage limits.

In the short term it may seem like a total lose for customers like us. However, if this campaign were to success to some certain degree, we will be the ones benefit from lower rate, better bandwidth and no data cap, i.e. reasonable service we deserved. It is worthwhile for me to pay the short term costs for long term profits. Therefore, I take anyone who are in it with a high regard, I will never be on the side of criticizing them or demanding them to stop. On the other hand, I will join the calling force on Comcast customer service demanding tech inspecting, even I fully understand the company has not technically done any thing wrong for causing this turmoil.

Disclaimer: I will be fully supportive and respectful, but this **does not** mean I have the ball of doing so. That is, if this ever happens, I will be on the side of requesting Comcast submitting to the requests, rather than condemning those who carry out the campaign, even if they are pushing it further than damaging laid out devices.

Bigots and shitty people in general should not lose their jobs simply because their bigotry (or unpopular opinion) gets leaked to the public,"Alright, this is a hot topic, so a throwaway with a loaded name just in case. 

For a while, and now more than ever (e.g.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/JusticeServed/comments/h9qd31/this\_made\_my\_monday\_a\_little\_easier/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JusticeServed/comments/h9qd31/this_made_my_monday_a_little_easier/) ), I see people losing their jobs because they show their bigotry (or more rarely simple social conservatism) in public, get recorded on video, become viral, and lose their jobs. They lose their jobs in private companies, companies that have nothing to do with politics. They lose jobs, where their performance does not depend on their public or social views (this is an assumption). 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't see a job as simply a way for an individual to make money, it is also a foundational pillar of the economy and a functioning society. As such, a good performance on a particular job helps not only the performer and the employer, but also the society as a whole. I don't care what my barista does in his free time; all I care about is whether (s)he makes good coffee. I don't care how my mathematics professor views the BLM movement; I care whether (s)he can explain the material well. I dont care whether a financial analyst records his wife being an asshole and embarrass herself; i care him being able to make predictions about the markets (well, not me personally, someone does). 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my overall point is that public perception is overreaching its authority right now. Public perception should dictate some terms in employment of public offices. I dont see a place for public perception to dictate the terms of employment in non-public roles.  CMV!

&amp;#x200B;

p.s. I recognize that my argument and POV are weak in situations, where a company is client-facing, and can see a drop in clientele in response to a high-ranking employee being exposed as a bigot. that wasn't the situation in the example I provided above, so I appreciate you CMV about non-public employment/company situations.",ha6ibt,"So using the barista example: if someone is the subject of a super-super viral video, it is likely a large portion of the public will recognize them on sight, and some may go seek them out because people are dumb.

"As Virtual reality immersion increases, VR may eventually become nearly indistinguishable from experiences in real life. This could potentially pose a problem- in which a person could willingly, or unwillingly experience themselves as a violent culprit, or a helpless victim","Virtual Reality experiences, may eventually become nearly indistinguishable from experiences in real life. This could potentially pose a problem- in which a person could willingly, or unwillingly (depending on the simulation) experience themselves as a violent culprit, or helpless victim. 

I recognize that some of you may argue that ""virtual reality"" is just a game. And those characters we experience in virtual reality are not real, therefore we should be able to do whatever we want those simulated characters no matter how realistic the virtual experience. But no, not necessarily. Why? Because thinking that VR is just simulation or a ""screen"" is missing the big picture... 

this technology- that allows us to experience such VIVID and immersive experiences, could eventually lead us to the point to where the experience of killing someone in actual real life will be nearly indistinguishable from killing someone in a virtual one. (In terms of sensory perception and what your brain perceives)! SEE EXAMPLE VIDEO BELOW

I'm not arguing for simulation theory either. Because obviously there is always going to be some difference between physical reality and virtual reality, but in spite of that, I'm arguing that- that difference between (physical and virtual experience) will appear to get SMALLER and smaller the more that virtual reality immersion increases.

This is why I believe there may be potential problems with VR immersion and violence. Therefore, **we should discuss these implications, and share these warnings, before this immersive technology arrives. That way, we can get a head-start, if you will, on how to regulate, and utilize these VR experiences for the better, instead of the worse.**

**Example videos: Early stages of VR slippery sloping into sadism simulations.**

This video shows players killing stabbing a VR character to death. Notice that the players actual physical movements- are closely synchronous to the physical movements of actually stabbing someone. Notice I use the word ""movement"" here, because that's all that killing really requires. Specific movements that are engaged in virtual reality may eventually become synonymous to the movements in physical reality. Why? Because the physical ""player"" can be required to MOVE his/her body in order to move their virtual body....

The problem? Well, the virtual reality simulations may eventually end up *dictating* a physical player's movements to such a specific degree, that the physical player's are fixed TO that VR simulation, predicated upon the rules of the VR. In other words, whereby the virtual reality simulation dictates MORE of physical players movements, than the physical player can dictate his or herself.


Again this not ""fear mongering"" at all. Instead, this is simply a bringing forth the discussing of these possible implications of the usage of VR technology so that we may discuss how of future of VR can be utilized for our advantage rather than our disadvantage. So that we can recognize that it may be possible for future VR simulations to be used for sadistic purposes, therefore from merely recognizing that possibility, we can allow ourselves to discuss ways to prevent it from happening- and thus, provide a safe, futuristic world for everyone.",c0273v,"People once made the exact same impassioned arguments about movies.

Jesus Christ would have worn a mask and encouraged his followers to do so as well. Wearing a mask is Christ-like.,"Christ taught that we all deserve love, care, and protection from harm. Christ taught selfless sacrifice for the wellbeing of others. Christ taught that no person is less deserving of love an safety than any other person. Christ would have dutifully worn a mask--the thing that has been basically proven to curb the spread of a deadly disease. Christ would have worn a mask to save other's lives and to make others feel safe and loved. Christ would have encouraged his followers to wear a mask.

Protecting others is Christ-like. Making a personal sacrifice to keep others safe is Christ-like. Showing others you care about their wellbeing is Christ-like. A mask does all of these things. Wearing a mask is Christ-like.

EDIT: In this hypothetical, I mean to suggest: ""If Christ had the same information we currently do about the nature and spread of COVID, he would choose to wear a mask and encourage his followers to,"" not ""If COVID randomly happened in biblical times, with the very limited medical knowledge they had, Jesus would have miraculously known to wear a mask""

EDIT 2 (since y'all seem to be confused about WHY we're being asked to wear masks at all): The face coverings that everyone should be wearing are to lower the chances that the wearer from spreads COVID to other people, not to lower the chances that the wearer from catches COVID. Since many COVID carriers are asymptomatic, any of us have the potential to spread the virus. Unless you JUST got your negative test results back, you simply don't know if you are carrying the virus. The face coverings keep microscopic moisture droplets that exit our mouth and nose (which the virus can live inside) from entering shared air space. Face coverings also do an ok job of keeping those droplets from entering our mouth and nose, but this is not the mask's main function.",hmz2r1,"I think the more interesting point is that as Jesus, he's the son of god, and also god at the same time. Seemingly, then we shouldn't be asking whether he's wearing a mask. It's his fault that we're in this mess. God punishes people, and one of the punishments is disease.

I think it's only logical to conclude that He chose to kill a hell of a lot of people for no apparent reason, given god's habits of sending plagues, floods (which have been going up), natural disasters, and so on. Also, global warming. So it seems like genocide is christ-like.

Also, are we going to praise him for curing a leper, when we know that he was the one that made that guy a leper?

And ignoring all the uncomfortable stuff above, I think the whole point of Jesus is that he did the difficult things. He wouldn't have stopped at wearing a mask. That's something that any dutiful citizen would do. He would have been helping those in need. He would have sought out those who needed help. He would have perhaps have cured people who'd caught it (although it's his fault in the first place). So, wearing a mask is only christ-like if we say that wiping your arse is christ-like. The real people who have been christ-like are those who've actually done the difficult jobs that needed doing. Like the doctors, nurses, care home staff, emergency services, and those who've volunteered to help out, who have put themselves at a considerable risk and inconvenience in order to provide help to people.",fx8otg0
arrying an extra magazine for self defense is pointless.,"I've been carrying a handgun as a concealed carrier for about 3 years now, I've never carried an extra magazine despite it being a popular suggestion among carriers as I find it to be pointless and just another thing I have to put on my person. 

In the highly unlikely event I'll need to fire my carry gun It has 11 rounds 10+1. Statistically a defensive gun uses is between 1.5 and 3 rounds fired. That gives me a wide margin even if I panic fire which is unlikely. 

I think getting into a gun fight/defensive use, having an issue that can be fixed with a magazine change, having time to due that during an imminent deadly threat and successfully defending myself is so unlikely that I don't think I should bother.

Social Media is responsible for the rise of mental health issues and self-esteem issues in Generation Y and Z.,"I'll start with the self-esteem issues. It's a combination of 2 things, the ability to edit one's appearance and tying ones worth to the amount of likes or good/nice comments. All the ""Influencers"" have these filters that makes them look perfect, or manipulate angles and it leads to people feeling like they are not beautiful for not being able to meet impossible standards. Plus its everywhere on social media. Due to survival instincts every mean or bad comment or dislike weighs more on most people than positive responses meaning that often those few negative comments can weigh heavily on a person and bring them down despite being the minority of responses.

Mental illness is being caused by two big things as well. Anonymity and the fact that it's been proven, people don't see ""avatars"" or online users fully as humans. People will always be less filtered when they don't have to show themselves because we won't face social or financial or legal punishment for what we say so no risk on the senders end. The reason we don't see people online as fully human is because we don't have visual or auditory emotions to go off of, this was demonstrated in the early internet where someone kept sending emails pretending to be the woman's dead father until she send him an email detailing how he was hurting her and then he stopped the trolling because for him it was in fun until he realised fully the human impact of his actions.

We are more connected than ever before but it has not been 100% good.",g8gfiq,"I can honestly see your point and agree, However I would not at all consider these to be true mental illnesses.

It's wrong to not teach children HOW to stand up for themselves against bullies.," I'm mad as hell and I can't take it anymore. My lovely parents who taught me many wonderful things taught me to turn the other cheek. I'm so pissed as I realize that they just set me up for bullying. 

I was bullied like many kids. I was taught at home to ignore it and walk away. AAAARRRRGGGG That is an adult function, not a 13-year-old. 

What I should have done from the start is be less of a p\*\*s\* and stick up for myself. I'd let girls walk past me on the stairs and elbow me or make some snide comment for everyone to hear. I literally can't remember their exact words, but they stung because I knew I'd just take them on. Then, once you have the reputation of not standing up for yourself, you're fresh meat for the next bitch. 

While knowing that my parents wanted to teach me right, they did me wrong. I should've been taught to turn around and get in the face of said bullier and at least fight for myself. I should've been given the right to defend myself. *I should've been given the tools to at least have a fighting chance even if it got me in a fist fight.* 

Every time I hear about bullying in my adult life I just get infuriated. It's always about ""we don't accept bullying"" or ""zero tolerance."" Bullshit, they're trying to control the bullier. The only thing to stop bullies is for the person being bullied to fight back. There will always be bullies, but if they don't have anyone to bully, they'll lose their job. 

**Parents, teach your kids how to stand up for themselves and support them in school if they get in trouble for doing so. Please, I beg of you parents (and I'm not one by choice) to teach your children exactly that.** 

I'm pissed that I've spent my life feeling like I ""have"" to turn the other cheek. It has caused more problems than I can put on paper. I'm just now, at almost a half a century, figuring out HOW to stand up for myself. 

I'm less of a p\*\*s\* than I used to be, and I'm thrilled. I'm just pained for kids these days and hope we, as a culture, stop focusing on fixing the bully when it's time to fix the bullied and empower them. The bully will move on to the next guy and let's hope he gets a door in the face.",ve958u,"r/LostRedditors

It isn’t right to judge historical figures on the moral principles of today,"I’ll elaborate a bit further. If a person (let’s say 200 years ago) is merited as an important figure for an achievement still celebrated today (let’s say leading a country to victory in war), then I find it wrong to judge them for beliefs they would’ve have had common for the time (let’s say racism). For example, Winston Churchill isn’t being remembered the racism he held which fit with the times, but rather for the fact he pulled a broken country through a gruelling war. In this way, I find it wrong to discredit his works because he was just as racist as any other politician or civilian at the time. On the other hand, if a person is purely being celebrated for something that isn’t today morally right (ie being an important slave trader), then I can understand why they are to be judged. However, that does not necessarily mean that they are to be removed from history",h85oj2,"I think I can guess the context of your post and my biggest problem with your view is the line 'that does not necessarily mean that they are to be removed from history'.

Nobody is removing anyone from history, what is happening is we're examining our view of these people. Most Britons today don't know about Churchill's views on race or his connection to the Bengal famine and his reputation is tarnished by these things (although not destroyed). It's not a bad thing to know that our heroes were less thanperfect, it doesn't mean we don't appreciate the good they did, but we recognise their flaws.

Other situations are different. Edward Colstone is not an important historical figure, he was just a merchant who got rich from slavery. This is not a figure worthy of having a statue so let's take it down. Again, we're not removing him from history, we're just trying down a statue of a figure we shouldn't celebrate. He's still in the history books, of you want to know about the slave trade you can read about him, but let's not have a statue of him.",fup3tue
There is no practical use-case where Blockchain Technology is the best option,"I am not a crytpo expert. I am a software developer with a degree in AI, however, so I am at least somewhat familiar with this field. I cannot think of a single (non-trivial) application where blockchain is better than using traditional systems. Data on the blockchain is permanent and public, which is not always desirable.

Let's say there's a Facebook clone using Blockchain. Somebody posts something terrible on my page, say some big secret about myself. I cannot have it removed because it is permanently in the blockchain.

Houston Texans Should Not Trade Watson This Year,"I don't think he should be traded unless the offer is considerably more than they think he is worth.  Most experts think he is worth 3 1st round picks and maybe more depending on the picks.  So unless they are offered much more they should hold on to him.

Right now both sides have similar power. It is a multi-million dollar game of chicken.  But as time goes on the team gains power IMO.  Here are the reasons to not trade.

1-He has a no trade clause.  And he is only willing to go a few teams. There are likely 20-25 teams or so that would be happy to have him, and around 15 that can afford him.  But he is only willing to go to 3-5 of those teams. So right now a handful of teams are willing to bid if you triple that number the odds of getting a better offer goes up.  Refusing to trade him may force him to drop the no trade completely or give a list of small teams he won't go to.  Ultimately increasing the number if teams that can make offers.

2-There is no rush, he is under contract for 5 more years, 3 guaranteed, so they won't lose him to free agency, and even if a team trades for.him.next year he is just as valuable since he will still have time left on his contract. Also next year there may be more teams capable of trading for him (Pittsburgh, New Orleans Tampa Bay).

3-They won't get the #1 pick and won't get Trevor Lawrence and a trade with Miami or Jets would likely get them a guy like Zach Wilson or Justin Fields most likely QBs of that caliber will be around next year. Guys like Tyler Shough or Sam Howell or Kedon Slovis are likely to be similar caliber next year.  And they sucked with Watson, so a top pick next year is likely.  

4-Precedent.  The NFL and Houston doesn't want this to turn into the NBA where you sign a guy then he looks to move on a year later because he is unhappy (Paul George).  Watson asked for guaranteed money and Houston gave it, he agreed to play for them for 5 years and 3 guaranteed.  They shouldn't easily give in. 

Watson will lose more if he sits out.  He will lose $15M this year, money he will never get back and a year of his career.  Houston knows their rebuild will take a few years so, getting extra picks starting this year or next and getting a new QB this year or next doesn't really change much.  

Unless the offer is considerably more than they think he is worth, there is little downside, with a decent upside of refusing to trade him.  The only exception I see is if Houston thinks Wilson or Fields is better than anyone they think they can get next year.",ldaipz,"The quarterback is the leader of the offense, and unless the Texans think they can smooth things over with him, trading Watson is absolutely the right move. There's nothing worse than having the team leader not want to be part of the team, and even if he doesn't show up and just go through the motions, the lingering effects of his attitude will infect the locker room.

So to address your points specifically. 

No trade clauses can always be waived by the player. If the Texans go to Watson and say ""We've been offered significant packages by X, Y, and Z teams, and those are the only places we can afford to send you,"" then Watson could very well decide he wants out badly enough to say fuck it and waive the clause. And truthfully, only a handful of teams would be willing to trade as many first round picks as would be necessary to acquire Watson, and he knows this.

There absolutely is a rush. If there's no chance of smoothing things over, then that totally screws the Texans for next season because they won't be able to draft a top QB this year, and without Watson they'll inevitably suck in this upcoming season. Free agents don't want to come to an organization with ongoing drama, and without the assets they would get from trading him, Watson is just dead money.

Getting the number one pick isn't important. There's a pretty large, and at least non-zero chance that Justin Fields winds up a better QB than Trevor Lawrence. I can't find it for some reason, but there's a graph out there somewhere that shows there are more solid QBs in the league right now that were not drafted with a top 5 pick than there are top five pick QBs. 

The NFL will never be like the NBA. I'm personally not a fan of the modern NBA free agency system, but ultimately an NFL team's success is dependent on too many factors to compare it to basketball, where one superstar has the leverage and talent to completely reshape the league if they change teams. And not to get too political, but if you want to follow this line of thinking, you need to think equally of Tom Brady going to Tampa, because otherwise your thinking less of a young black QB's desire to change teams than an older white QB doing almost the same thing (except obviously in free agency if I'm being fair). 

Truthfully, the Matt Stafford trade set a perfect precedent for the Texans to trade Watson. Watson is years younger and about equally as talented with higher potential, so the Texans would inevitably get a bigger package for him than the Lions got for Stafford. I think keeping a frustrated player around is the absolute wrong thing for the Texans to do, and since they're already trying to turn over a new leaf in the front office and with the coaching staff, it's probably worth it to start over at QB too.",gm5rj2s
All forms of monetary penalties should be based on the persons income,"For example: Why should I pay the same amount of money for speeding as another person who earns 10x more money, than I do.  

Isn't the whole reason for montery punishment, to make the person feel the impact of his/hers wrongdoing?  

But if a person, who earns 100k a month has to pay 300€ for a speeding ticket, do you really think that person cares at all?  

Someone who earns just 1k a month will no doubt feel the impact, paying a third of his salary for one illegal action.

Typically police only target extreme cases where one car is going much faster than others or is driving dangerous, but with income as a factor, they may see a reason to target luxury cars even if they are either not speeding, or are driving the same as everyone else on the road.",foykgq8
"""It's not what you know, it's who you know"" is largely misunderstood, and is not inherently a bad thing.","Usually, an employer/employee relationship is seen on reddit as pure application of Skills to Tasks. I know how to do X, employer needs X done, they pay me to do it. Based on that, it would seem that the only thing that should matter as to whether someone gets a job is ""what they know"" - how well they can do X.

But the truth is that the vast majority of jobs don't actually work like that.

When someone is given responsibility, they are also given trust. No matter how small or big that responsibility, the employer/client/whatever trusts the person to do the job well. By definition, in business, everyone is out for themselves - as they should be. No one should join a company and give hand their lives over to it. 

So we have a situation where Person A needs Person B to do something in exchange for payment, but Person B has different objectives. They want to get paid as much as possible for as little work as possible. Maybe they'll screw over Person A given the chance. Maybe they won't fit in with the rest of the team, leading to tensions and arguments and valuable time and resources being wasted in feuds.

This is where ""who you know"" comes in. If you know someone: 

\- First off there is some element of social contract there: they have a vested interest in honoring their task fairly because otherwise the repercussions may be social and severe.

\- You may have reassurances of their trustworthiness: either you or someone you trust has worked with them before, and can assure you of their ability to fulfill your objectives. It's not 100% sure. It's not a perfect guarantee in any way. But it's better than the unknown.

\- You may know whether they will fit in your company culture. I know the term is loathed, but it's true: I have seen people last 3 months in a role because while they were completely qualified they did not fit in culturally. 

All in all, if you have the choice between two perfectly qualified candidates, but one of them comes with those social guarantees, it is perfectly reasonable to choose them.

Of course, this can lead to discrimination, loss of opportunity, etc. So as a society, we want to discourage that. But on the individual level, it is perfectly reasonable to want to work with people you know.

Two States Policy is Dead for Israel and Hamas,"Majority of the Palestinians want to get the entire former land of Palestine back to the Palestinians, and get all their refugees back.

Majority of the Palestinians also reject the ""Two State"" solution.

They want the ""one"" state of Palestine re-instated.

What will happen to the 7 million Jews who are now in Israel is not clear under this demand.

Majority of the Israeli Jews , on the other hand, support annexing the entire land of former Palestine under Israeli rule, as a Jewish state.

Most Israelies now oppose the Two State Solution also, fully knowing that whatever little land they are leaving behind for Palestinians  is not at all viable for building a state.

What happens to the 7 million Palestinians inside such  a Jewish state, without democratic rights or equal protection of law is an inconvenient question that the Israelies are OK leaving unaswered for now.

As you can see, both the majorities from two sides are ignoring reality. 72 years is a long time and whatever happened during these seven decades, rightly or wrongly, are now reality, and they are here to stay. 

Seven decades of reality has consequences.

Neither of these two parties can simply ignore what happens to the other 7 million people for the long run, even when one feels that they are the victim of the other.

Ultimately the 7 + 7 million Jews and Palestinians will have to live side by side , as equal citizens  of either just One or Two states, with equal rights. 

It is most likely going to be just One state , where the Palestinians may not be able to live alone, but they will be the demographic majority.

a 0 to 4 GPA scale is a poor way to represent grades,"At a glace the current grade scale makes sense, anything under a 60 is considered not worthy of passing so we divide the passing region into four equally sized quadrants and make those the 4 passing grades. You then assign the quadrants a number from 1-4 and since an A is more valuable than a D it gets a higher number score and your total GPA is just the average of all numbers per credit. 

The problem comes from making the base zero occur at 59% rather than 0% on an exam. Going from a 60% to a 70% means you are going from a 1.0 to a 2.0 which means that a C is twice as valuable as a D despite being only a 10% difference in score. This is not an adequate reflection of the work necessary to obtain a C vs a D (or any other letter grade for that matter) 

While one could argue that by simply understanding how the grading scale works they'll understand that a D is not half as valuable as a C, that still does not mean that the method itself is flawed.",cjl9ww,"\&gt; While one could argue that by simply understanding how the grading scale  works they'll understand that a D is not half as valuable as a C, that  still does not mean that the method itself is flawed.

What the US did to Japan in WW2 was evil.,"Edit: Easily my quickest CMV ever. To me, it sounds as if this may have been a necessary evil to stop a greater evil. I don't think it was right what they did, but it may have been comparably the best option at the time. The best thing we can do now is look back at the past and learn from it. So that perhaps a situation as such wont ever happen again. We should never be forced to choose between necessary evils.

Dropping the atom bombs on Japan in WW2 resulted in the death of tens of thousands of innocent people, including women, children, and everyday people not even involved in the military. How they died was also sickening and terrifying, if you weren't killed by the initial explosion, you'd die of torturous radiation sickness, and other ways likewise. Attacking civilians should never be acceptable in war, at any cost. Japan, comparably, when they attacked Pearl Harbor, was attacking a naval base. The Japanese also did some terrible things to POWs in WW2 as well, so this definitely was not a good-guy bad-guy situation, as war often isn't. Both the Japanese and the US did evil things in this war.

Ignorance masqueraded as intelligence is best exemplified by those who falsely equate Communism with Nazism presenting them as flip sides of totalitarianism.,"Nazism whose central doctrine is the primacy of one group over another. Communism in its Marxist–Leninist persuasion seek to resolve class conflicts through a violent revolution against the Capitalist ruling class and dissolve class conflict through the equal distribution of resources by a dictatorship of the proletariat. 

First off, let me acknowledge both as terrible ideas. But they are fundamentally different. Nazism is by nature exclusive, if you are not born to a certain race and do not possess certain qualities that comes with birth, you are automatically placed on the antagonistic position. Communism as an end state seeks to embrace everyone, its group are structured by economic classification, stripping away that, it is an intellectual position that you can choose or choose not be a part of. 

There are other type of Communism, libertarian communism, anarcho communism possess none of the genetics of totalitarianism.

The issue I'm trying to describe here is connotation. If a certain idea, say communism, has never worked out in its intended way and always ended with a Stalin or a Mao, then why should the idea itself still be seen as its original version? It's clearly fiction, at that point. History changes how we view things, so saying ""but it is originally intended as"" is simply dishonest.",gharaai
There is nothing inherently better about Target than Walmart,"Something about the unequal way that people treat Target vs. Walmart has always bothered me immensely. People seem to have a reflexive distaste for Walmart but can't seem to go beyond the usual talking points, with varying degrees of truthfulness: Walmart underpays their employees and treats them poorly, they've driven local businesses away from small towns, their customer service is horrible, and their customers are low-class hillbillies.

This seemingly irrational dislike of Walmart bugs me so much, in fact, that for many years, I've gone out of my way to shop there over Target, even when a Target is a lot closer to me (and it usually is, because municipalities suffer from this same irrational hate and won't let Walmart put a store in their community while at the same time welcoming Target with open arms). For the record, I'm politically on the left, so people would probably pin me as a Target shopper if they didn't know me well.

What bothers me about Target is that they're put on a pedestal by the very people who hate Walmart, but these people can never provide a non-""classist"" reason why Target is any better. It's like they have to love Target more than they otherwise would so that they can absolve themselves of any personal guilt in shopping at a capitalist big-box store. Target fans will cite the store's more fashionable clothing selection or its higher-income customer base — but most of all, they'll cite the fact that it's not ""owned by the Waltons."" Target lovers can't point to anything positive about the store's corporate sustainability, or its treatment of employees, or any evidence of higher wages or better benefits than those of Walmart.

It bothers me even more that Target is so adept at marketing to these folks: the image the company puts out is one of being more urban, more fashionable, more suburban-female-friendly, more progressive, and more refined than its larger competitor. Target is much, much better at marketing itself than Walmart is. Walmart has been public-relations-challenged for decades, and to be fair, they \*are\* a bigger corporate giant.

For the record, I believe that both retail chains are equally bad — or equally not bad, however you want to look at it. Walmart may even arguably be more forward-thinking than Target in terms of its environmental sustainability initiatives, its role in serving urban ""food deserts,"" and sometimes even by being the only place to buy fresh food in economically-stagnant small towns. (Some people will argue that Walmart created these very conditions, but I think that's a gross oversimplification.)

Lastly, in terms of customer service, I've rarely had any negative experiences at any Walmart stores in the past 20 years or so — and I've been to dozens across the country. In contrast, I'm a longtime Costco member, and for a place that everyone touts as having good customer service, I've had a comparatively larger number of negative service experiences at Costco than at Walmart. You would think that with Costco paying their employees a living wage and giving them better hours, it would make them more pleasurable to deal with — but that hasn't been my experience at all.

**Change my view. Why should I hate Walmart but not Target? What makes Target inherently ""better"" than its larger competitor?**",jxhvnt,"Target is a better shopping experience than Walmart.

Their stores are generally cleaner, their overall product selection is of slightly better quality and from (admittedly anecdotal) experience shopping at Targets all over the US, the customer service is superior and checkout lines shorter and better managed.

I can also get a Starbucks coffee at Target to drink while I shop, and although overpriced and objectively not the best coffee in the world, it's better than what I can get on demand at Walmart.",gcwsd9z
"I support citizens owning guns, but I see no issues with some policies such as licences as something inherently wrong","Cars have licenses. Being a hair dresser requires licence. Owning a gun and having licence isn't necessarily 'oppressive'. I don't see anything wrong with that.

It is not unethical for Billionaires to exist,"I have seen a lot of anti-billionaire rhetoric on Reddit recently, and have consistently seen the point made that it is unethical for billionaires to exist, and that they are a failure of capitalism (or something along those lines).

While I accept that there are many billionaires who have made their money unethically, my contention is this: for many billionaires, they have made a wildly succesful product or service which does not rely on workers ""generating the wealth for them"", as some have argued. 

For example, J.K. Rowling is the first author to become a billionaire from writing Harry Potter. Notch created Minecraft pretty much singlehandedly and eventually sold it to Microsoft for upwards of a 2 billion dollars. In both of these cases, I can see no obvious signs of either of them being unethical or exploitative. Why should these people not get the money for the service/product they are selling? If Microsoft valued Minecraft at 2 billion, then is it not their right to pay for it, and Notch to receive the money?

I want to be clear that I think many billionaires are horrible people who have ridden on the backs of their workers to accrue their wealth, and many of them spend their money in greedy ways. However, this does not mean that all billionaires in general should not exist.

College is a better setting than high school for television shows.,"I'm in my late 20s and I've graduated high school and college and I would say that both were pivotal to me being the person I am currently.  However, when I look at pop culture aimed at younger people, it's 90% set in high school, with shows like *Riverdale*, *Euphoria*, *Vampire Diaries*, etc.  I think that college is a superior setting for these kinds of shows compared to high school and I'm very confused that Hollywood (movies or television) don't think to showcase this.  I'm probably missing something about college vs high school settings, so CMV!

**1) A higher level of competition.** A large part of high school stories revolve around a person finding what they're good at, their ""thing"", and using that to succeed in high school, but what happens when they go to college, especially a Big State U, and realize that they're middle of the pack in “their thing”? And that's whether it's athletics, cooking, musicianship, artistry, academics, or a hobby that you have.  It can be very disconcerting at first to think that you’re relatively unique for being an All-State student athlete, only to get to college and realize that there’s 20 in your cross-country team alone, and that you’re in the bottom half.  But it can also be wondrous to realize that you can be part of a passionate community in a way that you didn’t have in high school and use that higher level of competition to improve yourself and your work ethic.

**2) Who are you when no one is looking (or cares).** The biggest difference between college and high school is the lack of daily accountability enforced by parents or teachers.  Assuming the student is living on-campus while the parents are still at home, there’s no one to tell them that it's time to study or stop watching TV, and the professors more or less don't give a shit if one random person attends their class or not.  Some kids can't cope with the lack of structure and flunk out of school, when they were the top students at their high schools.  This is also the time where a lot of kids will for the first time have nearly unfettered access to drinking, drugs, and non-stop partying if they choose.  More than high school, college is where kids really experiment with the highs and pitfalls of drinking, drugs, hook-up culture, and partying.  What happens when a religious person gets to college, and gradually realizes that they don’t *really* believe in God, or at least not the God they were taught in their home?  How do they work through a loss in belief?

**3) Greater self-expression and more diverse interactions.**  This kind of intertwines with point #2, but I would argue that people are more likely to be weirder in college than high school because the greater anonymity of college allows them to try a different style of dress and personality without fear of damaging their reputation.  And if they do, it’s very easy to just find a new group of people to hang out with.  For a lot of kids, that might mean coming out as gay or trans, people exploring their sexuality, and getting into niche hobbies that simply weren’t available at their high school like boating or hiking.  There’s also the diversity of interactions that will occur.  Even a non-prestigious Big State U will have students from all over the world, and certainly all over the state it’s located in.  You’ll have people from all different experiences, socioeconomic backgrounds, rural, urban, suburban, and exurban communities all sharing classes and dorms together and exchanging worldviews.  Imo, the sheer diversity of people in college is far greater than you’ll find in a typical high school, no matter what you consider to be “diverse”.

**4) Meta Reasons.**  Basically, most of the actors playing high school teenagers, so commonly 14 – 18, are in their 20s and they look it.  They don’t look old, but they certainly look older than most teenagers and it can at times create a falseness to the narrative when I see a girl who’s clearly 20+ worried about passing algebra.  However, if you take the same group of actors and make them college students, then that age problem disappears.  Instead of a 20 year old worried about passing algebra, they’re worried about passing Organic Chemistry.  Additionally, the narrative feels much more authentic.  See *Skins UK* for better examples of how shooting a teen drama with actual teenagers makes everything more visceral.  Another aspect of high school dramas that gets addressed is the lack of parents.  Pretty much every teen show’s fandom will joke about how the parents will disappear for episodes at a time before reappearing for a scene or two before disappearing again.  If the show’s set in college, parental absence makes total narrative sense because it’s more likely that the students are living 40+ minutes away from their home.

**TLDR** These are the largest ways that I think college offers unique and superior story points to that of high school.  The combination of more adult-like freedom and apathy towards your behavior, a higher level of competition in all aspects, greater opportunities for self-expression and diverse interactions, all combined with the inexperience of youth.  As an added bonus, the actors are actually playing character their age, leading to more realism in these shows.",kin9bc,"Shows set in high school can follow multiple age groups. That includes the high school aged protagonists, their parents, the younger siblings who provide comic relief, etc. It's more relatable to a wider age group. College follows 18-22 year olds and no one else.",ggrv65a
The video games industry is becoming Hollywood when it comes to creativity,"With movies nowadays requiring $150 million plus to make, main stream movies are becoming fairly repetitive and risk free. More and more are becoming based on established IPs, remakes, reboots, sequels and prequels.

Sadly, video games are going down a similar path. AAA games are getting more expensive to make thus game studios are following the movie studio in avoiding risk, relying on established IPs...etc 

In both industries it seems only lower budget indie studios are taking risks and innovating their respective art forms. It seems the corporate mindset of maximizing profit and minimizing risk above all else is unavoidable.",v9bpao,"I suppose my argument can only be Indie games and films exist if you're willing to seek them out. 

You're absolutely right that the big game companies aren't looking to risk it all on a flashy new idea but rather are leaning on prior successes. Wherever you go formulas come out that just work. Most people can tell you the basics of a Jason Statham movie without watching it. 

The thing is why risk it? A Triple A game costs in the tens of millions to make. If you make a brand new innovative game and spend $100 000 000 (One hundred million) to make, test, produce and market, and you sell it at $60 a game, then you're gonna need to sell at least 1.6 million copies just to break even without a dollar of profit. In order to take that gamble you better be damn sure you can make that money back which means selling at volume. The reason an indie company can make that risk is that they aren't as cost intense. They know they are making a game for a 10 thousand to 100 thousand people at max. They can recoup that cash. Because i you can't recoup profit you go under.

Indie vs mainstream are two different games. Most gamers can pick up a mainstream title and get *some* enjoyment. But there are plenty of Indie titles that appeal to basically no one at all.",ibvl7b5
Collective Punishment is Inherently Unethical,"Basically, the title says it all. I believe that it is always wrong to punish innocent people for the behavior of others, just because those others happen to be in the same group (community, country, etc.) as them. 

This doesn't sound like a very controversial opinion, but I believe that people actually support collective punishment more often than they think. For example, you could look at economic sanctions. A lot of countries are hit by sanctions in an effort to influence their government. Usually, those governments deserve to be punished, but my problem with sanctions is that they essentially amount to punishing innocent citizens for the actions of their government. For example, you could look at some of the [disastrous effects that sanctions have on the lives of Iranian citizens.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_Iran#Humanitarian_impact) 

**What would probably** ***not*** **change my view**: Arguments that the overall benefits of collective punishment outweigh the overall harms. This is not a valid ethical argument. Even if torture was an effective way of getting criminals to confess (which it isn't), it shouldn't be used because it's cruel. 

**What might change my view:** A compelling argument for why collective punishment (or a specific form of it such as sanctions) is different from other forms of unethical punishments that are categorically denied (such as torture).

Change my view reddit!",e48t95,"In war, you can have 2 armies that fight and the winner takes the land or whatever and only soldiers suffer; however, one effective war tactic is guerilla warfare. When small groups of people perform terrorist acts or assassinate high ranking people or just ambush a group for heavy damage you have a unique problem to deal with. How do you combat guerilla warfare? Well, the most effective strategy is to attack something they care about which brings them out in the open OR sufficiently punishes them for their actions. They ambush your platoon, you kill their home town. They blow up your building, you kill their family.

Guerilla warfare is nearly impossible to combat unless you consider anyone that is harboring or supporting them to be the enemy. You have to kill ""the innocent"" to combat the threat. It's the only way to make your larger army a factor again.",f9bf4zz
"If being vegan were so great and natural, vegan food wouldn’t include mock meat, milk, cheeses and the like.","I understand that being vegan for religious or health reasons is absolutely a thing. However, a common track for vegans is about environmentalism and how humans were made to be vegan/vegetarian. If that were true, why are we so preoccupied with creating vegan versions of products that non-vegans eat? It’s not to be inclusive, since most non-vegans wouldn’t enjoy e.g. a vegan cheese. Doesn’t eating vegan versions of non-vegan foods just perpetuate the idea that veganism is less natural than the alternative, harder to maintain and on the fringes of society?",l4i7lp,"Veganism is generally touted for moral, environmental and health reasons, not taste. Everything you can eat while vegan you can also eat while not vegan, so obviously there’s an advantage there, but providing healthier mock foods that taste similar to non vegan foods you like doesn’t make the diet itself any less great from an ethical, environmental or health perspective, it may from a taste but that’s probably not by a large margin (especially if you use seasoning/sauces) and is very subjective. 

You seem to not understand why veganism is considered “great” by many, you mentioned environment yet you’re so fixated on something like taste which nobody ever argues, also what would you say to a vegan who just doesn’t like cheese/milk/meat? Is their diet less great because they don’t eat foods they don’t like regardless? Not everybody can eat or enjoy cheese or milk, and meat is kinda bleh unless it’s seasoned, but let’s say you like meat so much then at that point there are good substitutes that are very similar and healthier so I don’t see how that’s a downside to veganism. 

Chicken tastes kinda bland without seasoning, red meat is a carcinogen, and I can bet my life you barely know about great vegan dishes since they’re not super popular, but they exist.

Class action lawsuits only benefit lawyers and have no real consequences for the company being sued or solace for the victims.,"Take cell phone companies for instance. A lot of them have a line item that fluctuates every month ""miscellaneous fees"" that is pretty much literally there to account for fines or class action lawsuits. So the company gets sued, the lawfirm gets a million dollarsand a million customers all get a check for a $1.17 and then their phone bill goes up $2.34 the next month. Cycle repeats.

No-knock warrants should be allowed for very specific circumstances.,"I was discussing with my mother a local proposition that banned no-knock warrants. Personally, I think that no-knock warrants are overused and dangerous. I believe they create significant harm for marginalized groups, particularly black people. I also think what happened to Breonna Taylor was incredibly unjust. Basically, when it comes to drugs, and most crimes, they should be totally banned.

However, when it comes to kidnapping, human trafficking, or hostage situations, it appears to be a useful tool. A knock might alert a kidnapper that the police are here, to which they might murder the victim. I can see that the police driving up to their house might alert them anyway, but what if they aren't? Is there a situation where a no-knock warrant is the best course of action? Is allowing in these specific situations a net benefit?

I want to believe that there is no good reason for police to implement no-knock warrants, but is a total elimination putting victims of these situations more at risk?",uettg8,"Are we talking about the police force in it’s entirety?

Hitler would never have come to power if the German Monarch was kept on the throne after WWI.,"Thesis- In the German Empire, the monarch appointed the chancellor. There for there is no chance that the Emperor would have appointed Hitler because Hitler threatened his power.

Under the 1871 constitution of the German Empire, The Emperor appointed the Chancellor. So in the 1930s when Hitler was growing the Nazi Party there is not a chance in hell that the Emperor appoints him as Chancellor why?

1. He didn't have the majority in the parliament. So he couldn't use ""will of the people"" and thus this crazed man isn't getting the seat.

2. His personal power. He wouldn't appoint someone who would threaten his position. The Emperor had he stayed on the throne would have only wanted someone who would have gotten back the original territory lost during WWI. So likely chooses a more moderate person.

Stadiums build just for baseball games are the best venues to watch a live game . The other major professional sports games are much more pleasurable to watch at home on TV.,"Most ballparks offer fans a decent to a magnificent view. Meanwhile, the game itself is organized to be to give spectators a constant eye on the action. 

Not, all baseball stadiums are perfect; however, when you compare the same situation with other live sports, the experience is not the same. 

A football game is fun to enjoy the whole experience, tailgating then round, then hours of traffic exiting the stadium. The game itself is not played in a manner that gives all fans a clear view. 

The fans higher up in the seats might find it hard it see each play; therefore, purchasing seats mid-level 50-yard line is the best option but can be costly or only not available to non-season ticket holders or corporate members. It’s just not the most detailed view of the game, not to mention late-season games in cold wealth markets are somewhat unpleasant. 

Hockey is a game to see live just because TV doesn’t give fans a real idea of how fast the player is moving; live hockey games, especially when rivals are playing, the physical demands flying back and forth between pockets is fun, but like football, the ideal spots to sit and the view is similarity football. 

If you are deep-in nosebleed seats it’s hard to track tack activity. Most major market teams also cost a fair amount, given the number of games. Some hockey Arenas are build just to play hockey. The way the seats are designed, it’s almost pushed to the edge like you’re looking straight down.  Multi-use stadiums, basketball, hockey, and concerts are generally intended not to look down but out. 

Similar situations with basketball games that limit the view, college ball can be more entertaining. Meanwhile, the opportunity for most to have obstructed Views is common. 

Baseball stadiums are, without a doubt, genuinely designed for live outdoor viewing. Unlike other professional sports, baseball games on Tv can quickly become boring; even if the game is slow, the Atmosphere is fun.

Still, each experience is worth the travel. Some are best experienced at home to gain maximum attention and comfort.",ln8941,"You've obviously never sat behind a pillar at Fenway Park. I love baseball live, but there are issues with seating just like any sport.",go6u5po
america will never have affordable or moral healthcare,"***Why I hold my view***

Growing up in America, I've watched people endlessly talk about healthcare reform. About how it needs to change. About how this or that will solve the problem or how one country does something this way versus another. But then every bill or talking point is ignored or debated or shot down or just generally poorly thought out.

Because ultimately, no one *actually* cares about reaching a solution. Because every person dying or being put into life-ruining debt is not *that* important; or they are just being dramatic. The reason I believe it will never change is because the way our government works doesn't allow for it, and the kinds of political movements that would actually make a difference aren't possible.

The problem is really bad, and I feel terrible just existing in America because I feel complicit in what, to me, feels equivalent to socio-economic genocide. We are killing people, making good people kill people, and shaping children's views to recognize that money is required for you to be allowed to exist in any humanely defendable manner.

So I think it will never change because every step forward seems to be two steps back and people don't, to me, seem to take the situation as seriously as I'd like.

***What could change my mind***

For healthcare, what’s moral is healthcare producers having the “freedom” to produce the healthcare they think is best for the price they think is both best and consumers will choose to pay. And for healthcare consumers, what’s moral is having the “freedom” to consume the healthcare they think is best for the price they think is both best and producers will choose to accept. The alternative is the majority or their elected representatives or their expert forcing their values onto healthcare producers and consumers against what they think is best. 

In the US however, healthcare producers and consumers have their “freedom” violated in many, many ways through the FDA, Certificates of Need, Medicare/Medicaid, oodles of regulations etc., their freedom has been being increasingly violated over the decades and all signs is that the trend will continue. This has stopped Americans from having the best possible healthcare for themselves and created all of the problems as judged according to what’s moral. 

Whether or not Americans will ever have moral healthcare, produced and consumed under “freedom”, will ever have the highest possible quality healthcare for the best possible price, and an sector that improves those the best, depends on whether you think that doctors and patients will stand up for their “freedom” and persuade others to change the government to respect their freedom instead of increasingly violating it.",gky930a

Gender does not exist,"No, not that it's flawed, or that it shouldn't exist. I'm saying gender DOESN'T exist. There is nothing there. It isn't real, and any ideology based around the concept of gender is invalid and meaningless.


There's this idea that humans have both sex and gender - that people have their biological sex, and a gender identity of man or woman. I guess you're supposed to ""feel"" like a man or a woman? 


It's nonsense. Name one characteristic that isn't biological that all men have. You can't. It does not exist. Long hair? No. Dresses? No. There is not a single characteristic, culturally or personality wise, inherent to the male gender. Same thing the other way - some women have short hair and do traditionally male things. Gender roles are not based in reality.


 People are discriminated on based on their biological sex and pressured by society to do certain things, but people aren't born with a gender identity. It's something society tells them they should have based on their biological sex. There's nothing inherent to your biological sex that tells you  ""I am a woman and that means I do xyz."" Different cultures have different ideas of gender, and many people don't fit into the gender norms of their culture, proving that scientifically there isn't anything to back up the idea of a gender identity existing. It's made up.


The idea of a gender identity - that you identify with a certain gender - is bizarre to me. It's like being proud of your race - there isn't anything to identify with or be proud of. Gender, like race, is merely a physical characteristic of a person that does not reflect their personality in any way.


I don't care about my biological sex. There is no pride there. Anyone who is proud or ""euphoric"" of their gender is mentally ill. When transgender people try to chase the idea of gender euphoria, they chase a feeling that does not exist. I have nothing against them, they can do what they want, but ultimately you will never feel confident as a man or a woman.No one does. There is no identity to have there. It's just biology.


I kinda want my view changed because I'm in the clear minority here, and I'm interested in having this explained to me. But really, I don't think there's any science or reasoning behind the concept of gender.",gafmby,"I think I take issue with phrasing it as “non biological.”

Biological sex at birth does affect your bones, muscles, skin, organs and so on, so long as you are normally producing hormones at puberty. Why would the brain be a specific exception? In fact, we know it isn’t.

I agree that a lot of gender identity is cultural or impressed on children (still technically a function of biology) but it seems at least some of it is not. We may not know how much or which parts, but different brain patterns and functions do affect people’s motivations, and if there is some quantifiable difference between the average operation of a male brain and the average operation of a female then we could probably call that difference gender.",fozd21o
'Classical music' and the arguments that older music is 'better than today's trash' are problematic,"I often see arguments that 'classical music is better than shallow pop songs'. I think this is over-generalising things.

For one, when people mention the word classical music they mean long, drawn out orchestral music created by the highest acclaimed composers of an older age. It is unfair to compare these undeniably more complex forms of music to simple songs with lyrics. They are different mediums of music making.

Consider that even during the times of so called classical music most people were also more familiar with simple songs. Beethoven symphonies were not always the most common form of entertainment. Rather, it was more likely people learned songs that were created by song writers similar to modern pop songs.

Basically songs are the most common type of music generally speaking in terms of a music intended for entertainment and not for religious, political, or military uses. It is so even during mozarts time.

The so called classical music people like to venerate is infact a modern construct. It is a conglomeration of all the best most complex music created that withstood time.

If we follow typical vegan thinking then we should just stop having kids.,"Yes, this will make me sound like Thanos.

My understanding, obtained from reading reddit posts, is that vegans believe that we should stop animals being bred specifically to be exploited for meat or their materials. This should be done because they experience unnecessary pain in these processes. These animals have been reared solely for the purpose of being exploited, so if we stop these industries then there will be no incentive for these animals to be reared and they will never exist. Basically it is better for most of the animals that exist today to have never existed rather than experience unnecessary pain. Likewise it is impossible for us to completely eliminate all possible human pain in the future of humanity, thus it is better if future humans were not to exist. So we should all not make kids.",di8v0j,"Daamn man baby steps, please...

"US school districts should stop doing standardized tests, even without larger legislation","K-12 Schools should simply stop performing standardized testing when able, even at the loss of funding from their state. At the state level, school boards and local/municipal districts/school boards, or whatever they might be called, might not be able to make this decision at all, but when possible would be better to ignore standardized testing even at the cost of funding.

**Federal funding** \- I had been operating under the assumption that non-compliance with standardized testing would lead to a reduction in federal funding, but this might not actually be the case. Given reasonable complaints about standardized testing and federal overreach on education, if they are unable to do anything or much to punish a school for non-compliance, then this is irrelevant.

**State funding** \- Many school districts might find that states would be willing to grant waivers in cases where a district decides not to perform them. Furthermore, from my personal experience in the classroom, very large amounts of class time were literally wasted trying to get underperforming students to a passing level.

So, if budgets would have to be cut, it might not actually lead to lower performance due to inherent weaknesses of teaching to standardized testing. For example, a school might reduce the absolute amount of class time while still having an equivalent amount of actual instruction.

**Compensation from budget shortfalls -** Remaining school time could be handled with lower paid tutors or childcare professionals, or made up with private instruction for students whose parents could afford it. This might even create opportunities for a district to make up funds by renting out classrooms to private instructors, or by reducing the absolute amount of class time, give extra instruction to students who need extra help and allow high-performing students more independent study.

My first thought as to how to change my view would be to show that, from a cost/benefit perspective, this doesn't add up generally.

**Edit:** Through this discussion, I've realized standardized testing isn't likely the cause of the largest issues, and that schools could already do many of things that would be better already, but don't, and even if standardized tests aren't very useful, the alternatives are so implausible that they could very well be *poor* but also the *best.*",nxkn2n," I disagree with this take. 

Though there are natural flaws with standardized testing, the practice gives us an objective way to comprehend which students understand a topic in a general sense in comparison to those who need more assistance/time to understand a subject. If we take this away, grades become subjective. This means they have no real validity. 
 
If a teacher was to simply judge which student has more general knowledge over another with no objectivity involved, it opens the door for numerous problems. One of these potential problems include biasness; A teacher could give a better score to one student for no inherent reason besides personal preference. Nonetheless, even if biasness wasn't a problem to be feared, it would create miscalculation of scores and accusations of biasness. 

Should standardized testing be reformed? Sure. However, it should never be halted in it's entirety.",h1fe3bd

We can not hold all slave traders before the 18th century to the same moral standards that we have today,"I guess this is an unpopular opinion, but while I understand that statues while perhaps made for historical purposes can have different modern interpretations, and that thus gives people the right to remove them, I don't necessarily agree that all slave traders were all bad people. I know this is a really weird thing to be fussing about, and I'd like to point out that I fully support the Black Lives Matter movement, but I can't help but feel that we are all products of our environments. Take for example, a random dude born in the 1700's to a family of slave traders. This dude is a product of his environment and will not have moral standards that we do in the modern age. In fact, he might actually believe that what he's doing is moral as some people did back them. I understand that slavery is intrinsically bad but that's only because we've discussed the topic as a society and unanimously agreed that it's evil, the majority of slave traders back then probably didn't have the same discussion and didn't hold such preconceptions. I'm not trying to say what they did was right: I'm simply trying to say that we can not judge people from before the 18th century by holding them to the same moral standards we have today.

I support changing our senators pay and benefits.,"I have done some research into the a senators job discription and here are some things I've learned that anyone can find:

*Senators are paid $175,00/year AFTER benefits including:
     - full coverage for Healthcare (totally reasonable, but
       why can't everybody have that?)
     - pension FOR LIFE after 5 years of service
     - allowances AFTER their yearly income
*Senators are contractually obligated to work ONLY 128 days/year

If there are 535 senators all earning $175,000 annually that's roughly $90 million/year. Now, to put that in perspective, assuming they were to only work on that schedule doing 8hr days like most Americans they would be making roughly $117/hr. earning a years worth of pay in 1/3 of the time compared to the average American.

So, while 13 million people work year-round for $20,000 earning below $13/hr with no vacation time barely able to afford the basic necessities like food, water, clothing, shelter, and others that are pretty much just as needed to survive in modern society like vehicles, car insurance, health insurance, internet, school, etc.

We could be paying them $50,000/year, which is more than enough even for a family of 5 while saving taxpayers $60 million to put somewhere more important like subsidies to scientific or medical research institutions, pay people in an effort to aid cities like Flint, Michigan who are STILL without clean water, or even to incentivise companies to go green. Obviously it will not happen all at once, but I feel we could be using this money elsewhere, and if we're wasting that much, how much else are not benefitting society?

Is that not socialism for the rich, paid for by the poor?
Would you support cutting out senators benefits? Why or why not?",m27q7m,"Let's flip this around to look at more local elections.

Very often, state representatives or senators are paid very little. They also often have sessions that last for two months to half a year, which effectively renders them incapable of holding any traditional, career oriented job. For a random example, Texas pays delegates around $7200/year and has a legislative session length of around 140 days. This is so low, with a legislative session length so long, that it is basically impossible for anybody who does not have a secondary income source to become a legislator. So, naturally, people who wind up involved in state politics tend to be business owners or others who can maintain their income while committing half a year to legislative sessions, rather than e.g. working-class people who would need to torpedo their career or constantly job-hop to meet the demands of the legislative session. That is a negative outcome that could be avoided by paying legislators well so that they did not need to have existing business relationships to get involved in politics.",gqhvpea
"There is absolutely nothing wrong with urinating in the sink, and everyone who claims to be environmentally conscious should be doing it.","I'm serious. I've been (almost always) pissing in the sink for the better part of a year now and I can't help but feel proud about how much water I've saved. Here's my reasoning as to why everyone should piss in the sink:

1)*First and most importantly, it saves water*. The average toilet uses about six litres of water per flush. Pissing in the sink easily saves at least five and a half unless for some reason you use ridiculous amounts of water for washing your hands. In short, pissing in the sink saves water, nature' most vital resource.

2)Sometimes, especially if you've had a bit too much to drink, the simple act of trying to hover over a toilet (if you're male) and accurately piss into it is too far beyond your capabilities. Pissing into a sink solves this problem.

3)Most bathroom sinks are about crotch high, which makes it perfect for this.

4)What do people find so disgusting about it anyway? After you've pissed in the sink, the soapy water that you use to wash your hands will wash away the urine and help to clean the sink's sides.
And if I'm not mistaken, urine is sterile anyway, so what difference does it make?

5)Ever noticed how usually when you enter a bathroom, you're almost always closer to the sink than the toilet? This one is self-explanatory.

I firmly believe that everyone, especially people who live one, or only with members of the same sex as them, should take full advantage of this brilliant life hack. Try to convince me otherwise.",ergfba,"First and foremost, urine is not sterile. It may be sterile before leaving your bladder (unlikely, as bacteria exists everywhere in the human body, although it's not always bad bacteria either), but it is not sterile once it has traversed your remaining urinary tract. This alone is a good argument for keeping urine separate from spaces that you use more frequently.

Second, the cleanup required after each urination in the sink (both the sink itself, as well as the tap, mirror, and vanity) would likely negate the water savings. An average new sink uses around 7.5 litres per minute, older sinks uses up 18 litres per minute. Hand washing, without worrying about the sink cleanliness, should take 30 seconds. Best practices include turning off the water while you are washing your hands, but if you must first clean it, then your cleanliness is at issue.

If you miss the toilet while drunk, sit down.",ff3sc2e
It's understandable to not want to date obese people purely because they're obese.,"Now I should explain: I'm assuming most people don't want to date obese people for preference reasons, however there are actually good reasons not to, such as: 

Non vanity related physical issues, such as differences in lifestyle and distribution of work in the house, long term health, etc. 
As well as:

 the reason they're obese in the first place. Now, let's assume you're looking to date people based on looking for long term relationships. If they're obese because of thyroid issue or other genetic issue, that wouldn't be good if you were looking to have children.

As well as: if it's obesity gained from emotional issues (such as SO dumping you making you feel unloved so you fill that hole with like ice cream or somethong) it's possible that they're not over them yet (possible not definite), so that could cause some unnecessary nonsense you won't be ready or willing to deal with. 

And possibly the worst one: lack of urge control. If the person's obese because they are unable to control their urges, that's not a good thing for a LTR. You were saving up for a vacation? Well you were, except that money has been spent on a new sports car, and now you're in debt.

Now I should clarify: I don't hate overweight people or anything, I just think it's justified to not be villified for not wanting to date them for reasonable reasons. 
That being said I'm willing to change my view so... Have at it.
Edit: so far I've seen a fair amount of good points, but none have changed my view yet",lrp4sm,"You're saying that it's understandable for non obese people to not date obese people. Your arguments doesn't apply if you're already obese because you have the lifestyle and short life span described by you so you can't use that as a reason to not want to date someone like you. 

Your arguments are fair but I still don't think they can beat the fact that it's harder to be physically attracted by someone with obesity. You're just finding extra arguments to justify that. 

There are a couple of standards that are common among us which stimulates our brains. Like how we look for symmetrical faces. This is on a general note. 

We all know the example with Mauritania where girls are forced to gain weight in order to be considered attractive but they're still not highly obese. Our standards might deviate a little but they're far away from having obesity as a beauty standard. We have to admit that even if it doesn't sound good.",gos2m8w
"If employers expect a two week notice when employees quit, they should give the same courtesy in return when firing someone.","I’ll start off by saying I don’t mean this for major situations where someone needs to be let go right away. If someone is stealing, obviously you don’t need to give them a two week notice. 
 
So to my point. 

They always say how it’s the “professional” thing to do and you “don’t want to burn bridges” when leaving a job. They say you should give the two week notice and leave on good terms. Or that you should be as honest with your employers and give as much heads up as possible, so they can properly prepare for your replacement. I know people who’s employers have even asked for more than the two weeks so that they can train someone new. 

While I don’t disagree with many of this, and do think it is the professional thing to do, I think there is some hypocrisy with this. 

1) Your employers needs time to prepare for your departure. But if they want to let you go they can fire you on the spot, leaving you scrambling for a job. 

2) The employer can ask you to stay a bit longer if possible to train someone, but you don’t really get the chance to ask for a courtesy two weeks. 

3) It puts the importance of a company over the employee. It’s saying that employee should be held to a higher standard than an employer. As an employee you should be looking out for the better of this company, and be a “team player”. 

Sometimes there are situations where giving a two week notice isn’t needed. If you have a terrible employer who you don’t think treats you fairly, why do you need the two week notice? If you feel unappreciated and disrespected, why is it rude to not give a notice? 

If that’s the case then why do people not say the same about employers firing people with no notice? How come that’s not rude and unprofessional? Why is that seen as a business move, but giving no notice of quitting is seen as unprofessional? 

If we’re holding employees to a standard, we should hold companies to the same standards. 


EDIT: Thank you for all the responses, I didn't think this would get this large. Clearly, I can't respond to 800 plus comments. I understand everyone's comments regarding safety and that's a valid point. Just to be clear I am not in favor of terminating an employee that you think will cause harm, and giving them two weeks to continue working. I think a severance is fair, as others have mentioned it is how it is in their country. However I agree with the safety issue and why you wouldn't give the notice.

Philosophy education should be mandatory curriculum in high school.,"Let's start by clarifying the minimum condition that I am arguing for.

**Why philosophy is important to everyone, not just philosophers**: virtually every aspect of our lives, no matter who or where you are, is intimately altered by the various structures of power and decision making surrounding us whether that be governments and laws, corporate policies, or the decisions ordinary individuals make on a daily basis.

You can hardly name a political issue that doesn't invoke strong if not intense fundamental moral disagreements. The world has been in a state of strife regarding capitalist institutions for as long as they have existed. There remains a massive division in attitudes toward interpersonal relationships regarding things like sexuality and race which at their most extreme have led to regular acts of violence and terrorism. The connective tissue between all of this is that we have these wildly inconsistent and disoriented world-views that constantly clash because of their incompatibility but philosophy promises us the possibility of a solution. Philosophy suggests that there is an identifiable truth that could correct and align these entanglements, that we could work through a system of logical and critical thinking to find resolution and peace through a coherent and discoverable truth to these polarizing questions. In short, I argue that every one of us basically understands that ethics and morality are indispensable foundations to human living and that the skill set of being able to critically evaluate these things is likewise important. It follows then that we should be extremely interested in making sure all citizens have a basic, working understanding of philosophy so that they have the tools to navigate the moral decisions they make throughout their lives at the individual level, the international and political level, and everywhere between.

Finally, I want to briefly summarize the structure of philosophy and make it clear why it is needed in its entirety and not *just* the ethics component. If we start by defining philosophy as the discipline of trying to identify and make coherent the most fundamental truths of life and the universe, what should become evident is a certain structure or flow of logic from the starting point to the finish. The most fundamental set of questions that must be answered are those of ""what makes things true?"" and ""what is knowledge? how do we come to know something rather than merely believe it?"". This is the branch of *epistemology*. It follows that we cannot exactly determine ethical truths if we haven' t even defined what truth is in the first place. Next we deal with questions of *metaphysics* that all stem from the question ""what is real?"". It does us little good to attempt to reconcile moral disagreements if we don't agree about the nature of reality. Do we have free will? Does a god exist who makes demands of us? Do ""rights"" actually exist in some sense or did we just make them up? All of these are metaphysical questions that need to be answered before we can find answers about morality. After our predicates of knowledge and reality are established we can start asking questions of ""what is right and wrong?"", or *ethics*, and using this come to agreements over how to approach government, laws, and international relations. This is philosophy in a nutshell and we need all of it, not just ethics, to make coherent and consistent decisions.

To conclude, I believe fully that highschool juniors or seniors would be fully capable of and immeasurably benefited by philosophical education. It would create the conditions we need for our society to escape this environment of perpetual strife, confusion, polarization, and manipulation that is the beating heart of most or even all of our current problems as a species.

Edit: Just want to say before I forget: thanks to everyone for the engagement. I'm very pleasantly surprised by how much feedback and respectful debate I've seen. I'm pretty new to Reddit (my account is a year old but I've only actually been active for the last month or two) so I don't quite understand the awards or what they do or signify, but I always see people thanking others for them so they must be at least somewhat meaningful, so thank you for those too!",ntv0g1,"I've never had a useful lesson in philosophy that was worth remembering or somehow thought provoking, or not teaching a blatantly obvious point. I feel the field of philosophy is about putting sometimes complex (sometimes simple) ideas into more complex and overly lengthy texts. 

I went on to have a successful life (so far). Thus negating the concept that philosophy is a necessary subject matter in my life. Other than the field of philosophy itself I do not see the need for anyone to have a basic understanding of philosophy in order to function well. 

I have no personal evidence that philosophy would add to my productiveness as a contributor to society. Nor do I have any evidence that philosophy has enriched my life. 

Most of the important questions you pose in your post are actually not important, or often they are more properly treated in physics or math, sociology or any other subject matter. I am also not sure that philosophers are in a better position to properly discuss ethics, over say, kindergarten teachers. 

I feel you mistake your passion for necessity. The field of philosophy seems to over exegerate its importance as most fields do, but here it is quite extreme. Philosophy is just as necessary as music or religion, it exists to entertain people.",h0w8f2i
Religion has done more harm than it ever has good.,"So many bad things are done in the name of religion.
The good things that are done in the name of religion would probably have been done anyway.

The positives of religion I see is that it can form a bond between people, a community where people get together to help each other. However this is done in such an unhealthy way where said community has to follow a set of rules normally designed by religious leaders who have lots to gain from these rules. The money that religions take from the community is vastly more than they give back. The biggest example being the Catholic church who own their won country!

Coming from the UK where religion is accepted but never really promoted I can't really see the difference between someone claiming there is a God to an antivaxxer or someone who uses rocks to try and cure themselves.

What about religion am I missing and why are some people so ""into"" it without being able to see they are being exploited?

EDIT: Thanks for the replies. I've had my view changed a bit and added a delta to some of the useful replies. The main point I've realised is that religion and society, for a long time in history have been so closely linked as to essentially be the same thing. Religious organisations have contributed to the advancement of mankind across the world for millennia. 
It's still my belief that certain parts of a lot of religions are holding us back at the moment, but to say it has done more harm than good over the course of history is impossible to quantify so I'll give you the benefit of doubt.
Thanks the to the people on here who have pointed out some of the good things their organisations have done. I still don't think that you need to believe in a God to do good things or be a good person, but there are definitely good religious people out there.",fzxsfq,"1.

"As an african american girl, I am very well open to dating outside of my race, but I find that if I were to date a conservative, I should be ashamed of myself.","I desperately need to hear someone else’s point of view. so first off, and this isn’t the same for all black families, but for a lot of us, we were conditioned to think that conservative = racist. i’m only 18 so i haven’t been alive for a long time but the older i get and the more racism i see that was once hidden from me as a child, the more terrified i am on dating someone conservative. And to be honest, I say i’m scared of dating a conservative because a lot (not all) voted for Trump. Trump’s character makes me feel extremely uneasy and a lot of his supporters as well. If this was the year 2000 and I fell in love with a guy who voted for George Bush, I’d be okay with it. GB seems like a very nice guy, in my opinion. But there’s so many stereotypes of Trump supporters or “conservatives” that I have to turn down a lot of guys who are interested in me because of this even though they are very nice. I was actually best friends with a Trump supporter in high school but she betrayed me and almost ruined my life. So, it could be stemming from those experiences because her supporting him annoyed me, but at that time, I wouldn’t break my friendship with her. My now, with everything that was happened in this country and me seeing it for myself, I feel very uneasy about it. As of now, I only have one Trump supporter in my life but he doesn’t talk about it a lot and it’s only for virtual hookup purposes. Change my views of me being ashamed to date a conservative or Trump supporter.

Half your age plus 7 is a bad system for dating and the threshold for social acceptableness should be higher.,"By this rule of thumb, a 19 year old should be fine with dating a 16 year old, even though in my eyes that situation is socially taboo and quite predatorial. A 16 year old is halfway through highschool, below the age of consent in most states, while the 19 year old is much more emotionally mature. At higher ages it is creepy too, should 40 year old men be dating 27 year old women, fresh out of college? Of course they are consenting but it still looks weird. At very high ages like 70 to 80, it gets ridiculous. I'm not exactly sure a better system, but I think this common rule is unreasonable.

Apple Music is absolutely terrible in comparison to Spotify.,"So recently, my Spotify premium subscription ran out so I decided to start using Apple Music since it came free with my Verizon account. Anyways, wow Apple Music is bad. I can't believe it is a byproduct of Apple. I am utterly disappointed. Here is a list of why.

CONS
---
- no option to personalize/alter EQ
- app often freezes, having to restart it
- can not organize songs in playlist automatically (""by artist"", ""by recently added"", etc.)
- can not search for songs within a playlist
- the whole ""library"" feature is unnecessary and weird
- lack of artist pages
- lack of a ""friends live listening feed""
- slow song downloading
- few seconds of silence before every song
- no audio normalization so each song has a drastically different audio level having to constantly adjust it to every song
- confusing layout
- too many options in search, ""search in artist"", ""search in albums"", ""search in songs,"" etc. Should be just a general search like Spotify lol
- bad discover playlists/radio stations
- no option to chose the quality of music streaming
- no option to chose the quality of music downloaded
- lack of genius incorporation (Spotify includes)
- lack of canvas looping visuals on tracks (Spotify includes)
- no personalization options (night mode, cross fade, etc.)
- slow, messy animations with no option to remove
- lack of ""date added"" on songs within playlists
- no sound when skipping or pausing a song, making it unknown if the song is actually paused or the app has again, crashed
- no refresh option without closing out of the app
- slow loading when switching pages
- after hour of inactivity, music shuts off
- no option to delete cache
- more song uploads on Spotify
- no collaborative playlist option
- non-original logo
- lot of glitches!! It keeps closing me out even when typing this
- no personal connection with app (this is a weird one but Spotify will recommend underrated songs, make you weekly playlists, tell you which songs you should add to your playlist, yearly updates, etc.)
- includes many 3D Touch features but not every iPhone includes the 3D Touch function
- slow maneuver around the app
- no function to skip song by sliding cover, you have to press the skip button (small features like this make Spotify amazing)
- to open a shared song through Apple Music is unachievable without a premium Apple Music account, making sharing music very hard unless both parties have Apple Music. (With a free Spotify account, Spotify will share a preview of the song or play the full song if you haven't used all of the skips)
- no free version of the app at all
- almost 75% less users than Spotify (Apple- 60m users, Spotify-228m)
- doesn't tell you if you add a duplicate to a playlist
- starts playing whenever you plug your phone into an aux or usb connected to a device and can be the most annoying thing 

PROS
---
- free with Verizon
- lot of free trial options
- personal profile like a social media account
- lyrics provided under the song
- song cover picture next to title in playlists
- ability to change username
- volume slide bar within app
- aesthetic follower and following lists",dtnita,"I personally use apple music because I have tried Spotify and couldn't handle the way it organises your music. Or at least the way it used to (I realise it doesn't do that anymore). 

It used to be that when you click on ""artists"" then select and artist it would just bring you to an alphabetical list of their songs. If you have a lot of songs by this artist it just doesn't work well. On Apple music, if you select and artist it shows you their albums and you can then select the desired album then the desired song. It seems on Spotify now it brings you to the artists page which has a lot of stuff on it which I think is kind of inefficient. It would be easier if it would just take you to their albums. I find the way it's organised on Apple music much more efficient. 

There are some cool features on Spotify but none of which I think are essential or that big of a deal. And some of the issues you state I have not personal experience. For example I do not find that some songs are louder than others. And the few seconds of silence before each song is only true if youre streaming and your connection is slow. And there most certainly are artists pages you just have to search for them using the search tool. 

Your comments about the layout being confusing are kind of invalid. The layout is confusing because you're not used to it. There is nothing especially confusing about the layout of apple music you just have to get the hang of it. 

Also ""non original logo"" you're really scraping the bottom of the barrel there mate lol.

Medicare-for-all is a bad idea for the United States,"Let me preface this by saying that I supported Bernie Sanders in 2016. I thought M4A/single-payer was an excellent idea back then. As I’ve become more informed, my stance on the issue has changed. I simply don’t see how we can implement a single-payer system without absurd costs to the federal government and a reduction in quality. Additionally, I am concerned about a lack of competition in the industry and salary reductions. I understand the moral aspect of ensuring that everyone is covered, and I agree with the spirit of M4A. I simply don’t see how it could be implemented in an affordable manner that wouldn’t decrease the quality/efficiency of health care.

I much prefer plans of a public option or other systems that allow private insurance to coexist with the public coverage, such as Andrew Yang’s plan.",enqpfj,"\&gt; I simply don’t see how it could be implemented in an affordable manner that wouldn’t decrease the quality/efficiency of health care.   


So, full disclosure, I don't actually know the numbers on this in terms of exactly how much people currently spend, how much the US spends, costs per capita, average costs, etc.  However, I do work in healthcare, so let me offer some perspective on our current system vs. medicare for all vs. a public option  


I think you totally overestimate how much competition currently exists in our health care market.  Competition really only exists in the healthcare industry for insurance companies, drug manufacturers, and medical supply/materials companies.  Currently, our costs are super high in all of these areas because states are limited in their ability to negotiate lower prices on drugs, and insurance companies have virtually all the power when it comes to determining rates for insurance (they have to follow regulations and there are some price controls and subsidies, etc. in place, though).  There's also very little competition between hospitals when it comes to where people go for a lot of their care, because the factors that people base their choice of hospital on are generally not as dependent on quality of care or cost as we'd like (it's frequently based on proximity, specialty, wait time, and whether or not their insurance would actually cover their care).    


So in a way, I think there are some areas where a medicare for all plan would actually increase competitiveness, in that drugs companies and medical suppliers would have to compete in a wider market, which would give more leverage in negotiations to providers or the government and enable them to bring prices down.  It would likely take quite a bit of burden off employers if they didn't have to offer insurance plans to their employees.  It would also allow people more freedom to choose hospitals that they want to go to, which would increase competition in that regard.    


Plus, people can now take the money they were spending on private insurance and pay that to a single pool.  We can then get rid of a lot of the incredibly byzantine infrastructure dedicated to fighting insurance companies for coverage, too, which creates a lot of increased cost.    


It's not a perfect system by any stretch of the imagination, and I share your concern for quality of care (in some ways) and salary reductions.  But I think it's possible to design a system that mitigates those issues while receiving more of the benefits a medicare for all plan would bring.",fe3uch3
"If it's okay for some people to believe in God, then it's okay for other people to believe in ghosts, werewolves and vampires.","There's no objective proof for the existence any of these: God, ghosts, werewolves or vampires.

In [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/irn6j5/aita_for_being_mad_that_my_husband_let_us_buy_a/) post on AITA, people are calling OP crazy for believing in ghosts. And yet, if people hadn't been believing in god(s) for many centuries and suddenly today some dude started talking about an all-powerful being who created the universe, they'd be laughed out of the room.

Personally, I don't believe in the existence of any of those. But if God can exist without us having any proof of their existence, why can't all sorts of other magical creatures? Logically, why is it okay for us to ~~make fun of someone~~ _consider someone crazy_ for believing in ghosts (and other supernatural creatures), but not for believing in God (edit: and angels?), other than the fact that the existence of God has been normalized in society over several centuries?

Saying problems in the United States are caused by “socialism” is to contradictory to be said or accepted in good faith.,"The United States has spent so many resources and so much manpower on stopping the proliferation of socialism, even to the point of overthrowing democracies, the country seemingly prides itself on being the bane of socialism.
Any seemingly dystopic trends in our country can’t in good faith be blamed on a “socialist” like Joe Biden or Clinton getting a bee in their bonnet.  
Our country has spent a good deal of its own existence finding the track it has ridden to today.  It’s the product of civil war and revolution, democratic republicanism yet bigotry.  We have made sure to stop the founding of socialist governments in our hemisphere whenever we’ve got the chance, even at the cost of democracies and the quality of the lives of millions.
Socialist government isn’t the reason your kids are starving and being arrested.  It isn’t the reason so many don’t have food on their table today.  It isn’t the reason so many are getting incarcerated or shot.  It isn’t the reason you’re without heat and power in a blizzard’s aftermath.

"We (The West) are yet to find an effective replacement for the church, at providing existential meaning and inclusive community","A bit of housekeeping to start:

* Whether or not Christianity is true is irrelevant to this discussion. It is the utility of belief that is the point of debate. So if your main criticism is that God doesn't exist, you have missed the point.

* By ""the church"" I refer to the collective noun for members of Christianity, not the physical buildings.

* By ""inclusive"", I mean that anyone *can* become a member. Canonically, no-one is beyond salvation.

* I specify Christianity as opposed to religion in general, because Christianity has moulded into Western culture in a way that no other religion really has, giving it a unique cultural/existential cross-over.

* I can only talk about the West, because it's the only culture I have anything more than a passing interaction with.

The secularisation of the west was not, in itself, a bad thing. However, we have over-corrected to a point of nihilism. Nothing has ultimate reason, there is no grand narrative. I think this is damaging to the human psyche. Humans are the meaning seeking animal. That's what Science is about, ""what's the purpose of birds flying away during winter?"", it is finding the purpose/reason of events in nature. This ran alongside searching for existential meaning, for which a belief in an afterlife is at the very least *useful*. It is not surprising now that people are more willing to just look out for themselves, do what's best for them, given that the overarching cultural opinion is ""these ~90 years are all you've got, then nothing eternal"". Nihilism is the logical conclusion of such a premise.

The church provides a community in which anyone *can* belong. Unlike other groups created as an attempt to replace it, there is no contingent requirements. The nation, the race, identity politics, all require some innate requirement for one to belong. They are not open to anyone. To put it another way, the church is intersectional. The rise in male driven white nationalism is not all that surprising, giving that white males are pretty much denied any attempt to unite under their common identity. That generates resentment, and counter movements. All around them people gather under their collective identities (women, LGBT+, BAME, etc.), but they are denied this. Combined with the existential angst generated by life's intrinsic meaningless, this causes problems. Alternatives to religion also do not provide an imperative to act kindly towards all others, the church does\*. Love thy neighbour, care for the stranger, love the enemy, are all scripturally mandated by the Bible. Some alternatives expressly push for the opposite, nationalism and racism in particular. 

In summary, the church provides a sense of belonging to anyone, as well as a meaning to life, providing a community from which one can access support from others and a basis from which to develop individual identity, without losing collective belonging.

\* Yes, there are people within Christianity who do not act in this manner, but that is in spite of the moral teachings of Jesus, not because of them.

"Aspects of capitalism (consumerism, geek/nerd culture, pop culture, fandoms) are weirdly religious in nature, and may even be trying to replace religion","Religion is often defined as the belief and worship of a superhuman power, such as God. But religion can also be defined as a system of faith and worship, which is what I’ll be focusing on here.

I would argue that capitalism, in tandem with the rise of secularism, is now attempting to co-opt religion for the benefit of corporations and the elite. Consumerism, geek culture, and fandom/stan culture are all ways to turn the support of corporations into worship.

A simple example is a Disney adult. I enjoy Disney films but a substantial number of adults in America are obsessed with Disney characters and media to an unhealthy agree. They spend thousands to go to Disneyworld/Disneyland annually and spend hundreds on both Disney products and merchandise throughout the year. In this scenario, the leader of the Church/temple is the Disney corporation, the Church/temple is Disneyworld/Disneyland, and the merchandise/products are like objects of worship.

Another similar example is geek/nerd culture. Many geeks obsessively spend hundreds of dollars a year on collectibles (i.e. objects of worship) and movies/novels/games/anime/shows/comics (i.e. scripture).

With people spending their time and money this way, numerous characters from these corporations have become so iconic that they have *almost* formed mythologies of their own, like characters from Disney, Pixar, Fox, WB, Star Wars, Marvel, DC, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, etc. I say almost because most people do not believe these characters to be real, unlike most mythology. Nevertheless, there’s no denying the influence of these characters. They are considered global icons and are now part of a worldwide shared context. In this sense, pop culture, which is controlled almost entirely by corporations, is now sort of a mythology on its own.

Fandom/stan culture is my final example. From sports to music to film, people are now tying their identities to fandoms and to the celebrities they “stan” in much the same way as they would tie their identity to their religion. Celebrities are even called idols sometimes because of the love and reverence they are given. This is all a product of capitalism. 

I’m not saying you can’t be religious and a fan of Star Wars or Messi or Ariana Grande, but I feel that many irreligious people have unknowingly adopted consumerism/capitalism as religion, which is unhealthy.",v8odn7,"Religion conferred strong advantages among early human societies because they fostered trust among fellow believers, and they promoted submission to organizing authorities.  Societies that could foster trust and get organized could generally out-compete groups that could not, both economically and militarily, so religion functioned as kind of a darwinian adaptation.  To this day, rightly or wrongly, religious people are generally more inclined to trust and organize politically with other religious people, especially if they share doctrinal beliefs.  (Whether modernity has rendered the adaptation vestigial or even maladaptive is an interesting discussion).

I cannot imagine pop culture fetishists use their fandoms for similar purposes.  There is no organized organized Disney voting bloc, for example, and Star Wars fans do not regard each other as particularly trustworthy any more so than the general population.  Further, pop culture participation does not exclude traditional religious participation.  While both may inspire devotion, they fill different cultural niches and have distinct social meanings.",ibsq47e
"The content of (some) video games, while not causing violence, are a direct symptom of a society that fetishizes violence.","The media has been pointing to video games for years, probably starting in the 90s with the Columbine Massacre, as the culprit behind mass shootings. This is obviously absurd from the view of an average gamer, but I believe that the violent content in video games is actually a symptom of a society obsessed with violence. 

1. The media sensationalizes violence. This is not necessarily because they like to, but because it gets views. It gets views because our society is obsessed with violence. It's not just the news, but movies (like the recent and massively popular Hobbes and Shaw, or Avengers) and video games (do I even need to give examples?), that treat violence as the center piece  to a 'meal', and content is often like the small side of vegetables.

2. Video games do not exist in a cultural vacuum. Games like call of duty and GTA are massively popular in part due to their cultural relevance. GTA takes place in a town modelled after LA, and portrays the various violent crimes of different classes and how they intersect, and call of duty is usually based off of real wars. It's not just that we are obsessed with general violence, but violence in the context of the world around us, and violent video games are a symptom of that obsession. Disclaimer: this is not true for all games but these are just some big examples. 

So, what's my point? Well, I think that just like video games, mass shootings are also a symptom of our obsession with violence. To use the meal metaphor again, maybe it would serve us well as a society to have more balanced meals with our entertainment. Have a side of good story line or other content with that violence, you know? I wont go too much into it, but if you dont agree change my mind.",cmv9jp,Chicken or the egg situation.

Women have been sitting down on toilets forever at home and there's never been an issue with it so why do people think sitting as a man is weird?

Forgiving student debt is classist.,"1. Forgiving student debt is classist
It specifically helps people who are privaleged enough to have gone to college, and the ones with the most debt are the ones who went to expensive private colleges, and stayed in expensive off-campus housing.

2. Forgiving student debt and not medical debt is irrational.
Student debt was acquired knowingly, while medical debt was always acquired as a result of circumstances that are accidental or beyond a person's control. Furthermore, medical debt can often be purchased and forgiven for a fraction of its cost.

3. Forgiving student debt helps people who aren't hurting the worst. 
Many people I know with student debt earn twice what I make and already have bought a house. Having a college degree, or even some college has been shown to improve future earnings. Why do people with higher earning potential deserve free money, while people with lower earning potential can't afford a place to live and receive nothing.

4. It does nothing to help people who couldn't afford college be able to go.
If we wanted to encourage education, a better course would be A. Free community college for all. B. Two years tuition at a public University free for all.

5. If they bought beer or lived in an expensive apartment during college, then that's money that could've gone to reduce their debt, so forgiving their debt is basically buying them alcohol, luxuries and partying. 

6. If you want to give out $10,000, it should be to everyone who earned under $50,000 in 2020, instead of  the folks earning $90k a year with $400,000 homes who went to expensive schools and now have good jobs.

7. The best actual solution to helping people in massive debt is to cap the student loan interest rate at the federal reserve rate (currently less than 1%)",l3ui1m,"If you have student loan debt, you're likely part of the working class. Crab mentality is not useful.",gkidzzh
a sexless relationship is as bad as a cheating relationship,"While literally on the opposite ends of the spectrum the trauma it creates on the non consenting partner is pretty much the same. Feelings of being unworthy of love, loneliness, abandonment and betrayal. I’ve been in both situations and emotionally I don’t think there’s a difference. To be clear on what I mean by a sexless relationship I don’t mean just the literal act but also next to no affection or meaningful interaction.

Blocking children’s content for Russian children is unethical.,"I work for a popular children’s band in the United States. Among other things, we make wholesome, educational music videos that focus on social-emotional growth and teaching age-appropriate life skills for kids from about 0-5, with a strong focus on toddlers/preschoolers. Recently, our distribution company created a company-wide ban on videos they distribute to Russia. 

This doesn’t sit well with me and I’m struggling to find the upsides to a move like this. While I understand creating pressure on Russia by limiting access to goods and services, I am struggling to see how depriving young children access to positive content that encourages social-emotional learning is doing much more than causing further harm and alienating people who are already subject to copious amounts of propaganda. 

I am also struggling with the idea of what is effectively punishing Russian children for their leaders’ mistakes.",vnojas,"The Russia bans are an act of war. Because, you know, the Russian government has actually destroyed Ukrainian cities, bombed Ukrainian hospitals, and killed Ukrainian children. 

The question isn’t whether Russian children are hurt by the ban (they might well be). The questions are (1) whether Russian children are hurt more than Ukrainian children are helped  (2) which children need the help more (3) whether this strategy to help  Ukrainian children is the best of available options. 

I would argue that efforts to stop the war are both a moral and political imperative. That acts of war often have collateral damage, but I am not going to lose sleep about Russian kids losing out on TV programming when Ukrainian kids are being killed fleeing from their homes.",ieb3mu8
Economic/political system doesn't matter. What matters are how good the people are.,"I will start by saying, my knowledge of Economics is almost zero. That is why I don't have any 'firm' opinion on anything economic and that is why this post.

So, it seems to me, from my very small knowledge of capitalism vs socialism (note that I am from India) that in capitalism, people, especially 'individuals' are basically free to do anything. They fix the money for their product. A capitalist holds the 'capital' and run the company and the employees works under him. He fixes the rules and he has authority over how the company runs and how much profit they make. He also has control over the capital as well as the profit. This is in contrast with socialism/communism, where the people 'have control' over the company. How? By the government. The people exercise their power through the government, and the government controls the company, its policies and profit.

If what I have said above is true, then it seems to be that these 'economic systems' are nothing but different distributions of 'power'. My point mainly comes from my reading about the Soviet Union. Now, I have read both praises and criticisms of the entire Soviet Union 'empire'. Some say that it was dictatorship and centralized nature of Soviet Union which was reason for its downfall, while proponents of Leninism and communism in general say that the economy was great because of Lenin and Stalin and that their 'weaker' and 'capitalistic' successors like Yeltsin, Gorbaschev, plus the World Wars, etc was the reason for Soviet's fall. Basically, Lenin established a centralized economy and political and social system, which made the State the supreme power.

My point is that no matter what system it is, no matter how the power is distributed, there is always a 'power to a few'. In a capitalistic society, the boss has all the power, while in a socialistic society, the State has all the power. But no matter what, somebody has more power than you. So, it doesn't matter how the power is distributed. It matters that how the people who have the power uses that power. In my opinion, if a dictator or a communist leader like Lenin, can be good people who knows what they are doing and are well-intentioned, the economy can be good. If the employers in capitalistic economies are well-intentioned and takes care of its employees and their feedbacks, then the capitalist society can definitely improve too. It all depends on how the powerful uses their power.

In my country, there was a dictator named Indira Gandhi. My dad said that she nationalized banks to prevent frauds and cheats. It is true that there were many cheats who would rob people of their money and run abroad. But nationalization and preventing private banks to be established also harms the economy. So, on one hand, you let people do whatever they want and create chaos, and on the other hand, you choose what people do and things become stagnant. Balancing this power distribution, to me, seems to be a fruitless job. There is nothing 'real' about power, and therefore, you cannot balance it at all. What matter is how good are the people, how educated are they, how much do they respect individuals, how much do they know about the leader they choose, etc.

Note: this view is inspired from how I view society. I have seen Trump mocking a disabled reporter. And when I saw that, my fear wasn't that a person like Trump is the POTUS. It was a fear of those people standing behind Trump, cheering and booing the disabled person. Similarly, in my country India, there is a Hindu nationalist who makes derogatory speeches against Muslims and once talked about raping them. I don't fear him. I fear the crowd who cheered him. The people aren't as 'good and innocent' as Marx or communists think. The people needs to be changed, not the systems. If we can change the people, the system will automatically change.",ccrnpf,"There are many schools of marxist or socialist thought, Marxist-Leninism is only one of them. In fact after the soviet revolution and the founding of the Comintern, many communists in Europe split with it over its 'bolshevization' and founded what was then known as [left communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_communism). These people accurately predicted what you criticize about the soviet union: that the centralization of power would naturally lead to authoritarianism and that authoritarianism would naturally lead to undercutting the goals of socialism. If you're interested in theories about anti-authoritarian socialism you might read up on anarcho-sydicalism or the writings of Peter Kropotkin.",etous3b
Two Factor Authentication is Wrong In Its Current Application,"Snapchat has a two factor authentication.

You type in your password and it sends a text to your phone with a verification code. Type in the verification code and you're in.

Problem is that feature is turned on by default. Most people log in one time and forget that it's on. Snapchat plainly says on its site if you are not able to receive that text message you will lose access to your account. Period.

Lose your phone or change your number.... account gone.

I dropped my iPhone 6s - not splash proof - in the toilet. bricked it. They said log into iCloud to get everything back... but I try to log into iCloud off my laptop... it says we sent a verification code to your mobile device... which is bricked.... then it said you can also have a text sent to your phone... which is bricked.  iCloud is meant to be a backup service. Did they consider how to get backed up information if you need a 2nd device and the only other device linked to the iCloud is broken?

And why should I need two devices to log into anything? 

They were so focused on stopping hackers they forgot to consider legitimate users being locked out of their own personal information.  Remember when Microsoft said the XBox one would have to be internet connected at all times to play any game... ever? That's how mad this has me.

It seems insane to me that Snapchat would have a security feature turned on by default that causes you to lose access to the account if you lose access to the phone number. I can think of one million ways that can happen off the top of my head. What if my phone is dead and I want to log into my snapchat from my friend's phone...

Being criticized or fired from your job for things you say does not mean your rights are being taken away,"This is country dependent, but lets just assume that what you said was well within the law. (Ie did not say you will kill someone) Lets say you said 'I hate my boss'. You are now fired. It doesn't matter if it was controversial or not. You being fired does not mean your right to say 'I hate my boss' was taken away. 

I hold this view because it is perplexing to me when people say that their freedom of speech/expression was being taken away. To my understanding, freedom of speech is protecting you from what the government will do, it says nothing about how people react to you.

And what I find ridiculous about this stance is that this would mean people would have to grin and bear it. It means you are saying your boss should have limited rights (firing people) just so YOU can keep your job. 

I think my view is pretty straight forward, and to change it, show me where exactly ones rights are being taken away.",v6e4z6,"People often use the word ""rights"" to mean things besides what the government should do, referring to morality in general.

From this framework, ""the right to free speech"" is the idea that people should be allowed to say anything. That words ought not impact the physical word. That being punished by anyone for ones words is immoral. It's possible to believe that this idea is naive or nonsensical, but that doesn't mean that people don't believe it.",ibeyy65
"English is an objectively hard language to learn, especially its spelling.","Disclaimer: my native language is Dutch, and the only other language I speak fluently is English. I know some Spanish, French and German to but not anywhere close to fluency.

I want to discuss this topic because this is quite hard to get perspectives on, and since I am not a linguist I am not aware if there is any science to back this intuition up.

The first reason why I think English is hard is its spelling. While there are always exceptions, most languages have rather consistent rules to put letters into sounds. But English is just a mess. The cliche example is ghoti (fish), but besides all examples of inconsistent spelling I found that (anecdotally) native English speakers (who learn from hearing) make more spelling mistakes than non-native speakers (who more often learn from reading) because there is not a very strict relationship between sound and letters. Conversely, this means that as a non-native speaker you are going to mispronounce a lot of words at first. This issue gets even worse when you consider the large number of homophones, words spelled the same but with different pronumciation and meaning.

Then there is the grammar. The meaning of a word depends mainly on its place in a sentence. For me personally, since Dutch works similarly, this was not as hard to learn, but I can imagine that if you are not used to it it must be quite difficult. I also saw people who were learning Dutch really struggle with this. In my opinion languages where the role of a word in a sentence is also denoted with a prefix or suffix  are easier to learn.

So CMV: while the difficulty of learning a language is for a large part subjective, English has some unique features that make it harder than most other languages (which is ironic considering its current lingua franca status).

Since ""most"" is a bit of a weasel word, this is mainly about other European languages, but examples of exotic languages that are even more terrible to learn are also welcome.",kvayua,Know its' knot,gixjgig
Americans are less racist than Europeans,"As stated, America imo is less racist than Europe. Why? For starters, there's a lot more people of color in the States than in Europe. Britain and France are two countries you probably think of as very diverse in Europe. France and Britain however are both 80+% white. America is only around 60% white. Most white people have grown up with brown/blacks all their lives. The only reason you hear more about racist incidents in America is because there is a lot more interactions with colored people and they also have more media presence in the world. Europe, especially in the Eastern regions, are highly racist or ignorant of POC.

Modern psychiatry is a joke as a medical practice,"I'd like to preface this by saying I am referring to psychiatry that is most affordable to the public and not the pricey, private practice psychiatrists. his distinguished will be important later.

Psychiatry from the 1920s until about the 60s or 70s was a more legit medical practice than it is today. Back then, psychiatry was more about psychoanalysis (which is a joke in it's own way) and psychotherapy rather than biomedical models that rely on medication. These days, psychiatry is mostly about throwing pills at any and all problems. Broke and can't afford rent that's due in a week? Here's an SSRI that may or may not work in 4-6 weeks and won't do anything to alleviate your money woes. Face extreme insomnia, stress, and irritability because of racial discrimination? Have some velafaxine (an SNRI) augmented with lithium, or buspar, or an antipsychotic (even though you aren't psychotic). 

What's that? That Prozac didn't work? Well we need to up your dose, or switch you to Lexapro, or augment it with BuSpar. While there is certainly a medical case to be made for the use of psychiatric medication like antidepressants, those pills don't fix a damn thing. Still not working? Let's just blame non-compliance to medication! Or claim they are treatment resistant and add some more pills to that cocktail! 

Now not all modern psychiatrists are this way. Psychotherapy and medication tends to be the most effective combination for combating major depressive disorder, GAD, and other common psychiatric illnesses. Psychiatrists who are in private practice, who prescribe meds *and* do psychotherapy all in one tend to be highly effective at their practice. But those are the folks who go for $150-300 a session, so if you aren't rich, you get a psychiatrist to prescribe meds and a basic therapist for psychotherapy. Or, you rely on your PCP/GP to just give you meds. 

You cannot medicate life away.

The concept of an omniscient (*) and capable creator is not compatible with that of free will.,"For this argument to work, omniscient minimally entails that this creator knows what will ever happen.

Hence the (\*).

Capable means that this creator can create as it wishes. 

1) Such a creator knows everything that will happen with every change it makes to its creation. Nothing happens unexpectedly to this creator.

2) Free will means that one is ultimately the origin of their decisions and physical or godly forces are not.

This is a clear contradiction; these concepts are not compatible. The creator cannot know everything that will ever happen if a person is an origin of decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: This was inspired by a chat with a Christian who described these two concepts as something he believes both exist.

Every action can have infinite possible results. But say, assume, Jackson has a rock. Jackson will either throw it at the neighbor's window or drop it.

`CASE A: If Andy throws it and breaks the window`

`~~~~CASE A.1: Neighbour complains to his parents`

`~~~~~~~~CASE A.1.1: His parents beat him`

`~~~~~~~~CASE A.1.2 His parents scold him`

`~~~~~~~~CASE A.1.3 His parents make him understand in a friendly way.`

`~~~~CASE A.2: neighbor does nothing`

`CASE B: Andry drops it.`

Here the initial outcome depends on Andy's decisions. The outcome chain depends on the decision of others.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming the creator/god knows every decision that can happen is...just iterating over every possible combination that can possibly happen. (I know this is not your answer)

Correct me if am wrong, however, from my perspective, your argument can be summed down to this statement: ""If God already knows the future, free will cannot exists"".

Now assume God doesn't exist (we will add God back soon) but infinite parallel universes do, which means sooner or later, all possible outcomes are bound to happen.

*An example:* Since given infinite universes, there is a 100% probability that you will choose option A instead of option B in some universe, even with the exact same parameters/variables up to that point. Is that a FreeWill violation? (Remember there is no god in this equation)

This again boils down to if our choices are predefined in those universes or does it depend on you in those universes?  It depends on you. You are the only variable. You are the only variable that changes.

Now think about this in terms of infinity. If there are infinite iterations, it can be said that things/actions will be repeated infinitely. So it's just infinite iterations happening infinite times. Put god back in. God knows all possible outcomes and knows all future branches. But still, the decision at the moment still depends on you. The variable...or Not.

To be honest, I don't know. Haha. It's a nice question but I think we will never know the answer. We can't even grasp infinity. Just thinking about infinity nested inside infinity, infinite times blows my mind.",glwo4mq
Owning an assault weapon is pointless.,"In my view, widespread ownership of assault rifles in the USA has more to do with fashion than anything else. While there are plenty of valid reasons for a civilian to own a gun, I see no reason to own an assault rifle. Beyond aesthetics, civilian AR-15 style rifles offer no meaningful advantage over non-assault weapons.

Perhaps you're interested in home defense. It's fairly well excepted that a 12 gauge shotgun is the best gun for home defense . The ratcheting sound is a deterrent, and it's more reliable and easier to shoot under pressure than a rifle or pistol.

Maybe you're prepping for when SHTF. When the zombie horde is approaching, your best bet is a .22 lr rifle. It's totally lethal if you're a good shot, and you can easily store 2,000 rounds in your bug-out bag. This is the common sense decision over a higher caliber rifle or pistol.

Suppose you're a resistance fighter apposing a tyrannical government. Although assault rifles are designed for use in battle, any successful resistance would avoid battles altogether, instead relying on guerrilla tactics and asymmetric warfare.",ejyhms,"If you live in urban areas, yes, the shotgun is best.

All political stances ultimately divide into being supported by verifiable fact or virtuous principle.,"There is no in-between; many debated topics are divide in this manor and although individual arguments may be mixed among the two standpoints, there is always one argument that is mostly based on circumstantial evidence and one argument based of hopeful optimism.

 Climate-change and the people arguing for a social correction are supported by verifiable fact, the people opposing restrictions and new practices argue that the evidence is suspect or the sample isn't relative meaning that we haven't sampled enough to disrupt the economy, an virtuous principle that some do not believe in. Abortion is verifiably an end of life, and the verifiable fact that zygotes don't have the same rights as a citizen is the basis for pro-choice parties while the virtuous principle that human-life is universally equal and should be made equal by legislation is the basis for pro-life parties. People in support of Sex-work legalization and regulation cite the verifiable fact that sex acts have been exchanged for money for centuries and it continues to this day regardless of legality, people opposed to Sex-work legalization and acceptance believe that sex acts are extremely meaningful and should only be performed between loving partners, a virtuous principle that not all adhere to. Communism has not been proven successful in practice, it is a verifiable fact that most Communist states do not sustainability support and defend their citizens, people arguing that successful Communism is attainable base their beliefs on the virtuous principle that people will treat each other fairly at all times if educated properly.

Art can be judged by personal opinion or quality. Both are subjective,"Sometimes, when reviewing a movie or a game, some critics say it is ""objectively bad"" or ""no one can deny it's the best of its genre"". When confronted and told that everyone has a different opinion, the answer tends to be the same one: ""Of course, everyone's personal taste or enjoyment is different, and it's subjective. But that's different from quality, which is objective"".

The thing is, I do believe they're two separate things. I love, for example, the ""Batman Forever"" movie, but I think it's a bad movie. That is a dissonance in quality and my enjoyment (what's normally called ""guilty pleasure""), but I still believe they're both subjective.

Why do I? Well, for starters, if art were objective, there would be clear guidelines as to what makes a movie good or bad, and there would be no need for different reviews. There would be an organization that would determine objectively its quality, without possible disagreement. I believe that, despite people asking reviewers to be objective or getting mad when they think they weren't, the only objective things you can say about a movie are true proven facts, like the name of the film, the director, the techniques used, the length... The rest is subjective, and it comes from two things:

Criteria: There's no specific criteria por every film. There are some a majority of us can agree on, like ""Plot needs to be interesting"", or ""Sci-fi action movies must have stunning visuals"". Still, someone could argue there's no need for that to make a good movie.

Adherence to that already subjective criteria: Let's take we all agree on ""Good plot"" as a criteria for movies. Now, how is objective what means a plot is good or bad? Some people may hate coincidences and feel they only make for contrived plots, and a contrived plot is a bad plot. Another one may differ and give more importance to, say, character arcs. Even if both agreed on plot holes being a bad thing, one of them can think a certain plot hole is huge and another one might overlook it.

That's why art could never be objective. There's too many things to take into account that subjectivity almost gets in the way, and our personal understanding will always be determinant for our opinion. It's not even about, as some people say, the art managing to reach the author's goal. Why should it be like that? If a writer tries to evoke sadness with his book and IMO it fails to do so but it has an outstanding worldbuilding, why would it be bad?",crbr0l,"So I’m a little late to the party here, but I wanted to chime in.  The truth is that I’m not sure if I fully understand the implications of what you’re putting forth, so I’m not sure to what degree I’m really wanting to change your view.

If you’re saying that there is never an instance in which we can say that “this work is better than this other work” and demonstrate that claim using evidence from the artwork itself, then I *very* much disagree with you.  But I don’t actually think that’s what you’re saying?  This might sound like a silly question, but what exactly do you mean by subjective and objective? 

My main thought reading your post, though, is that I wondered how much you are making a commentary on “art” and how much you are making a commentary on evaluation in general.  So, for example, let’s consider science.  Would you regard the Milgram experiment as better science than, say, a lava lamp experiment that you do with children?  It’s certainly more innovative, although it doesn’t necessarily follow the scientific method more precisely.  And it’s almost certainly less ethical.  So which of these things do we prioritize when evaluating the quality of a scientific experiment?  If we continue your line of thinking, we’d have to conclude that evaluating the quality of science is subjective.  But that seems like a really weird (and kind of problematic) conclusion to draw.  Just because we might find ourselves in a situation where we have to decide what criteria to privilege when evaluating a science experiment, doesn’t mean that determining the quality of science is subjective.  Just because we might find ourselves in a situation where we have to decide what criteria to privilege when evaluating an artwork, doesn’t mean that determining the quality of artworks is subjective.",ex46n65
"While not decisive, the United States did achieve a partial Victory in the War of 1812","**Initial Clarifications:**

I'm not saying it was some total victory like the World Wars. This isn't some blatant American Propaganda. But, it seems to me the US achieved most of its war goals. Not everything fits neatly, sure, but mostly. 

**War Overview**

For those who are not Canadian or American and don't know what happened, here's a brief overview.

The Americans decided that they didn't much like paying taxes, and did a little trolling until the British got bored and left. They agreed on the terms in the Treaty of Paris, including that the US was now a country that could carry out its own domestic and foreign policy, the location of the border, the terms of Americans paying British debts, and that British Loyalists wouldn't get lynched. 

The British and Americans both immediately violated these terms aggressively, with the British refusing to respect the Northern border, sponsoring Native Tribal armies in the Northwest territory that were engaged in a bit of sem-religious genocide, and refusing to acknowledge the citizenship status of Americans as such. The US, for its part, did a little bit of recrimination against loyalists. 

**War Goals**

Stated goals for the United States:

1. Gain trade access to France &amp; Europe at large &amp; halt cargo seizures (Rule of 1756). 
2. Stop British impressment of American sailors (Gain recognition of American citizenship). 
3. Good, old-fashioned expansionism (into Canada, but also West)
4. British-backed Native tribal armies in the Northwest Territory doing a bit of light pillaging
5. British-controlled forts across the agreed upon border (Which was in retaliation for the recriminations, but that seems pretty flimsy to me. Ask the Spanish and Argentines how Britain feels about its forts in other people's territory.)
6. Source of National Pride (FUCK the British).

Goals 1 and 2 are listed in the declaration of war from June 18th, 1812. Nobody reasonable disputes #3 that I'm aware of. 

Stated Goals for Britain

1. Slow or stop American Westward expansion (By supporting Techumseh &amp; co.)
2. Enforce blockade of Europe (To beat Napoleon)
3. Don't lose Canada (Obviously).

**Goals Achieved:**

US:

1. Trade with Europe (Waterloo and all, mostly a coincidence.)
2. No more impressment (Which had stopped already in part because Britain hoped to avoid war with America. But nobody new until it was too late to back down).
3. Nope lmao. Although an argument could be made that the seizure of illegal British forts in territory ceded after the Revolution counts as expansion, I'm not going to do that for reasons you'll see shortly. It would be cheating. 
4. Techumseh was defeated at Fallen Timbers, in part due to the British cutting them off. Native resistance in the area collapsed.
5. Forts were captured and the territory was ceded. Sounds like a dub to me. 
6. Battle of New Orleans was a major US victory against the odds. Other victories, like the initial advances into Canada and the Battle of Baltimore also occurred. 

Britain

1. Failed. Tribal allies defeated. The US would go on to occupy more Western territory than the British would have liked. There are several treaties about it. 
2. Maybe? I'll give it a firm ""I Suppose"". The British ended up winning, so its a 1/2 for math's sake. 
3. Yes. Mostly. Canada is basically the US now, but that was the result of a different war and the war delayed that so full credit to the British. 

So right off the bat, the US accomplished 83% of their goals, and the British accomplished 83% as well. Good show. The US spent most of its time fighting the Indian allies, not fighting the actual war with the British. The US was able to secure some victories, and so were the British. 

That said, the Status Quo Ante Bellum resolution allowed the US to gain some land (Or at least some forts), remove the single largest obstacle to Westward expansion, and was able to get past it strategically. The British were not able to recover strategically.

Political polarization has nothing to do with one side being 'crazy' and everything to do with social media algorithms.,"The problem with polarization in modern politics is entirely due to to the way information is consumed. 

In the not too distant past, it used to be the case that a moderate lefty (such as myself) had more in common with a moderate conservative, than the extreme left.

And with relatively few platforms available - a handful of broadsheet newspapers, TV channels and radio stations. Open debate around the center ground was much more common. Particularly in Britain with only 5 channels when I grew up. 

You could be left wing, support gay marriage and welfare. But also be pro deregulation and limited government spending. As you were privy to both sides of the debates on these topics.

Social media was initially supportive of this. Until the algorithms were changed to artificially feed us 'more of the same' content. This was then egged on by foreign interests, russian bots, misinformation campaigns etc. To further drive us apart. Hence the 'echo chamber effect'.

The result was even moderate conservatism became increasingly alien to most on the left, and vice versa. 

And people on the moderate right started to believe they had more in common with the fringes than with moderate conservatives. Once again, vice versa also applies on the left 

This then led to a spiralling radicalisation of both sides.  The level of disagreement has now become absurd. And the only variable that has changed is the advent, not of social media generally, but of the algorithms that quite literally drove us apart.

It is my view that polarization has little to do with one side being innately 'crazy', and everything to do with the lack of conversation between moderates. And the driving force behind this division comes from the way social media companies continue to push content.

Louis CK did nothing wrong.,"**Quick recap for those who don't know**: Louis CK was accused by several women of sexual misconduct, to which he immediately admitted and apologized. This probably seemed like the smart thing to do at the time, but instead of being forgiven, this threw him into a negative social media spiral and his career appeared to be dead. However, he is still trying to claw his way back, by just continuing to do stand-up and relying on his very loyal fanbase. 

**I must also admit a bias here:** I am a huge Louis fan. No denying it. My judgement is impaired since I do not have the necessary observational distance to determine whether the man I consider to be a genius, truly is guilty of sexual misconduct or not. Therefore I bring it to you, with a solemn promise that I am willing to change my view and opinion, if my concerns are sufficiently responded to. 

Okay, here goes: 

&amp;#x200B;

*Getting the story straight*

Louis was accused by five women. And there was some misinformation floating around at the time of the original New York Times article. Most significantly, there was mentions of rumors which were later confirmed untrue, like the one where he allegedly blocked a doorway and just pulled it out. As I am defending him now, as far as I know, the story goes like this: Louis has a bit of a kink. It's not very flattering or appealing, but it's certainly not illegal (not necessarily even immoral). Louis then expresses his sexual desires by asking each of these women, I assume very politely, if he can masturbate in front of them. Some of the women in question said no and he respected that. The others said yes and so naturally he did what he asked if he could do. **He asked for consent and received it, and when denied he respected it.** If this is not how the events transpired, please correct me. 

&amp;#x200B;

*The power dynamic argument and coerced consent.*

The general argument made by the women who came forward, and the people who supported them, was that Louie's status as a mainstream comedian, gave him coercive power. The women in question were in fact comedians themselves, just less successful, which likened their relationship to that of an employer and an employee. The women in question stated that they were afraid to say no, because they were afraid this could have negative implications on their careers. 

There's no denying that there is a power dynamic there, but my take is this; power dynamics are literally everywhere. And if we say what Louis did was wrong, we're basically saying that famous people cannot have sex with less famous people, rich people cannot have sex with poor people, the powerful cannot have sex with the powerless, because in these instances the lesser party's consent could always potentially be coerced, and therefore it isn't genuine consent. **In practical terms, by the same standard of logic, this means that grown women, do not have the ability to grant genuine consent, where there exists an underlying power dynamic.** **Much like the same way a child can't.** (Another basic power dynamic here is the physical one, where men are, at least in general, are the physically dominant party. A dynamic which has plagued women for centuries and which we all, *hopefully*, aim to make unproblematic in the socially progressed future.)

&amp;#x200B;

*Final thoughts*

I'm not denying the fact that these women most likely genuinely felt like their careers were threatened. But to the best of my knowledge, they weren't. The truth is no one except those who were present at the time, can truly know what transpired in those rooms, what was asked and how, or what was insinuated. But I gotta believe that if Louis explicitly or implicitly threatened their careers, they would have included that in the accusations. He was only ever accused of ""abusing his power"", which was made akin to ""sexual misconduct"". And if there never really was a threat, only a perceived threat, did Louis, having received what he perceived to be genuine consent, really have any cause to suspect what he was doing was wrong? 

I mean, people have weird fetishes. They have sexual needs and desires. It's fine. They're not charming or appealing always, but consenting adults can do what they want. And people have a right to pursue those desires. They must have a right to at least ask, right?

I just don't think he deserved to lose his career and have everybody hate him, simply for asking. I mean, is that not crazy? His whole crime was that he explicitly asked for consent. And if even that's a bad thing, then under which circumstances is it okay for Louis CK to ask someone if he can masturbate in front of them?

Please change my view (if I'm wrong). That is all. Thanks.",te4sb0,"Louis CK did nothing illegal; much as insulting a man to his face for no reason is not generally illegal, but many would consider it rude.

Even without the power dynamic, many would say that asking for sexual favors from people whom one has no real prior relationship with is poor manners, creepy, and rude, however legal.",i0ofwv3
"Criminals should be rehabilitated, not punished.","I do not believe in retribution (punishing someone because ""they deserve it""). I instead believe that criminals should be rehabilitated, an actual, honest effort made into making them a better person, as this is more likely to prevent crimes and especially repeat offenses (this obviously won't help prevent crimes committed out of desperation, but neither will punishment) than punishments made for the purpose of deterring a person from committing a crime (criminals often don't think of the consequences before committing a crime, and many believe they will never get caught). Norway does this and it has a much lower crime rate and repeat offense rate than nations like the USA where criminals are sent to prison. Edit: I would like to include again that I believe that retribution is absolutely morally wrong, regardless of the circumstances, and has no redeemable qualities whatsoever. The point of justice is to prevent suffering, not cause it.",d0as3u,"I don't think you're wrong to feel this way, but I don't think there is any evidence that what you're suggesting is possible. Norway is a bad example and does not compare in any way to the US.

The only thing proven to rehabilitate criminal behaviour is time - lots of time to mature.

As somebody who was brought up in a terrible environment and committed many minor crimes, I can tell you with a straight face that the prospect of long jail sentences is 100% the reason why I never committed more serious crimes. There is literally no other reason, as I've never been religious, and didn't even know what morality was until my late teens/early 20s.

I can get behind some reasonable prison reform, but I would never support shortening sentences.",ez90cf8
Stuck porn is basically rape and its popularity is worrying,"I completely understand that the actors performing stuck porn have consented to it and therefore it shouldn’t be treated the same as normal rape porn. However, the sexual fantasy of stuck porn is essentially the idea that a woman is held down in a position where she is unable to move and the man seizes the opportunity and proceeds to have sex with her. I cant imagine anything else that screams rape louder than stuck porn and the fact that its so popular only tells me that alot of men have some sort of internalized rape sexual fantasy.

Edit: my view has been changed",jz0su5,"Some people have straight up rape fetishes. ""Pin me down, choke me, keep going even if I say no"" etc.  There's absolutely nothing wrong as long as both partners consent and know if the other wants to stop.",gdax2mi
Reparations are a stupid idea and nothing more than a virtue signaling tool for Democrats.,"For the purposes of this post, I’ll be talking about reparations in the form of giving financial compensation to every person in America who has been negatively affected by the legacy of slavery? On that topic, we’re brought to the first problem. Who gets reparations? The best time to give reparations was when there were living former slaves. We’re one hundred years away from that time. If there are no living former slaves, do you give it to each black person? Who’s black? How do we define blackness? Is it by one drop of African blood? If so, does a 1% black person deserve reparations? Do they really deserve it if they don’t look black at all? What about black people who immigrated here after slavery was abolished? Do they deserve reparations? I’m genetically about 95% black. My father’s family immigrated to America in the mid-1950s but my mother’s ancestors were slaves. Do I deserve reparations? What about rich black people? Why did they achieve if the legacy of slavery supposedly hangs over them? And most importantly do them, owning all of that money, really need or deserve reparations? All of these questions expose how difficult it is to execute reparations in practice.

Reparations are not just a stupid idea in terms of deciding who qualifies for them, they are stupid because of the money that they waste. If lawmakers want to help black people, they need to make a better investment with the money that they would spend on reparations. Think about where else that money could go. Healthcare. Welfare. Inner city schools. Investments into all of these(especially schooling) would help the black community way more than throwing money at them. In fact, the funding of schooling would not only be a significant help to the black community, but it would also increase black social mobility thus combatting the racial wealth gap and lowering crime rates. The point is though that there are far better things to spend the money than on reparations. The only democrats who preach reparations use empty promises to fish for the black vote. It’s disgusting and abusive. As a black person, I would like to hear ideas 
that can help the black community(maybe even all mostly poor communities?) that aren’t hard to execute and aren’t a waste of money. However, I would also like to see the other side of this argument. If you support reparations, why?

Edit: Overall, you guys have convinced me that reparations can go beyond what I’ve originally described, and that I even mentioned forms of reparations(schooling, etc) in my argument. I still hold my belief that the “free money” form of reparations would be impossible to execute, but I’ve been convinced on it in theory in that if there were a way in the modern day to get all those who benefited from slavery to pay all of those who suffer because of it, then I would support that. I just believe that that would be impossible to determine therefore impossible to do. If you think that you can convince me that “free money” reparations can work in practice, then feel free to. Otherwise, thank you for having this conversation with me.",c44hol,I'd like to hear more about this virtue signalling thing.  What do you mean by that?,ervpwi0
mortality makes life not worth living.,"What's the point of it all if at some point it will all be forgotten? Every song I've listened to, game I've played, movie I've watched, place I've been. Poof, no more ""me"" to have the memory of it and it's all gone. As far as I know, the universe did not exist before my birth and will not exist after I'm dead. Everything is like a book that after you finish reading will be forgotten. So why bother living a full life at all?

Common rebuttals are:

**You can make others happy**, but then they will die as well, so everything you do for them will have been forgotten.

**You can experience pleasure in the meantime** which honestly I cannot accept. It literally would disgust me to think that the only purpose of life is just to pump dopamine into my stupid monkey brain which I didn't even want in the first place.

Related to this: note how 90% of what we call pleasure is just absence of pain. Food, sex, sleep etc is just satisfying a need. Which means that not only we are given by nature a super-limited lifespan, but more than a half of this we have to spend into satisfying biological needs, which just adds insult to injury to me.

The only pleasures worth pursuing are art and knowledge, but those, as I said, are going to be nullified by death.

"Posting screenshots of horrific events and saying ""fuck ____"" is slacktivism and does not do much for a cause.","Every time I log onto social media, there's always posts about horrific events or undesirable things happening (especially US posters). I think it does not help a cause much.

It's slacktivism at it's finest. Many say they care about the cause... but they don't do anything but post things like ""Fuck your 4th of July, look at this horrific event"" or ""Fuck D. Trump, he did ____""

I don't take an issue with disliking Trump or being disgruntled by current events. The issue I DO have is when people post this shit, then proceed to go on about their daily lives as if they did some holy crusade on their own. It's just lazy. I understand it spreads awareness, but what's the point if everyone knows but doesn't do anything about it? 

I think people need to actually take action if they want to post stuff like that. Like call local representatives or call people to action (protests, boycotts, ect.)

Antivax doctors and nurses (and other licensed healthcare personnel) should lose their licenses.,"In Canada, if you are a nurse and openly promote antivaccination views, you can lose your license.

I think that should be the case in the US (and the world, ideally).

If you are antivax, I believe that shows an unacceptable level of ignorance, inability to critically think and disregard for the actual science of medical treatment, if you still want to be a physician or nurse (or NP or PA or RT etc.)  (And I believe this also should include mandatory compliance with all vaccines currently recommended by the medical science at the time.)

Just by merit of having a license, you are in the position to be able to influence others, especially young families who are looking for an authority to tell them how to be good parents.  Being antivax is in direct contraction to everything we are taught in school (and practice) about how the human body works.

When I was a new mother I was ""vaccine hesitant"".  I was not a nurse or have any medical education at the time, I was a younger mother at 23 with a premature child and not a lot of peers for support.  I was online a lot from when I was on bedrest and I got a lot of support there. And a lot of misinformation. I had a BA, with basic science stuff, but nothing more My children received most vaccines (I didn't do hep B then I don't think) but I spread them out over a long period.  I didn't think vaccines caused autism exactly, but maybe they triggered something, or that the risks were higher for complications and just not sure these were really in his best interest - and I thought ""natural immunity"" was better.  There were nurses who seemed hesitant too, and Dr. Sears even had an alternate schedule and it seemed like *maybe* something wasn't perfect with vaccines then. My doctor just went along with it, probably thinking it was better than me not vaccinating at all and if she pushed, I would go that way.

Then I went back to school after I had my second.

As I learned more in-depth about how the body and immune system worked, as I got better at critically thinking and learned how to evaluate research papers, I realized just how dumb my views were.  I made sure my kids got caught up with *everything* they hadn't had yet (hep B and chicken pox) Once I understood it well, everything I was reading that made me hesitant now made me realize how flimsy all those justifications were. They are like the dihydrogen monoxide type pages extolling the dangers of water. Or a three year old trying to explain how the body works.  It's laughable wrong and at some level also hard to know where to start to contradict - there's just so much that is bad, how far back in disordered thinking do you really need to go?

Now, I'm all about the vaccinations - with covid, I was *very* unsure whether they'd be able to make a safe one, but once the research came out, evaluated by other experts, then I'm on board 1000000%.  I got my pfizer three days after it came out in the US.

I say all this to demonstrate the potential influence of medical professionals on parents (which is when *many* people become antivax) and they have a professional duty to do no harm, and ignoring science about vaccines does harm.  There are lots of hesitant parents that might be like I was, still reachable in reality, and having medical professionals say any of it gives it a *lot* of weight.  If you don't want to believe in medicine, that's fine, you don't get a license to practice it.  (or associated licenses)  People are not entitled to their professional licenses.  I think it should include quackery too while we're at it, but antivax is a good place to start.

tldr:

Health care professionals with licenses should lose them if they openly promote antivax views. It shows either a grotesque lack of critical thinking, lack of understanding of the body, lack of ability to evaluate research, which is not compatible with a license, or they are having mental health issues and have fallen into conspiracy land from there.  Either way, those are not people who should be able to speak to patients from a position of authority.

I couldn't find holes in my logic, but I'm biased as a licensed professional, so I open it to reddit to find the flaws I couldn't  :)

edited to add, it's time for bed for me, thank you for the discussion. 

And please get vaccinated with all recommended vaccines for your individual health situation.  :) ",o3adet,"What I’m wondering is when the anti-vax nurses and professionals will be given their own legal ground to operate a medical system under an authority that is attuned to their ideals, understandings, and objectives.

What I mean is. We have essentially a government, assigned medical authorities the role of making clear and crucial decisions on a matter as debatable as the mass vaccination of the whole world.

I for one, want no part of any modern medicine, clinic, or health system, that operates under the authority of a medical college and government making their own best decisions on what my health should or shouldn’t be.

For now, I won’t be calling 911, seeing a doctor, or visiting a hospital.

But I would be happy to see medical establishment in our current world that is not catering and controlled by authorities with the motivation to publicly pressure coerce or control the direction of society.

The problem in this case, is that politics has taken precedence over medicine. I think that a very good doctor, who has a good awareness of the reasoning behind anti-vaccination belief and practice, should be able to be a licensed practitioner in the full disclosure of their motive and medical practice.

Not vaccinated? Don’t want to be? Visit the hospital on Main St. They are licensed in the alternative practice, and can suit your needs better.

"The US government is very bad at keeping secrets from it's people, and any knowledge of extraterrestrial life would be leaked","Conspiracy theorists and alien enthusiasts routinely posit the existence of covert government programs which are in possession of either aliens, their craft, or just knowledge of their existence. They go on to explain that the reason we lack proof of these activities is a systematic and exhaustive program of concealment, intimidation, and 'psyops' disinformation campaigns. In my opinion, the easiest way to weed out most conspiracy theories is to consider the plausibility of the cover-up.

If it involves something publicly salient then people will be inclined to talk / leak it. By publicly salient I mean something the average citizen cares about. Like domestic surveillance, prison abuse, aliens, etc. The military can keep technical secrets all day long. Regular people don't give a shit about how fast a new missile can fly, and have no context for the information. 700mph? OK.

Abu Ghraib was a secret military prison in the middle of a war zone and we got pictures of it. Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden, and Julian Assange were all willing to endanger their freedom and safety to expose goverment surveillance and secrecy. MKUltra was a secret program the CIA director himself tried to destroy all record of and it still got out. I could go on and on.

If we had any alien material it would be the biggest technology endeavor since the Manhattan Project - which was barely kept secret. The Germans and Soviets quickly knew something about it and were aggressively infiltrating. But the Manhattan Project only had to be kept secret for 3 years before the core truth was revealed. And it was kept secret during WWII when the public was (a) distracted by the war, (b) loyal and conscientious about secrecy, and (c) limited to official (government censored) news channels.

Try putting 130,000 people on a project now and keep it secret. Impossible. None of the conditions that enabled wartime secrecy in WWII exist now. The public is eager to hear secrets exposed and truths revealed. And people are eager and able to give it to them. Now imagine keeping it secret for *decades*. Roswell happened in 1947. If we had aliens for 73 years that's 3 *generations* of scientists, techs, guards, and officials on the project. All kept quiet even through retirement and deathbeds?

Conspiracists claim that the government (or the boogieman *du jour*) is good at silencing people. No it's not. It's terrible at it. America is actually really fucking free. Bob Lazar, for example, claims that the MIB erased the record of his attendance at MIT and Caltech, and that witnesses were bullied into denying ever knowing him. Can you imagine a federal agent trying to tell a tenured professor at an elite university that he can't say something? You could silence one private citizen or another if they're in a vulnerable position, but on any kind of scale the conspiracy breaks down.

Lastly, Trump couldn't keep his Ukraine deal secret. You think he's keeping his lips sealed on ET? He couldn't not tweet about it. He'd die. OK maybe they don't tell him.",fa6ddn,"The government operates on a need-to-know basis, and security clearances are in place to determine who needs to know what information. (Side note: having a clearance doesn’t mean you can see all information at that clearance level, just what you need to know.) Only in cases of moral dilemmas do government employees break their oaths of secrecy to leak classified information (i.e. Snowden). There is no scenario I can imagine where those privy to knowledge of aliens, if there are aliens, could simultaneously have the rank and clearance necessary to have that knowledge, and have the kind of moral compass that would lead them to a dilemma about keeping silent. 
Government officials with this kind of clearance would have surely been trusted with lower level clearance information for years, rising to the top of their agencies along the way. By the time they would get the information, they would be at such a level that maintaining national security would be a mission in their job description. Leaking verifiable info about aliens would destabilize the world. There is no moral counter to justify that decision.
I believe that anyone in a position to know about aliens would not be the kind of person that would leak it.

Reddit should show your ratio of upvotes to downvotes in order to dissuade people from blanket down voting,"I've seen some Subreddits encourage users not to downvote posts so that theirs appears higher in rankings, which is a problem some subreddits are more blighted with than others (especially advice subreds).

The Naked Lady Might Be On To Something,"I shook my head when I read about the [naked protester in Seattle](https://nypost.com/2020/07/19/protester-dubbed-naked-athena-faces-off-with-portland-police/). But then I had a thought. 

In his book Iron John, Robert Bly talks about what it takes to turn a man into a monster and what it takes to bring him back to his humanity. Warrior cultures had rituals for making young men into “berserks”, on fire for brutal combat and savage cruelty. But how can you possibly bring your men home again and be safe in their company? If I remember correctly, Bly says that in some Celtic cultures there was a ritual that these men were made to re-enter the village past rows of their women-folk, their own mothers included, who had bared their breasts to the returning warriors. 

The suggestion is that the sight of their own women folk, vulnerable, defenseless, inviting them to become human again, to rejoin civilization, to come home, would rekindle their compassion. Cool the homicidal rage with which they’d intoxicated themselves in order to go to war. To shed the beast and become the man again. 

I rolled my eyes with everyone else when I heard about this woman. But this may not be an entirely random act. It may have some psychological validity, or at least mythological precedent. What if all the protesters were naked (it’s summer). What if they all faced the line of shock troops and said quietly “We’re your brothers. We’re your sisters. We’re your mothers and your fathers and your children. Stop this.”

Probably it wouldn’t work. But then could Fox still claim the protesters were the violent ones? How long could the police sustain the optics of attacking absolutely, entirely, indisputably defenseless citizens demanding an end to violence?

I’m starting to think I shouldn’t have been so quick to laugh at the naked lady. Change my view.",hvdq5s,"FYI OP, Naked Athena is in Portland, not in Seattle. Sadly, we Seattlites have not yet harnessed the power of bewbs to intimidate our local teargas dispensers.",fysrlmd
"YouTube is ""not profitable"" because of Hollywood accounting","Why I hold this view: I am a writer-director in the science documentary space and have made numerous shows for the likes of Discovery Channel, National Geographic, History Channel, etc... some of which have even received multiple Emmy nominations. Every show I've worked on has had multi-million dollar budgets... and yet none of them have come anywhere close to attracting the size of audiences that factual channels like Vsauce, Smarter Every Day, Action Lab, Real Life Lore, Veritassium, Kurtzgesagt, etc... generate. 

In the traditional TV doc space, we would KILL for these kinds of numbers! And yet, minute-by-minute, these YouTube shows cost orders of magnitude less than what it costs to produce a competitive product on traditional TV. 

Ok, sure, let's acknowledge the critical fact that one traditional hour of television has roughly 30 ""units"" of adspace to sell (1 unit = 30 seconds of ad), whereas, 60 minutes of youtube content (broken up into multiple videos as is typical on the platform) has only 6 or so units. From what I see, the raw commercial value of 1 hour of traditional TV, at this moment in time, is thus unarguably greater than 1 hour of YouTube content even when all factors are considered (e.g. engagement, audience perceived value, audience attention, demographic focus, accuracy of viewership numbers, likelihood of conversion, etc...) ....Or is it?

Regardless, YouTube does not pay in advance for its content! It simply rewards content that it likes, punishes content that it does not like, and offers little to no explanation as to why. 

Further, YouTube charges adbuyers on average $0.1 per view and $0.3 per action. For 1,000,000 views-only from a targeted and highly curated audience, the adbuyer will thus pay YouTube about $100,000... which is about on par with what an adbuyer will pay for 30 seconds during a nationally broadcast TV show that generates a similar 1,000,000 viewers in ""the demo"". 

So, When a YouTube content creator achieves 1,000,000 viewers who watched one 30 second ad at the start of a 10+ minute video, the content creator will receive, on average, about $2,000 ([source](https://boingboing.net/2019/09/17/how-much-money-does-a-youtuber.html)). This seems like an blatant grift, but when you run the numbers, it equates out to about 2% of ad revenue paid to the content creators for a YouTube video v.s. 3.3% of ad revenue paid to the content creators for a traditional TV show. Further, the majority of the most popular content on YouTube has only one ad, and this ad is always up front signaling to the viewer that it is something that must watch BEFORE they get to the content that makes them happy. The Adobe corporation has studied this effect and rated it as one of the most significant reasons why ""[TV is still king](https://cmo.adobe.com/articles/2018/9/tv-advertising-isnt-deadits-evolving-.html#gs.yeci0b)"" 

So, roughly speaking, YouTube content creators are paid *somewhat similarly* to the producers of traditional TV content. 

But here's the thing... we can justify traditional TV Network sharing a mere 3% of their revenue with creators based on the fact that these networks spend exorbitant amounts promoting and marketing the content that their creators produce! YouTube doesn't. Traditional TV networks also take risk UPFRONT by paying for their content before it is produced... YouTube doesn't. 

So, let's ask ourselves the $100,000 per million viewer adbuy question: Where does the $98,000 that YouTube keeps go?

Alphabet (""Google inc"") remains tight lipped about it, much to the [consternation of its shareholders.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/technology/youtube-financial-disclosure-google.html) Even more frustrating, the SEC tried like hell to get Alphabet to explain this, but their on going responses offered little more than, to paraphrase, ""you wouldn't understand it and we're not going to explain it to you."" The SEC [gave up](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/02/28/sec_google_youtube/) and left them with this final word: 

&gt;""We have completed our review of your filing. We remind you that the company and its management are responsible for the **accuracy and adequacy of their disclosures**, notwithstanding any review, comments, action or absence of action by the staff."" 

I also suspect that YouTube/Alphabet *might* be strategically hiding behind the ""web 2.0 valuation"" tradition which basically states: ""find 1 million active users first, and then figure out how to monetize them later."" If they can convince their investors that YouTube IS NOT YET a cash cow, even if it is, then all the better for YouTube/Alphabet. Which is another reason why...

**I am convinced that Alphabet is practicing ""Hollywood Accounting"" with respect to the financials of YouTube.** If this is the case, it explains their secrecy and short-changing practices regarding content creators. 

For those not familiar, [an FYI on Hollywood accounting.](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/09/how-hollywood-accounting-can-make-a-450-million-movie-unprofitable/245134/)

It's important to take a moment here to DEFEND Hollywood Accounting, lest my post be read as a conduit for me to bitch about YouTube.  (My earnest goal here is to understand going on behind the curtains at THE LARGEST MEDIA COMPANY IN THE WORLD.)

The reason why Hollywood Accounting exists is not because of greed outright, but because of the EXTREME RISK associated with making movies... especially today when making a feature film for anything less than $150,000,000 is just about the stupidest thing a major movie studio could do (why this is stupid is irrelevant to topic at hand). In 1980, the monster-budget film ""Heaven's Gate"" (written and directed by then Hollywood wunderkind Michael Cimino) was so disastrous that it caused a severe economic depression for our entire industry, and then triggered every major movie studio to be sold to a Big Daddy Corporate Parent Company. Hell, when Steven Spielberg made *Jaws*, the movie studio that bankrolled it was owned by, of all things, an *insurance company.* 

The nature of this business has always been, and always will be, such that the HITS pay for the MISSES. In the 1950s, Hollywood studios exclusively made 500+ films per year, which gave each studio the all important financial liquidity. But today, the major studios only produce about 4-10 exclusive productions ('exclusive' meaning that they pay for everything themselves from start to finish). So, all it takes is ONE disastrous production to bankrupt the entire studio. 

And so the big studios have no choice but to practice Hollywood Accounting. For a variety of reasons that are irrelevant to this discussion, these studios CANNOT make movies without selling large chunks of future profits to various 3rd parties, and so they must do everything in their power to ensure that their products make a shit ton of money... while never *officially* being 'profitable.' This is Hollywood Accounting. It's not a conspiracy, it's a *requirement of doing business.*

YouTube, in my eyes, shows all the signs of following this practice. I have many questions:  what is the extreme risk factor that Alphabet is scared of? What, exactly, are YouTube's operating expenses? How much is YouTube concerned about content creators demanding a larger share of the profits? What is a 'disaster scenario' for YouTube? 

**My view is that YouTube is making GARGANTUAN profits year after year, but they are practicing Hollywood accounting...** most likely because *something* has them shaking in their boots that the whole operation could be ruined in one bad move.  Their official position is that they are genuinely loosing money each year, or barely breaking even.  

Some things that will change my view: 

* good argumentation and/or evidence that explains why YouTube is not profitable
* good argumentation and/or evidence that the share of the profits that content creators receive is fair
* good argumentation and/or evidence that something substantively different than Hollywood accounting practices are at play. 
* good argumentation and/or evidence that ad revenue generated by YouTube is less than or equal to YouTube's specific expenses and NOT AlphaBet's expenses. 
* Any other important and factors that I'm not considering!",fb3q8x,"&gt; good argumentation and/or evidence that the share of the profits that content creators receive is fair

""Fair"" is a squishy concept.

YouTube is providing a free platform that anyone can use to upload content and access hundreds of millions of viewers worldwide.  They assume all the cost and continued expense of storing and hosting the content that's uploaded.  Sure, the creator assumes all the production costs, but YouTube gives them the platform and the audience for free.

YouTubers can build a following and monetize their userbase through things other than getting paid by YouTube.   These include sponsorship spots within the video, sponsored content, affiliate links where the YouTuber can get a small commission if a viewer buys a product through their link, and patreon, where viewers can directly support their favorite content creators.

There are plenty of established YouTubers that are sick of their antics and want to start their own online streaming website (Nebula), which is a paid subscription service, but they aren't abandoning YouTube all together.  That's where their bread is buttered.",fj2uipr
Polygamists are now the largest minority as far as marriage rights being held away from them. If consenting adults choose to take on multiple spouses then they should be allowed to do so,"I think most marriage rights were about power and control of the population but historically they have mostly been business contracts until recently. There is nothing wrong with loving multiple people or wanting to be with multiple people if that’s what the parties want, but because of health insurance and other benefits being awarded to spouses it would be more costly to the capitalism machine. I’m sure people could abuse this system too but I don’t see any reason it should be illegal to have multiple wives or husbands

Edit: I’ve heard a lot of good points about challenges with making it legal and why people would be against it, but not necessarily why it should be illegal. Most arguments about death rights, divorce, custody, insurance, etc can be solved with a will or marriage contract as well as proper legislation to protect peoples rights. The only argument I’ve heard that gave some sway was the supply and demand argument and I could see how it could lead to the elite collecting power in the form of women but I think with more women wanting to choose who they marry now instead of being given away that it would not have nearly the same impact of the past. If anyone else has any other valid points I’m happy to listen but I’m not too sure I’ve heard anything convincing at this point",vogboe,"&gt; If consenting adults choose to take on multiple spouses then they should be allowed to do so

Sure, it shouldn't be illegal. That doesn't mean it should be ratified by the state in the same way that monogamous marriage is. For the record, I don't think the state should be involved in the marriage game at all. But if they're going to, we have to ask, whats the point of them doing so?

&gt;I think most marriage rights were about power and control of the population

Not sure what you mean by this specifically, so feel free to expand if you want. I think historically, marriage was used for social, political, and economic reasons. A poorer father might want his daughter to marry up, so to speak. The aspect of joining 2 families in some sort of alliance for the betterment of both was important as well, and not just for the elites. Additionally, the production and rearing of children has usually (until recently) been viewed as most proper and efficacious in the context of a marriage relationship.

And this is where the argument comes in: the state has an interest in the wellbeing of its citizens, as well as in ensuring the next generation are capable, educated, and civically responsible. We have hundreds if not thousands of years of evidence to support the idea that monogamous marriage is a good way to facilitate these goals. We have less to support the idea that polygamy will.

In short, if it ain't broke don't fix it. If you want to be a polygamist, go for it, but the state doesn't have any skin in that game (at least not demonstrably so). The burden of proof would be yours to demonstrate why the state (and society as a whole) would benefit from polygamy before we subsidize it.",iegvx4d
"Unless you have an allergy, or there are other extenuating circumstances, buying a dog from a breeder rather than adopting a dog from a shelter is selfish, vain, and stems from wanting a dog that fits your aesthetic, or from wanting a puppy over a dog, rather than from caring about animals.","I can completely understand why someone would need to purchase a hypoallergenic dog if they have a dander allergy, or why someone would need to seek out a breed with a certain mentality to fit their living situation. However, I'm of the belief that it's absolutely possible to find a good match at an SPCA or Humane Society if you search hard enough in your general geographical area, and I can't help but feel as though the only reason someone would choose to buy from a breeder over adopting from a shelter is because they want an aesthetically pleasing dog. Australian Shepherds are a good current example of this I think -- they're *very* trendy. 

I think it's OK if people are honest about wanting a purebred dog or a trendy dog, but it seems as though, oftentimes, the people that buy from breeders claim to be ""animal lovers"" or ""dog lovers"". I'm not saying that they can't be, I just feel as though adopting dogs that have been abandoned, surrendered, or seized better reflects caring about animals. 

Same goes for people who buy fancy cats.

"""I'm letting these dishes soak"" is nearly always code for ""I'm leaving them to rot until they're so disgusting that someone else breaks down and washes them""","OK, I get it: like, if there's baked-on cheese or something, an hour or so of soaking can help. But how often does that come up? And anyway, more than an hour and you rapidly hit the point of diminishing returns. 

Meanwhile, most stuff ""left to soak"" is just getting marinating in an unholy mix of every contaminant present so everything is now covered with whatever the messiest and greasiest component was. If anything has wooden parts, they are soaking up the grossness like a sponge. And all of this is happening in an anoxic environment that will, if left long enough, begin generating swamp gas. 

In the overwhelming majority of cases, the job is actually much easier and less disgusting if done right away, so it seems to me that ""leaving it to soak"" is mostly just an excuse to try and stall, or better yet, to weasel out of washing dishes completely (shades of Homer Simpson).

anyone in a position of power who has perpetuated the conspiracy that the election was stolen has incited attempts of insurrection is guilty of sedition and should be removed and arrested.,"FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE TRUMP'S TEAM, what happened in DC was not an anomaly, and it was not an overreaction. It was planned, and it was premeditated by a large number of people fantasizing civil war over the issue of a stolen election.

This assault on The Capitol and our senator's safety is what should be expected of people who view themselves as founding-father-loving, mega patriots who now believe that an entire national election was fraudulent. Let me be clear, IF Ted Cruz, Trump, Guiliani were telling the truth, this failed attempt of insurrection was the CORRECT RESPONSE to their accusations, and was in-line with the spirit of The Constitution's statements on a failed government.

You would have to be a complete moron to not expect this hateful, violent, and earth-shattering rhetoric to result in a violent attempt of insurrection. The evidence of where this was going was clear and present on news channels, social media, and influential right-wing accounts. And because the consequences were so clear to the people in power spewing it, they should be removed immediately and tried for their crimes of sedition and inciting violence.",kshicc,So anyone that said Donald Trump is not my president in last 4 years should get rounded up?,giie2b6
"Achieving a ""colorblind"" society with equality of opportunity is the ultimate ideal, but that might mean accepting differences in outcome for along time.","However, temporarily pursuing equity and treating people differently based on their color/ sex in order to combat preexisting oppressive racism and sexism to push towards equality of outcome (slavery reparations, quota hiring, etc) may be a good idea.

The fundamental flaw of modern leftists like BLM, feminists, etc, is that they hold equity (equality of outcome) as the highest goal. Due to fundamental differences between men and women, and differences in culture between ethnic groups, in a hypothetical scenario where treatment of all individuals both individually and systemically is fair and equal, differences in outcome will persist due to personal choice due to the individuals and their inherent characteristics.

The disparities we see today, for example Asian men leading in income, native and white men leading in suicide rate, and black women having the lowest suicide rate, may be be due to racism and oppression rather than individual choice/characteristics.

While BLM and leftists in general want to move society away from racism and oppression they won't know when to stop cause they'll claim sexism exists until soldiers are 50% female (never gonna happen, its biology), and they'll claim racism exists until all the effects of historical differences regarding socioeconomic status between ethnicities (higher income in Jews, Asians, etc) have been completely smoothed out by time.

If you know anything about history you know that Jews are going to continue being among the richest people in the US for a long time regardless of whether antisemitism is eradicated, and sadly the opposite is true of african and native americans regardless of whether racism is eradicated. Even if antisemitism is absolutely purged from society the generational wealth of Jews will continue persisting for many more hundreds of year as it already has.

Likewise, even if hypothetically all racism ends, the generational wealth of BIPOC people will take a very long time to reach a level that is representative of the general population. That's literally what generational wealth MEANS, it means it takes many generations (centuries) to accumulate.

Maybe for clarities' sake I could rephrase what I'm saying to be that even if all bias and prejudice and stigma and unconscious bias etc was completely and entirely eliminated from society there would still be differences in outcome between men and women and different races, due to biological differences between men and women and cultural/historic factors between ethnicities.

Why is this a worthwhile conversation to have? Because: equity is a false ideal, and: equality of opportunity with a combination of eradicating conscious and unconscious bias, is the only way to go, contrary to what SJWs say.

"A Star Trek-style method of teleportation is a ""suicide booth""","So my problem is this: Even if we manage to copy each and every atom like they were precisely before teleportation, each memory and personality trait - we are still talking about creating a **clone.**

My argument is based pretty much on this example: should the recreation process malfunction somehow, we could end up with five identical copies. Would we then talk about five yous or one you + four clones? 

I think it would be five ""yous"", all identically flabbergasted about the situation. Since the original you died in the teleporter when the transfer begun.

The two methods of teleportation - as I see it - are: 

1.   A Star Trek-type transporter via copy-cut-paste. This results in a clone and the original subject being destroyed.
2. A wormhole, where you transport the original body, with its ""mind"" attached. Hence no clone.

I agree that there are a lot semantics and philosophy involved here. First of all, I am a materialist and a firm believer in neurochemistry. I understand that our mind and consciousness exist because of how our brains, neurons and neurotransmitters operate.

That being said, the only way to teleport without disrupting the stream of subjective consciousness would be to create a ""bubble"" of space-time around the subject, and transport them from point A to point B.

"Support of actions such as AWS deplatforming Parler is incompatible with support of net neutrality principles, and opposition to those actions incompatible with opposition to net neutrality","For the purposes of this discussion, I'm using the Wikipedia definition of net neutrality:

&gt; Network neutrality, most commonly called net neutrality, is the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) must treat all Internet communications equally, and not discriminate or charge differently based on user, content, website, platform, application, type of equipment, source address, destination address, or method of communication.

&gt; With net neutrality, ISPs may not intentionally block, slow down, or charge money for specific online content. Without net neutrality, ISPs may prioritize certain types of traffic, meter others, or potentially block traffic from specific services, while charging consumers for various tiers of service.

While the common definition of net neutrality involves ""internet service providers"" as considered to be the consumer-end groups (your Comcasts, Verizons, etc.), the *concept* just as much extends to service providers such as AWS or Azure, which provide a similar service to countless companies and organizations. 

Cloud computing firms are private organizations, much like ISPs.  Net neutrality proponents believe that ISPs should not be able to prioritize or block legal traffic.  Net neutrality opponents believe that ISPs should have the right to have some say over what goes over their wires.  Yet the position often flips when it comes to deplatforming; those who would favor a ""free and open internet"" applaud AWS for deplatforming Parler, those who favor a lighter regulatory touch rage against the actions of the private company.

I don't see how those two positions can square.",kv90qz,"Businesses like Parler often contract out hosting services, just as they might contract out accounting, cybersecurity, or payroll operations. They do this as a convenience, and not necessity.

The kind of neutrality that you suggest here entails that service contractors not be able to choose whether to take a contract. Setting aside liberty issues, that is not a sustainable situation. Contractors who cannot refuse a contract would have little control over the quantity of work they have. They could easily find themselves unable to complete contracts, get sued for breach, go insolvent, then bankrupt, and finally dissolve.",gix146j
Many cases of physical health issues are caused by bad parenting,"Being obese and eating a bad diet puts you in high risk for tons of diseases, such high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and even some types of cancer. If you look at the statistics, you will see that high blood pressure is a life-long disease that affects 77.3 million Americans (1 in 3 American adults). And we all know what causes hypertension. And they even argued that hypertension runs in families and therefore is genetic. I call that bullshit. You show what really runs in families? Bad eating habits. Parents with bad eating habits will pass that down to their kids. I don’t know about you, but I’m glad while I was growing up, I had responsible parents who ensured I learned good eating habits.",gabmk9,"Bad parenting is absolutely, 100% **one of** the factors that **contributes** to the high rates of obesity and related conditions in the US.

That being said there are a handful of factors that are stronger causal mechanisms that better explain the obesity trend. Here are a couple -

**Poverty -**

Poverty, believe it or not, is one of the main drivers of obesity. Our entire food economy is based around mass producing unhealthy food, mostly containing or made out of corn and corn products (corn flour, corn syrup, corn starch, corn meal, etc.) that contains a lot of carbohydrates and very few other nutrients. We also have a meat economy that leaves the lowest quality meat for the cheapest products that have things like fillers and other additives (especially salt) that contribute to poor diets for people who can only afford cheap food. A family with two parents working long hours for not a lot of money can be expected to have a diet consisting of a lot of fast food, bleached grains (white rice, white bread), and corn products.

**Food availability -**

Unfortunately, many areas of our country have what is called a ""food desert"". Food deserts are areas where there isn't an easily accessible supermarket, especially for people who don't drive. If you live in an urban area and can't drive to the grocery store, you're more likely to walk to the corner store or to a fast food restaurant to buy junk food. And then on top of that, many of these corner stores also carry basic groceries like bread, lunch meat, large bags of chips, etc. A lot of the same problems above apply, but then add into that that most of these corner store groceries are very salty, and salt causes the body to retain water, leading to weight gain and bloating, and also causes hypertension. Americans, even in areas with prevalent groceries, eat too much salt.

**Work -**

A lot of people of all socioeconomic classes work long hours in offices. This leads to sitting on your ass for at least 8 hours a day. Many people not only eat a full lunch at their desks, but also cope with boredom through eating. A sedentary lifestyle inherently requires less food for fuel, but people aren't accustomed to skipping lunch or getting by with small snacks, so they continue to eat normal amounts of food. I can't tell you how many fit young adults I know who graduated college and then got a desk job and proceeded to put on 15-20 pounds in the first year.

**Driving culture -**

The majority of Americans drive everywhere they go. For many people their lives are sleep, eat, drive, sit at a desk, drive, sit on the couch, eat, sleep. Not a lot of even walking in that formula. In countries with much lower obesity rates, people walk more. Even if your commute requires getting on a bus or train, chances are you're walking at least part of that.

**Willpower -**

This is my last point. Maintaining good exercise habits and dieting requires a good amount of willpower. It's always easier to not diet and exercise than it is to do those things, so most people just don't do it.

So sure, parenting plays a contributing role to the overall numbers, but there are so many other, bigger factors that discount it as one of the main ones.",foyvufz
People need to stop expecting Disney to adhere to their desires when it comes to minority representation.,"First off, I'm not coming at this from a place of *""Representation doesn't matter""*. I would wager that I'm a bigger advocate for minority representation in media than 99% of the people here. The issue here is that I am also an advocate for *good* representation and think people need to focus on the amazing representative works that are already out there and continue to be made as opposed to expecting Disney to fulfill everyone's representative wants. 

It seems like we go through this all the time. Some Disney property makes some big show about how they are finally going to break some new ground when it comes to minority representation. We saw it with LeFou being ""openly gay"" in the Beauty and the Beast remake. How did that manifest? LeFou is dancing with some unnamed man in the ending for a split second. Oh, there's finally a black lead in a Star Wars movie? What did they do with John Boyega? Fuck all and he's said as much. Oh, there's finally an Asian main character in a Star Wars film? What did they do with Kelly Marie Tran? Fuck all and John Boyega said as much. There's also literally a 0% chance that Rey getting shipped with Kylo instead of film wasn't rooted in Disney being scared or portraying an interracial romance in one of their flagship franchises. Oh, there's a gay character in a Marvel movie. It's some random guy talking to Cap during a therapy session. Oh, Lando Calrissian is pansexual in Solo: A Star Wars Story. How does that manifest? It literally doesn't. Like...at all. Is Elsa gay? Well, they'll keep hinting at it to queerbait you but literally never actually confirm anything. The list of this goes on and on. And now you have people clamoring for a trans Disney princess which they are *never* going to do. 

It seems people have all these wants that Disney is willing to exploit but never actually pull the trigger on. And I think expecting anything else from them is foolish. So I don't understand this constant clamoring for Disney to have a black superhero, or a trans Star Wars character, or a Asian superhero, or an Asian man in a love story with a white woman, etc. You can get all these things without Disney and properties that are meant for teenagers. 

I don't go to Disney for good representation of black people. I go to all the amazing black filmmakers that center the black experience in their narratives. It's more nuanced and more valuable than anything Disney will ever have the guts to even try. When I want to see great Asian representation, I don't need Disney. There's Asian filmmakers all over the world and in the US that are telling amazing stories of their unique experiences. I don't need Disney to see good LGBTQ representation. Disney is totally irrelevant in this arena. 

The only counter example I can think of is, *""Well, think of the children""*. For one, the people clamoring for this representation are adults most of the time. Secondly, there's still good stuff that's kid friendly that are infinitely more daring than Disney is ever going to be. Say what you want about KorrAsami being last minute, but that gay relationship is still more overt and earned than anything I've seen from Disney. And Legend of Korra is for kids/teenagers. Also both ATLA and Legend of Korra are steeped in influence from Asian cultures. There's a lot to dig into there with children. Characters like Static Shock or Jon Stewart from Justice League are infinitely better than John Boyega being forced to play a minstrel show in Star Wars. 

I guess my main point is that people put Disney on a pedestal when it comes to representation. If Disney puts you in a movie, that means ""you made it"". Well, no. It doesn't. Disney will put a black person front and center in their ads and doing absolutely nothing with them (Star Wars). Disney will egg on articles about how a character will be gay but that's not even a part of the story (Beauty and the Beast). They are only okay with minorities insofar as they can manipulate them into going to see their garbage. If you want true, real minority representation, you need to let Disney go. They are not on your side. Other creators are making enormous strides in representation that you're unaware of because Black Panther is more fun to watch than Moonlight.",o262wm,"Disney effectively has a monopoly on the entertainment industry. As such, the decisions they make directly influence the views of everyone.

I should stop hiring from college that do not use SAT scores,"The trendy new thing seems to be to remove merit as a qualification because it is racist. I'm not here to debate that.

For reference 
https://edsource.org/2020/university-of-california-must-stop-all-use-of-sat-and-act-in-admissions-judge-orders/639499

As an employer, I want to hire the best within my budget. I know college does not teach anything directly relevant to what the job I'm hiring for does, and I know most learning will be on the job. I believe that good test scores are a proxy for a candidate's ability to learn on the job. I believe good test scores show that a candidate is willing to devote time and effort into a goal.

If a college is choosing to not use merit for acceptance, I don't see why it is a good idea to hire anyone from that school. I don't see a reason to even look at candidate resumes from that school. In fact, I see a reason to actively disqualify candidates who went to that school. A high GPA from the school does not strike me as meaningful when the school is not merit based.

I see this as a school that just wishes to enroll more students and receive more tuition than a school which cares about educating it students.",nek1vc,"1.First of all, getting rid of SATs does not mean admissions to college is not a merit-based system.

There is no need to abolish the sexualization of fictional characters.,"(First, I want to apologize for being my third post in a row about this topic, but the first time I hadn't gotten an adequate response and the second time my title was unsatisfactory, so I had to change it. I would like to thank the moderators for giving me an example of how I should word my titles so I can continue to word them correctly in future posts)

&amp;#x200B;

With both sides of the political party clamoring for control of every single facet of life, how the entertainment media conducts itself has been a rather hot topic as of late, with many individuals on the liberal side claiming that representation of minorities is vital to society while both sides agree that the sexualization of characters, mainly female, is a behavior that needs to be abolished. Initially, this was a notion that I agreed with, but as more and more time passed and I've become further engrossed in my own writing, I've come to disagree with this assessment for many reasons, all of which I will detail further in the post.

One common reason you see people clamoring for the de-escalation of sexualized character is that they set unrealistic beauty standards. In my eyes, this notion couldn't be any more false than it already is because all media aside from non-fictional material are always designed with some sort of fantastical element, even when fantasy isn't an explicit genre in the work, various works of medium stem from imagination, meaning that some of the depictions in said works can be quite unrealistic, and that isn't a problem. As someone who indulges in a fantastical kink, I see it as only natural that some characters, mainly female, to be given lavish proportions, especially if the genre is geared more towards a more sexual tone. What I am trying to get at here is that since all fictional work stems from imagination, characters are subject to tinkering, tampering, and being played with however the creator wills. And just because I prefer my fictional woman to be stacked in assets and be perfectly fine with no issues whatsoever doesn't mean I am looking for identical qualities in a real life woman, I understand that my preferences in media can't be applied to real life or that could be a recipe for disaster. The same could be said for men who are sexualized such as being ripped beyond belief and possess insane levels of masculinity: I love these characters, and while I do understand the necessity of fitness and good health, I'm not boggled by ideas of how to look in comparison to someone who is a figment of imagination.

""But what of anime?"" I predict many inquiring, which can be a fair assessment as Japanese media in general is notorious for sexualizing girls who are still in their early to mid teens, Horikoshi an excellent example of this as he is commonly lambasted on the Internet for many of his characters being school-aged and yet are still subject to sexualization, Momo a prime example. And even here, I have to disagree because for one, a lot of these complaints seem to stem from a Western audience where the age of consent is typically 18, or at the very least in America, but Japan is not boggled by such stipulations as the average age of consent in Japan is 13 with the age fluctuating in different regions, some sections of Tokyo even bumping the age to engage in sexual activity to be 16 to 18 years old, but even then, some of these characters are well within the law of Japan. And to further my point, these teenagers are rarely the center of sexual activity such as intimate intercourse or others, just that their assets are a bit exaggerated. And even fan-arts of these characters that originate in America are fine in my eyes as the character still hails from a Japanese setting, and as long as the website itself doesn't have any guidelines against this sort of artwork, it is also fine in my eyes.

So that is the basic gist of what I'm trying to convey that the sexualization of characters in media isn't an issue to begin with because, with the exception of non-fiction, all fiction are inherently fantastical and are figments of imagination, and as long as the country of origin doesn't have laws against it, it is still fine.

I would love to see if people can change my ideas on this matter.",hu0gu4,"So, just to clarify your view: do you, personally, think the current amount of sexualization of (specifically) women in media is:

1) Too much.

2) About right.

3) Not enough.

Because ""abolishing"" it really isn't an agenda that anyone has. Most people think that women are *oversexualized* in the media, and that this has negative effects on them in society, not that sex has no place in media.",fykv8sp
Incels aren't the product of toxic masculinity,"Edit: I am glad I was able to spark discussion! I got a few insights into this topic that I haven't seen before, namely my conflation of ""masculinity being toxic"" as opposed to ""toxic masculinity."" I'm gonna tap out of the conversation because now I am at work and I dont want my phone to blow up. Have a great day :)


But rather, they are the product of the lack of masculinity in general.

Let's take the most infamous example, Elliot Rodger. He had relatively good looks, he had money and status, but he was by no means a masculine man. In fact, he was so passive that his 'tactic' of trying to pick up girls was to rent a limousine, crash a party, and hang out outside of the party.

Elliot, and by extension Incels, have the same issue as ""Nice Guys"" in that they want to reverse the roles of society. They want women to approach them like how men have  approached  women.

Why is it that the answer to incels is to 'Man up!' And 'work on yourself first'? This is because the problem with incels is that they see the system of making themselves attractive to women as toxically masculine, and think that adopting a less masculine approach is the way to go.",dxlnqq,"Part of toxic masculinity is men and women shaming men for being virgins, do you not think virgin shaming men is part of the reason incels exist?",f7uprv9
Jury duty is a burden not a privilege,"I'm on the mindset that the court, the lawyers, the defence, all involved should be grateful I took time out of my life and showed up to the voir dire in the first place. Only to be questioned and judged by perhaps some of the more morally questionable people in the world to see if I'm a good fit for their case. 

If I can invoke my right to remain silent as a juror I would and if that meant my dismissal, then I say you should have given me the right of refusal in the first place.

It's the judicial system that needs jurors, not the other way around. 

Imo there should be 1. a minimum level of education required (ie assuming if one has attended university, then one most likely has critical thinking) 2. open tribunal where anyone who qualifies, wishes to, can participate. 3. Award the jurors for their fair participation.",rxwv2p,"Out of 32 million people chosen yearly for Jury Duty, only about 8 million actually end up showing up in person, and of those 8 million only about 1.5 million get chosen to be on a Jury. And of those cases, the vast majority are about 2-3 days. 

So in reality, your chance of being called to Jury Duty is only about 12% on any given year. And should you be called, there's then only a 4% chance you'll actually have to serve. And serving would only involve a few days in most cases. 

While, yes, serving any amount of time could be a burden for some people, those people already can get out of it by arguing an exception. But for everybody else, they're just lazy and entitled people who don't want to spend a single ounce of effort to participate in their society. Which is OK to be, just don't complain about it online and claim the entire system needs to be changed as a result.",hrm98ka
Cheating should not go unpunished unless the cheater accepted that what they did was wrong.,"I’ve just been reading some posts that say you should just leave the cheater, or that that itself is the punishment. I mean it could be the punishment if their intention was stay with you, that they needed you.

I’m really thinking of the cheaters who just don’t care about you. Who get tired of you then move onto the next person, then cheat on them, and so on. Maybe they just don’t care about staying with one person. Maybe they just want to get what they can from you then move on. But then you could question why they even needed to cheat. Why not just leave you first? But if they leave you, then they will be single. The assumption is they always need someone, but they don’t need any one person specifically. 

“By punishing them, you’re stooping to their level.” I’ve heard and followed that before. So just forget about them and let them be someone else’s problem? I mean, maybe it’s that it’s not worth your time to punish them, that their not worth it. I guess that could be the case. But that’s not saying that they don’t deserve to be punished.

Here’s my scenario: my ex girlfriend was cheating on me. Well, actually, first she was cheating on her boyfriend of 6 years with me. But I didn’t know about him. As soon as I found out, I ended it. But she messaged me that she didn’t want him anymore, that she wanted me. She then sent me a text stating that he was trying to suffocate her. Apparently he did this because he was mad at her for talking to me. I show up and have the landlord kick him out of her place. Well, I get back with her because she apparently still loved me. We’re dating for some time, then I find out she’s talking to another guy. This pissed me off. I didn’t want be with her anymore, but I felt like she deserved some sort of consequence for her actions. I didn’t react violently like her ex. I knew her Facebook password, so I logged in and made a post talking about what she’s done. She called me psycho crazy, that I went too far. I will admit that what I did could be considered immature, but only if there was another option. I couldn’t think of anything else, at least not at the time.",gkop88,"There is a way to “punish” cheating under certain circumstances.

Furthermore, a pan is infinitely easier to clean than a waffle iron, just a quick wipe off does the job as opposed to needing to dig the grease out of every notch on the iron.",fq9m2t7

We should not forgive student debt.,"Title. As I understand it, you borrow money, you go to school, get and education, you get a job with that higher education, and you pay back that debt and then some. Hundreds of thousands people forgo a higher education to not go into debt. I sit fairly left and I'm educated and believe in social reform, but student debt forgiveness seems unfair to me. I understand that it could ""revitalize"" the economy but I feel like that's a cheap way of saying ""we just don't wanna pay it back because we want to buy other stuff"". It's a calculated risk that you agree on, so why should that just go away? I can't just spend thousands on my credit card and then say ""now I want this forgiven"".  I'm willing to do a small amount of back and forth here but I expect more than a few responses and will read as much of it as possible, excuse me if I don't get to you. I will take some time to mull over carefully answers I think are worth a delta because I don't want give them out willy-nilly. The system might not be the best but you AGREED to it already. Why should you get to just not pay back what you owe?

Edit: lots of great responses, I'm currently going over some of the ones that most got me thinking. I do believe I'll be awarding a delta but I just need a little time to process what I read and learned and to decide which person or people will get it. While I don't think that Ive yet (at least as I write this, much more to go) found the answer I was looking for, there were plenty comments that still taught me something.

Ill update with any revelations I've had as soon as I can.


Edit dos : well I gave out some deltas! Took a bit and lot of different people's ideas to form an answer my reasoning is basically that while really can't fix the unfairness of the situation at least this fixes ""something"".

The Golden Girls Theme song was all wrong for the show,"The song that says “Thank you for being a friend….you’re a pal and a confidante” leads in to canned laughter over old ladies roasting each other viciously. I mean it’s hilarious, and I get that they’re cohabitants, but there’s way too much slut-shaming of Blanche (even self roasts; those are rare) to be the heartfelt show the song alludes to. (I think I used that right this time.)

Estelle Getty’s character always calls out her own daughter for being an asexual Neanderthal (not a direct quote, but definitely in the vein of her quips). All the things that people like about the show, all the grabbers, are not like the show’s theme song at all. 

Don’t get me wrong;I’m not saying that the old bags don’t have their touching moments, but the crux of what the show really is, the shows true identity, doesn’t match the theme song at all. Imagine if I were a hacksaw Jim Dugan style wrestler with the American flag, and my entry song, instead of Thank God I’m a Country Boy or something like that it was Lip Gloss.

The show didn't need a typical theme song; it needed *ominous chanting*. The idea that your closest friends are also your tormentors is an interesting observation and making it the subject matter of a banal sitcom rather than a French play is a neat idea, but the show really could have used a little something extra to drive the point home.

Ominous chanting to open and close the show would have been much more effective in making the point that this wasn't just old-age Facts of Life, it was an american *No Exit.*",h2c3vfb
Big Bird would beat Barney the Dinosaur in a street fight.,"Big Bird is based on the meadow lark bird whereas, Barney is based on a Tyrannosaurs. This may seem like Big Bird would be at a serious disadvantage. However, Big Bird will take the win as I will showcase with some points. 

1. Big Bird has the larger stature (8 feet two inches) vs Barney’s 6 feet.

2. Big Bird has large, powerful long legs giving him a serious distance advantage over the purple tyrant. Who’s small stubby arms will never be able to reach far enough to land a hit. 

3. Big bird’s sharp beak can poke Barney’s eyes out before he gets a chance to retaliate. 

4. Assuming we can have outsiders interrupt the fight. Big Bird has the larger crew for backup. Approximately 22 versus Barney’s two or so.

5. Barney is too old to put up a fight. He is approximately 66 million years old by present day. 

4. Despite his Carnavoric appearance, Barney’s mouth is flat and has no sharp teeth. Almost as if he was a herbivore. Making his teeth useless in combat scenario.

5. Now, here is Barney’s biggest weakness. He can only be summoned through a child’s imagination. This is proven within the show and it’s theme song. Barney is merely a stuffed toy until children come within his vicinity.  

Using this exploit, Big bird merely needs to stomp the nearest child with his large powerful legs. This will render the child unconscious who was summoning him. This will send Barney back to his toy form making this an easy victory for our yellow feathered friend. 

The letter of the day is: S for Stomp. Which is what Big Bird will be doing over Barney’s corpse.",jf2jhh,"Big bird only has one good arm, because the other arm is the mouth.",g9i6tkf
The second amendment is more pertinent to the liberty to defend one's self than it is to defend the state from tyranny,"The second amendment states the following

""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.""

I've seen some discussions on reddit specifically that question the second amendment's ability to actually defend what many would consider a free state. For example, several people cite the insurrection in the Capitol on the 6th as an example of the second amendment actually supporting the destruction of a free state. 

However, i argue that the second amendment only partial is relevant to the defense of a free state. I argue it is more in support of personal defense than it is of the defense of a free state.  In our fore father's time, i think the defense of the state was a more important right. However, today, America has shown to be a relatively stable state. It's defense is not something we consider a necessity. 

All that being said, it begs the question, why is the second amendment so important in today's America? 

America has always touted itself as the freest nation in the world. My rational is if we are free, then why wouldn't we be free to defend ourselves with the best means necessary?  2020 was a shit year, and it also saw record gun purchases by new gun owners.  I attribute this to the civil unrest that was prevalent throughout 2020. 

If the second amendment has less pertinence to the defense of a free state, then what is it's use?  It's most pertinent definition is to that of the right to personal defense. Change my view.",kz9zju,"My problem with this take is not that I disagree with it on a fundamental level, more so that if the government truly did become tyrannical people owning guns in the US wouldn't change that.

The United States two party system is an illusion of democracy and basically the closest you can get to dictatorship without a dictator,"I so often hear Americans declare the United States the greatest democracy on earth and get confused. How can a system where you only get to choose from two real alternatives be anything but an illusory democracy?

Phone manufacturers should be required to include basic features/functions.,"On September 7^th , 2016 Apple announced that it would not be including a 3.5mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. This was disappointing for many, but Apple included a 3.5 mm to Lightning adapter in the box, along with a pair of ear buds that connected via Lightning. This solution was sufficient for most people.

However, with the release of the iPhone X, they stopped including that 3.5 mm to Lightning adapter. They only included the Lightning ear buds.

With the release of Google's Pixel 4, they didn't include audio equipment in the box, and charge $30 for a pair of USB-C earbuds (which only work with the Pixel). I fear that Apple is headed in the same direction.

Both companies as well as Samsung launched expensive wireless earbuds around the time that they cut the headphone jack, making it quite obvious that this was motivated by profit. But what about the consumer? This pretty much screws the consumer over. They can spend $30 for a pair of earbuds, then if you break/loose them can you go to Walmart and get a pair of earbuds for $3? No, because they won't work because conveniently your phone has no headphone jack.

Selfless Acts Do Not Exist,"A selfless act is defined as an act with no benefits for the individual who performs them but is beneficial to other individuals. However, I feel like there is no such thing as a truly altruistic and selfless action. Acts like helping a stranger with their groceries, volunteering at a food shelter, or donating to charity are all acts people like to describe as selfless and altruistic. These actions make you feel better about yourself and make other people see you in a better light, don’t they? Which implies a benefit to the individual who performs them. Helping a neighbor or a friend makes your friendship grow stronger and makes the other person more likely to return the favor. 

I’m not saying people who act selflessly are only thinking about how it’ll benefit them. They probably do believe they are being selfless and kind, but in the end, they are still benefiting from that act. Why else would do these things and encourage them, it’s illogical. Our society looks favorably on selfless acts for a reason, they help encourage cooperation between people. I have never seen a selfless act that didn’t, in some roundabout way, benefit both parties and I just feel like selflessness doesn’t exist.",f4kiyt,"&gt;A selfless act is defined as an act with no benefits for the individual who performs them but is beneficial to other individuals.

Under that definition you might be right, but I think the more generally accepted solution is that the act is driven by desire to help others, and that it does help others more than yourself.

Organized crime is greatly exaggerated in media has almost no semblance to reality in the US.,"The Godfather. Breaking Bad. Better Call Saul. Scarface. The Sopranos. 

There are many great American movies and shows that depict corporate-like organized crime. It is my belief that this is not how it works, at least in the United States.


In the United States, if you get caught even selling a small portion of drugs, your life is over. In the movies, you see these heads of these criminal organizations, and they carry themselves like typical CEOs. They wear suits and they appear to be very intelligent and well-versed in business practices. 

But someone that intelligent knows about risk versus reward. Someone that intelligent has the capacity to get a legitimate job, making legitimate money. 

Yes, there are crime organizations in the US. Even ones that can be called organized. But in my opinion, the personnel in these organizations are not competent enough to do legitimate business. Therefore, people who participate in criminal businesses like drug trafficking/dealing, are typically not very intelligent. Because if they were, they would understand a simple concept of risk versus reward. And then they would quickly determine that it is absolutely not worth the risk to do that job.

Not to mention the war on drugs which I totally disagree with. But nonetheless, the USA, the richest country in the world, dedicates an insane amount of money to the war on drugs. Federal agents and law-enforcement have an abundance of resources, all dedicated to catching drug dealers. And there’s this misconception that the DEA does not care about small time dealers. That’s not true at all. If they get a tip that someone is selling drugs, even if it’s a small amount, they will absolutely execute a search warrant. Even if they find a small amount, they consider that a win. And they have nearly unlimited money to do so.

Anyone with average intelligence would know this and was not even consider getting into the illegal drug trade. Therefore, I believe that people who get into the illegal drug trade are either stupid or addicted to drugs themselves. This caricature of a suit and tie drug dealer like Gus Fring is a fantasy. And if you disagree with me, please find me a real life scenario where someone like Gus Fring actually existed.

Also, I find the, “you don’t know of any real life Gus Frings because they don’t get caught” argument to be weak and lazy.

If you are in a position that you would rather cut ties than help your boyfriend/girlfriend through a tough diagnosis, then if you were shamed into staying it would only harm the relationship further and it would be harder to deal with down the road for both parties.

Mass transportation should be free at point of entry in large cities,"Note: Free at point of entry meaning no fares/tickets.  The system would be paid for by the residents of the city, passenger or not.

The person who benefits from mass transportation is the passenger.  This seems like an obvious and indisputable premise.  And so it seems to make sense to charge a fare so that passengers pay for the bulk (or the entirety) of the cost of running a mass transportation system.

But I don't think that's true.  In many large cities (the New Yorks, the Chicagos, the Londons and Tokyos), the city *cannot function* unless people use mass transportation.  It's simply impossible to move the number of people that need to be moved without a mass transportation system.  

In that way, mass transportation is much closer to police services (city-wide charge) than something like water (charge per unit consumed).  Even though some people might ""consume"" police or fire services more than others, we recognize that metered (or fared) consumption is a poor way to distribute costs for that kind of city service.  

Another way to think about it.  One way to allocate costs is by allocating it on the entities that impose the cost.  If you use a lot of water the city will charge you more because you impose a greater cost than someone who draws less water.  if you consumed less water then you would be charged less.  If everyone consumed less (or opted out completely, maybe a private water supplier), then the city could scale back its system and spending.

Suppose *every* subway and bus passenger in Chicago decided to take an Uber (private provider of transportation).  Would this increase or decrease the cost to the city of providing transportation?  I argue that it would massively increase costs to the point of failure for the city.  Why would users switching away from a city service *increase* costs to the city?  Because the users are providing a *benefit* to the city by taking mass transportation (generally speaking).

Not all mass transportation use benefits the city.  But the system as a whole is so critical to the functioning of a large city that I think it's incorrect to place the burden of maintaining the system on the subset of the population who aren't fortunate enough to be able to opt out of it (such as by driving, or living near more expensive commercial centers).",bwr7j5,"1. A substantial number of people, especially on trains, use public transportation by choice and can easily afford to pay for it. I make less then $100,000 a year, should my taxes go to letting someone making $500,000 a year ride for free? If people are too poor to afford transit there's other programs to help that are or can be done short of letting everyone just ride for free. 
2. If transit is free, there's no incentive to not misbehave or to use it for purposes other than transit. If you smoke, spit, or act rowdy on the bus you get thrown off and you loose your bus fare. But if transit is free you just hop on the next bus and continue smoking.Even worse, if transit is free it becomes a place for people to sit down and misbehave and act rowdy even if they have not interest in actually going where the bus is.",eq3ctc3
All forms of monetary penalties should be based on the persons income,"For example: Why should I pay the same amount of money for speeding as another person who earns 10x more money, than I do.  

Isn't the whole reason for montery punishment, to make the person feel the impact of his/hers wrongdoing?

Someone who earns just 1k a month will no doubt feel the impact, paying a third of his salary for one illegal action.

Senior citizens (65+) should be required to retake the driving test periodically,"The title basically says it all. I don’t have an exact number as to how frequently they should have to retake the test (maybe once every 2 years?), but I think something needs to be done. I don’t remember the exact statistic, but I remember seeing a sign in the DMV that said something along the lines of “a teen texting and driving has the same reaction time as an 80 year old.” That’s crazy. You’re telling me that an 80 year old has the same/similar reaction time as someone who’s not even looking at the road half the time?? The teen can put the phone away but an 80 year old can’t stop being old. These people took the driving test so long ago, it’s surprising to me this isn’t already a law. Cars have changed a lot since the 50’s, as has the amount of people on the roads. Also, some of these elderly folks could be suffering from some sort of degenerative disease that could greatly affect their response time and overall competency level. In my personal experience, individuals with dementia or Alzheimer’s are typically unaware or in denial of their condition, and will continue to drive despite obviously lacking the skills to do so safely and effectively. Requiring them to retake the exam periodically would likely result in fewer accidents, as well as ensure their safety.",cqkj2p,Bump it up to 75. Most 65 year olds can still hold their own,ewzez3t
The customers are never at fault for buying plastic products,"This naturally covers the whole ""Plastic Straws"" movement

It is my view that ""Plastic Straws"" movement is neither grassroots nor actually care about the environment, rather it's a front for companies to remove their responsibility of cleaning up the environment, and a distraction from the rest of the industry. Why?  


1. The actual problem is plastic trash aren't processed correctly. The duty of a customer is limited to, and only to, **putting their trash in the correct trash bins**. Where the trash ends up is trash processing problem, not customer problem. Trash processing companies make a profit processing trash, *they* should do their job.
2. There are people who throw trash away. The correct movement is to make them stop doing that, not blaming people for using plastic straws
3. The amount of plastic a straw has is minuscule compared to the amount of plastic used for quite literally anything else: plastic bottles, plastic boxes, plastic wrapper, clothes, etc. 
4. The plastic trash was not created the moment a customer buys it. **The trash was created the moment it's produced**. Once a plastic bottle has been created and filled with soda, it does not matter a single iota whether somebody buys it or not, there already exists a plastic bottle that will be sent to trash bins. Same with plastic wrappers
5. Ergo, it is not a customer's duty to stop purchasing plastic products, **it is companies' duty to stop producing plastic products**.
6. Furthermore, **companies literally spend billions upon billions of dollars on** researching and **publishing** **ads** that will instill a subconscious desire in customers to purchase those plastic products. 

All those points means: blaming customers for using plastic products is morally bankrupt. 

Note: I intentionally leave out plastic bags out of this, because I agree we should not use plastic bags",kqrg4i,"A market only exists to satisfy the consumer. A customer wants a sugary drink or a water that they can grab and drink without having to clean or carry their own receptacle. Same concept with plastic grocery bags... you want something easy to carry but don't want to invest in reusable bags. You want to grab a soda at a drive through and want a lid and straw because you don't want to spill and don't want to wash and provide your own reusable straw.

This demand is met by supply. You're blaming the supplier and removing all blame from the demander which is absolutely ridiculous. Consumers COULD change the market, but they don't. The responsibility is not all on the manufacturers. Responsibility is held on both sides.",gi6wzxk
It would be impossible to upload a persons mind to a computer or artificial brain.,"I see this in science fiction and sometimes discussions about the future of human evolution.  Sometimes it's presented as a digital afterlife.

I think it is impossible no matter how far we advance technologically for the following reasons.

1) Consciousness is an emergent property of our brains.  I realize that the nature of consciousness is still a big philosophical and scientific question mark but we do know that changing our brains deliberately or accidentally can also change things like personality, perception, just about anything that we may think makes us our selves.

2) the only thing that would behave exactly like a specific neuron is that specific neuron.  A simulated neuron or artifical neuron would not be able to behave **exactly** the same way.  Perhaps a reasonable approximation would be possible but over time the behaviour of that artifical neuron would diverge from that of the original.

3) Based on 1 and 2 a brain composed of simulated or artificial neurons would be have differently over time from the original brain.  This would result in a similar but essentially different person.

4) Even if it were somehow possible to overcome these obstacles you would essentially be making a copy of yourself that would go on living/thinking regardless of whether or not the original person was destroyed in the process.

I would like my view changed because I love some of the ideas I see but can't imagine a way we could overcome these problems.

"If I have to intentionally hide a true fact about myself in order to stay friends with someone, we aren’t honest friends.","Long story short, I’ve known a girl for some time now who has become my friend. What she doesn’t know, is that I was in love with her (or to be fair, the idea of her) from the first moment I saw her. When I met her however, she actually turned out to truly be that idea I had of her and more, in every way. No women has come close to making me feel the way she does to this day.

We hung out casually a few times and had an amazing time together, but when I asked her on a date, I found out she lately started seeing someone. She also expressed the she wants to stay friends; I genuinely want to as well. I have done all I can to temporarily distance myself, meet other women, and in general move on from the incredibly strong feelings I had mostly by realizing that she probably doesn’t feel the same way. I’ve mostly moved on but am left facing the following moral dilemma:

If we are truly going to be friends going forward, should I be honest with this girl about the way I used to feel about her? I’ve thought about this question a lot, and have come to the following conclusion:

A friendship based on the intentional omission of true information that would otherwise ruin the friendship is not an honest friendship; I can’t know if telling her a true piece of information would ruin our friendship until I actually tell her. Because it’s reasonable to assume it could, if I want any chance at an honest friendship, I have to tell her about the way I used to feel, even if it’s not in full detail, so long as she understands the basic truth. As it currently stands, all I’ve done is casually ask her out on a date one time; while she can reasonably assume I liked her, she has no way of knowing the feelings I had were so strong that no other women had ever made me feel the same way.

I think an important distinction to make here is that im not saying a friend is only an honest friend if you can say anything to them (ex: tell them off or insult them for no reason) and still be friends, but what I am saying is that a friend is not a real friend if I have to intentionally hide a true fact about myself in order to maintain that friendship; it’s not a friendship based in reality. When it comes to the good friends I already have, there isn’t anything I could tell them about myself or what I think about them that would ruin our friendship.

Mass shooters of today are the same people who would've been serial killers in the 80s,"There were 198 serial killers active in the United States in 1987. In 2019, there were only 2 active serial killers. [Source](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/serial-killings-are-waning-leading-to-speculation-about-the-cause)

I was amazed when I read this - I had no idea that serial killing was so prevalent in the 80s, and I had no idea that it was so rare now. There's been a 99% decline in active serial killers!

The article mentions many potential explanations for this decline: access to porn is satisfying would-be killers urges, people don't hitchhike anymore, cameras are everywhere, DNA evidence exists, etc.

But the explanation that I find the most realistic, which is mentioned in the article, is that would-be serial killers are instead performing mass shootings. By the numbers, mass shooters have basically replaced serial killers.

And I think it makes sense because it's basically the only way to be a serial killer now without quickly getting caught. Because of the other reasons mentioned (cameras, DNA, etc) it's way harder to kill a bunch of people over a long period of time. So the only way to do it now is to kill a bunch of people at once.",n4fvxg,"People who commit mass shootings, at least the lone wolf types, generally want to die.

"It will be impossible to eliminate systemic racism without creating a dystopian, authoritarian, totalitarian society in which none of us would want to live.","At its core systemic racism simply means that disparities exist between racial or ethnic groups. It can be anything. Incarceration, wealth accrual, academic performance, representation in certain careers, the rate of getting pulled over by police, etc. The idea is that these disparities are driven by policies and laws and social attitudes that need not actually even mention race or have any racist intent to be systemically racist. For an example, if the law says that you can't drive over 65mph on a freeway, and X racial demographic tends to speed more often than other racial groups resulting in them getting pulled over for speeding more often then the existence of that disparity and likely the law itself would be considered systemic racism. 

Before you accuse me of strawmanning, allow me to share some quotes. These are from Ibram X. Kendi's *How to be an Antiracist;* Kendi is an academic and activist widely regarded as one of the preeminent ""woke"" voices of the modern era, and *Antiracist,* where these quotes were taken from, was lauded as one of the best commentaries on issues like systemic racism and spent over a year and a half of the NYT bestseller list - my point being that the views I'm about to quote are thoroughly mainstream: 

&gt;One either allows racial inequities to persevere, as a racist, or confronts racial inequities, as an antiracist. There is no in-between safe space of “not racist.” The claim of “not racist” neutrality is a mask for racism. 

... 
&gt;The defining question is whether the discrimination is creating equity or inequity. If discrimination is creating equity, then it is antiracist. If discrimination is creating inequity, then it is racist. 

To summarize, Kendi's view (and therefore much of the mainstream woke view) on this topic is that the existence of any disparity along racial lines is inherently racist regardless of the reason behind the disparity, that any failure to be actively trying to create perfect racial equity is inherently racist, and that we aren't just justified but morally obligated to engage in racial discrimination to go about fixing these disparities. Again, this is a fairly mainstream take on the issue of systemic racism. 

The issue is as I see it that in a country like my own, insanely diverse with 325,000,000 people and about a zillion different historical, cultural, economic, social, political, biological, etc. factors influencing every outcome, there are many, many different racial disparities that would need to be addressed, and while I can see how we could promote *equality* and let that be good enough without creating a dystopia, I dont see how we could maintain perfect *equity* without getting very dystopian. 

Let's take a trivial example: the NBA. There are obvious racial disparities in the NBA. Per the wiki on the topic: ""the NBA in 2020 was composed of 74.2 percent black players, 16.9 percent white players, 2.2 percent Latino players of any race, and 0.4 percent Asian players."" So basically there is no racial group for which NBA representation even vaguely resembles national racial demographics. Per the earlier definitions this makes the NBA systemically racist, and we must seek to rectify this racism, perhaps using proactive racial discrimination, lest we ourselves be labeled racists. But how? It strikes me that there are basically two ways to go about it. Either we can engage in broad social engineering to try to promote the popularity of basketball among non black demographics while simultaneously reducing its popularity among black demographics, which seems like it would be a near impossible and neverending balancing act, or we can simply enact racial quotas, i.e. ""sorry sir, you're the most qualified person to be on our team, but unfortunately we hit our X.X% quota for people of your skin color and are only looking for people of a different skin color to hit our Y.Y% quota for another race."" 

Or you can do both. 

Now multiply that effort across the zillion different racial disparities that exist in this country and hopefully you'll see what I mean when I say its starting to look pretty dystopian. Solving racial disparities seems to involve meddling with free choice and agency and culture down to an insanely personal level, and obviously enacting racial quotas on literally everything in society doesn't seem much better. To make matters worse, you'd sometimes need to artificially compensate for biology - racial demographics have different hormones, heights, and propensities to attract different diseases, but if any disparate outcome relating to Healthcare or longevity exists its racist and must be corrected, so how do we go about solving that? If one racial group is more prone to a particular kind of cancer on a biological level but we can't have any disparity in outcomes of treatment due to the need to eliminate systemic racism, do we just... give better treatment to people of that race? Give worse treatment to people of other races? Is it a quota thing? ""Sorry sir, we'd treat your cancer but we need X.X% more people in your demographic to die from cancer this quarter in order to not be systemically racist?"" 

I feel like I've given enough examples as to why this effort to eliminate systemic racism and achieve exact racial parity in everything seems bound to produce a very dystopian society in which none of us would want to live. Id love to hear your thoughts, particularly on if there's some other way to achieve this equity thats not dystopian.",lfoths,"I think you are being a bit too specific about the definition of systemic racism and Kendi's work.  It's not that every instance of racial disparities is itself enough to prove systemic racism.  It's that when you take everything in totality, those disparities overwhelming favor certain races over others.  The goal isn't to get to a point where every health measure has the exact same impact on people of every race.  Or that certain jobs that are easier to do with certain physical characteristics should be given equitably to people whether they have that characteristic or not.  The point is that when it comes to overall health and wealth, there are glaring disparities across racial lines and that dealing with those broader disparities is the point of anti-racist work.  

No one is advocating anything close to some sort of ridiculous system of racial death quotas.  But, what they are saying is that the fact that Black folks have worse health outcomes is a combination or prioritizing capitalism/profit over community health, focusing research and investment in health issues that impact white folks more than Black folks, and that wealth inequality makes it much more likely that a health emergency will be a life changing event for a Black person than it is for a white person.  So, when trying to come up to solutions to problems around health care, the focus should be more on closing health outcomes and less on continuing to prioritize the ideals of free market or what health issues Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg feel like investing in.",gmn02ye
The constant focus on groups or classes labeled as minority only exacerbates the ill effects of prejudice and discrimination.,"Acknowledging, celebrating, or otherwise reinforcing the perception that a particular group is a minority and/or otherwise disadvantaged, however well-intentioned, is counterproductive to the intended goal of realizing equality.
   
Those in the minority group are inclined to consider themselves disadvantaged which inevitably leads to the emotional response to ""fight"" for equality.  Similarly, those that do not belong to the minority group are influenced - even motivated to falsely consider themselves superior thus leading to an emotional response of keeping ""them"" in their place.

There most certainly are groups of us that are disadvantaged and discriminated against in society today, whether that is based on religion, color of our skin, sexual orientation, etc.
 
The real question is: How do we stop perpetuating the idea of ""us vs. them"" when there is so much emphasis on celebrating the diversity/differences between us, who, after all are all just humans on a rock flying through space.",lhb08d,"Minorities that actually need and deserve protection aren't in that position by choice.

Besides that, much of what you stated can be nitpicked and challenged, including ""constant"", ""emotional response"", ""fight inequality"". It's not about making minorities feel like the majority does, it's about making their differences irrelevant towards their social participation and positioning.

Free countries should give open immigration rights to Hongkongers.,"Given the progressively deteriorating human rights situation in Hong Kong, I think it would be beneficial in both a humanitarian and long-term national interest manner for free countries to open their borders to Hongkongers as refugees.

The humanitarian argument is the easiest one to make - it is obviously beneficial to people to give them more choice in where to live.  I am not saying anyone should be forced to leave Hong Kong.  Rather, there should be an option for those who want to leave.

I think as far as national interest for free countries, there are two dimensions on which this policy is beneficial.

First, it provides a means of checking Chinese power via a passive policy choice.  It is not a hostile act to grant visas, and the PRC government can't retaliate in kind because a free country doesn't see a right or ability to emigrate as a threat in the way a totalitarian state does.  It is a non-violent and non-escalatory means by which free countries can actually ""do something"" about the Hong Kong situation.

Second, in the long run attracting freedom-seeking people from a vibrant market economy is extremely economically beneficial.  The sort of people who will self-select to emegrate from Hong Kong given the opportunity are likely to be especially entrepreneurial and ambitious and valuable contributors to the society where they move.

I think the most obvious country to adopt this policy would be the UK as it is a treaty with them (the Joint Declaration) which the PRC is flouting in Hong Kong.  But it would be beneficial to virtually any free country.",gr0xba,It would be pretty hypocritical. There are a lot of places with bad stuff happening in the world.

It is impossible to generate a profit under capitalism without taking from another person.,"Revision: Profit is ONLY generated through the undervaluation and enforcement of negative externalities. Yes, that includes small fringe activities that depend on the major industrial profits to exist in society (moving the goalposts, but this is a living discussion). 

Edit: I'm here for a good discussion, which it has been so far. My perspective hasn't changed, but based on my premise, I had to give a delta since I said ""impossible"" and some fringe cases have been given, which I have considered but deemed irrelevant because of the scale of their impact, nor do those cases mention the social/economic medium in which they must exist which requires other industries that do take from others through un(der)paid externalities. I am looking for an economic perspective who can show that making a profit is possible without destroying the environment and killing/exploiting people.

I'm trying to work this out, and right now it's a bit of an Econ 101 perspective, so attack this argument please.

The crux of the argument is: the production and distribution process of materials/goods requires a negative externality which is not factored into the cost of production nor sale. If this cost were internalized, that is included in the production cost or in the sales cost and price, it would be impossible to generate profit.

A corollary is that those who assign a dollar-value cost to negative externalities are not those who experience the negative externality themselves, and thus the value of that negative externality is underestimated.

An example would be a production process which leads to the death of a child. What is the dollar-value of a human child's life? I would say that it approaches infinity, and the child themself, along with the parents have the same estimation. Therefore, a company which causes the death of a human child in its production or materials acquisition could never be profitable unless it decides on its own the cost of the human life, and assigns it a value which allows them to be profitable.

Edit: ""Impossible"" was a bit of a stretch, because as numerous CMVers have given fringe examples where there can be profit made without taking from other people, so they will get  ∆ 's even though I could come up with those examples myself and they don't change my view about the industrial production as a whole. There are also some divergent philosophical views between OP and the CMVers about life, value, and government which have not been resolved.

I accept that my premise was flawed and should have been more specific to the type of production and profit I believe is impossible, but that would be shifting the goalposts.

This case highlights an example of what I am talking about:

If the valuation of life is not decided by the people dying, and therefore will be underestimated to ensure profitability.

When it is non-American people in question, the value of their life is often estimated much cheaper (why is a child in New York more valuable than a child in Congo? For example, how many children have to die to ensure a supply of rare-earth metals to Apple? If the cost of these deaths were included in the costs Apple and consumers pay, then there is no way Apple could be a trillion-dollar company.).",ikra97,"I think you should start by studying Econ101, specifically the subjective theory of value. The conclusion is that 'surplus value' is a meaningless concept, if you include that in your definition of capitalism, your doing it all wrong.

Capitalism is somewhat undefined term, but generally it is understood as a system of reasonably free market with private ownership of means of production, private ownership of 'capital'. The definition of 'capital' is something that you do not consume immediately, but rather you postpone the consumption and use that for producing other things in the future.

For example: I spare some money, use it to learn being an architect, thus improving my human capital. You do the same, you become a good car mechanic. You also save some money and instead of going on vacation you buy a garage and some tools (physical capital). You want a new house, I need to have a car repaired - we strike a deal. I will create the architectonic design for your new home, you will fix my broken car.

I have traded my time and experience and now I have a fixed car. You have traded some energy, some parts and now you have a prepared project for your new home. I value the fixed car more than I value the lost time, you value the project more than your time, parts.

We both profit. No externality involved. This is not an edge case; this is the majority case.",g3ph9su
all criminal defendants should get the same quality lawyer (i.e. a public defender),"My reasoning is that the court proceedings represent a trade-off between the rights of the accused, and the right of the public to be protected from a criminal if they are guilty.  There is no reason why this trade-off should be more biased on favor of acquittal in the case where the defendant has money.

This is not the same thing as rich people having access to better doctors, better teachers, better food, etc.  It may be ""unfair"" that the rich have access to better versions of those things, but it's not actively making everyone else's lives \*worse\*.

In the case of a criminal trial, though, if you assume that giving someone an average-quality criminal defense attorney strikes the right balance between the rights of the accused and the rights of society, that means that a high-powered criminal defense attorney tips the balance too much toward acquittal, resulting in more guilty defendants going free and putting everyone else in danger.  There doesn't seem to be any logical or cost-benefit argument for why we should acquit rich people at a higher rate than poor people, in situations where all other circumstances are the same.

Instead, we could just give everyone a public defender.  (Whatever money people currently spend on private criminal defense attorneys, we could just tax people the same total amount, and the money goes into a fund for public defenders for everyone.)

At that point, you can calibrate the system to strike any balance you want between the rights of the accused and the rights of the public.  If you think public defenders are too ineffective at representing the rights of their clients against prosecutors, then you could give more money to public defenders -- or, if that's too expensive, you could also handicap the prosecutor's side, limiting what they can spend on each case.

There may be other approaches, but I submit that any solution should require that all defendants, rich or poor, get access to the same quality lawyer.  CMV.",dbp333,"\&gt; In the case of a criminal trial, though, if you assume that giving someone an average-quality criminal defense attorney strikes the right balance between the rights of the accused and the rights of society, 

Problem is, I don't assume that. Public defenders are often inadequate. 

\&gt; If you think public defenders are too ineffective at representing the rights of their clients against prosecutors, then you could give more money to public defenders  

It has been endlessly demonstrated that throwing more money at a problem isn't enough to solve it, and often even makes it worse by attracting graft. Public defenders face the fundamental problem of being a government institution that is, ostensibly, working against another government institution (the prosecution). But what are a public defender's real incentives here? A private lawyer who does a poor job of defending his clients won't get anymore clients. A public defender will be assigned to defendants whether he ever succeeds in competently defending them or not. 

And ""more money"" certainly isn't going to solve the problem of blatantly corrupt public defenders whose sympathies are entirely with the prosecution, such as we see in authoritarian regimes.

The ability to hire a lawyer whose interests are genuinely on the side of the defendant is far too important a check to be disregarded, and the right of any given individual to not be falsely imprisoned is more important than ""fairness"" in the sense of making sure that every individual has the same likelihood of being falsely imprisoned.

In practice, this might mean that people with means will have better legal representation, but neither denying them the right to a vigorous defense nor handicapping the prosecution in cases of a public defender in arbitrary ways leads to a lesser evil. Instead, we should be focusing on fighting against actual prosecutorial abuses. 

Think of it this way: when new consumer technologies come out, it's the rich who benefit first, since they can afford them. But by doings so, they provide the money needed to establish the market, which eventually benefits the poor when prices come down. Likewise, even if private defense lawyers benefit the rich first, they can still benefit poorer defendants as well by helping to keep the overall system more honest.",f23pnez
Bstroy's hoodies are art and the people who are outraged are unjustified.,"Context for those who don't know. A fashion brand, Bstroy, featured school hoodies with bullet holes in them from school that have had a mass shooting. They did this at a New York Fashion week show.

Everywhere I have seen this story, people have repeated that it was for profit. I've seen people say that Bstroy are just trying to be edgy or capitalise off school shootings. But I haven't actually seen any evidence for this.

What I have seen however is multiple statements from the designer that it was an artistic statement about gun violence and school shootings and that these items were never meant for sale.

My opinion is that every person who is outraged doesn't hold a valid reason to be outraged (at Bstroy). Either:

1. They don't believe it is art and believe it's for sale. In which they are wrong.
2. They acknowledge it's not for profit but just don't believe something so offensive should be allowed. In which I say that it's art and they should be directing their outrage at government inaction on gun control.

Just for clarification. I am not saying people aren't allowed to feel a certain way, just that it isn't always justified.",d6dr9g,"It's a good idea badly executed. 

Just because they aren't selling the items doesn't mean they aren't profiting off of them.

"marriage is outdated, and weddings are dumb.","I've been in love twice so far in life, they were both sincere, one completely trumped the other, but both were very real. 


I'd never get married, though. 


Marriage is bringing the state into your love life, it's weird. There was a time when this made sense, but even so, it really only made sense to people of royalty. 

Weddings are their own industry, are a lavish grandiose expression of what should be a more or less intimate feeling between two people in love. 

The white dress purity thing? Creepy. 

Diamond wedding/engagement rings? Lame, overpriced, and for those that know the whole story about why it's a diamond ring, like yeah, fuck that. 

Religious ties to your wedding? Weird (although, this is as a Westerner and an atheist, these are 2 big parts of why I'm willing to consider changing my view) 


The way that everyone acts when someone gets married is SO strange. It brings out the worst in people at times. Extended family tries to take control of the event, sometimes either the bride or groom will start to reveal ugly parts of their personality, it's just not wholesome. 


Anything that you benefit from (on paper) from marriage, there's usually another form that could be filled out, that, if ever nullified, would be nullified much easier than a divorce.

Which brings me to divorce, yuck. 

All in all, I think marriage is stupid. If you're in love, be in love! Why complicate it? Because marriage is so very complicated. 

I'd rather be old and still be with a ""girlfriend"" or ""partner"" or whatever than to have a wife. 

&amp; personally, I don't want to have kids, but, I don't think there should be the social pressure that you should have to be married to have a kid, if anything, a kid guarantees you'll stay together *way* more than marriage does. 

Anyways yeah marriage just seems super possessive, unnecessarily legally binding, and the ceremonies tend to bring out ugly parts of people's personalities. 

But, I could be wrong! 

(This isn't a bash on married people, it's just how I feel, if you're happily married I'm very happy for you)",ga8zk6,"The only thing that is dumb and outdated is the fact we continue to force-feed our children with this ridiculous pipe-dream of the ""PERFECT WEDDING"".

It's mostly theatrics. I love my Fiance, but we have to deal with this battle constantly. She is a traditionalist. I am a rebel. It's an on-going struggle. But I can't help but think of a million other ways to spend 30-50k - which actually yields you something more equitable or useful.

"nline Dating is a stilted, awkard way to meet people for romance purposes and only good for the desparate or people who only want casual sex.","The thought of using online dating to find an SO is an idea I find to be completely repulsive and weird.  For deltas try to soften my stance on my reasons for this. My reason for this is the following:

-Your profile is a CV: you know online dating takes the romance out of romance when it is frequently compared to applying for and interviewing for jobs.  So you write your resume and hope to get an interview for the job of ""girlfriend""?  Spicy!  And if I do really well I can be promoted to ""wife"" like I am working the corporate latter of dick!

-Its glorified mailorder: on the other side there is going through profiles of the gender(s) of choice looking at a bio I am not convinced people read and risky photos - the riskier the more likely of a right swipe (figuratively or literally depending on the site or app).  Talk about dehumanizing!

-Meeting with a random: so you eventual communicate with someone through a series of awkward flirting and then meet them in person to have more awkard socialization with a complete stranger.  Assuming no one is a creep you walk away feeling nothing - because 1 date isn't long enough to feel attraction or affection for anyone, and you are now stuck with the question of how many dates does it take before you realize you don't actually like this person and you wasted your time.

-Its backwards: I mean, when you meet people outside of the dating scene interactions are more natural and less stilted.  By no means is this a ""online interaction is not real"" cmv, I count meeting people in a chatroom or a mmorpg as real and outside the dating scene.  You also get to know the person so you know if you like them and if you are attracted to them.  Worst case if they don't reciprocate you can be friends.  Yeah!  Before someone says ""you can be friends with people you meet in online dating"" can I point out that telling someone ""I am not attracted to you but we can be friends"" is the worst thing you can say to someone matched in online dating?

-None of the above matters if you just want sex: if you only want casual, no strings attached sex you can meet others whom also want that.  Use the app, find a hottie who thinks your hot, meet and rump.  You aren't looking for romance or relationships, you just want to get off without masturbating.  Online dating is good for this and only this.

There are other issues (like grudge reporting by jilted user more upset they were rejected then anything else getting innocent users banned from the platform) but I feel those kinds of users are simple oversights on who runs the site and not fundamental problems with the concept.

I am wanting to change my mind on this as I just creeped out my lastest crush again, and people keep advising I get in on online dating.  I don't really want to for the reasons stated, and for the fact its signifying that I am a desparate loser that needs to force sex interactions to be in a commited relationship.  I want chemistry to develop naturally, and for the reasons I have stated I don't believe online dating facilitates this.

Change my view!",dhxu9c,"The only difference between online dating and real-world dating is the existence of a date zero. Normally, you have already seen the person and there's already a spark. With online dating, you need to see if that exists, so you meet in person. It's usually a little awkward, but it's nothing two adults can't handle. From that point forwards, it's exactly the same.",f3s1t85
I don't understand how raising the minimum wage to $15/hr would help anyone in the long term and yet it seems to be extremely popular.,"It seems to me that simple economics would dictate that paying the lowest paid workers more would not only dilute the value of the hourly wage for everyone else that ISN'T making minimum wage, but it would also lead to significantly higher business/labor costs for employers, thus forcing them to either raise prices of their goods/services to make for up the increase, or lay people off, cut hours, cut benefits, etc, or any combination of those things.

It seems to me like a significantly higher minimum wage would only be a bandaid for a year or less and then EVERYONE'S wages would be worth less. Help me understand why so many people are screaming about raising the minimum. Is there merit to this or are hordes of Occupy types just drinking the koolaid?",lz833u,"So the simplified way of looking at things is as follows;

Labour side - All wages go up over time. The wealthy at a much greater rate but overall all wages go up. This is done by bargaining (either individually or collectively) and minimum wage has by definition, no bargaining power.

Business side - Labour is an expense for a business, no different than rent, utilities, technology, etc. If all costs go up (either by market or inflation forces), why would minimum wage labour not increase?

Summary - All prices go up and there is no reason minimum wage shouldn't. Minimum wage does not fix the world but it does provide more resources to those who haven't had a pay raises in forever.",gq00i3b
Media that demonstrates gay men as feminine is homophobic and should be frowned upon.,"I'm a bisexual man(But prefers men) so I don't know if it applies to me but if it is then I would prefer to be still demonstrated as masculine. I'm not the most masculine man, I won't lie but I'm still proud of my masculinity.

I have seen a lot of gay men that are masculine and even more masculine than the majority of straight men.

We shouldn't only teach people to be okay with being feminine but we should also tell them that it's okay to be gay AND masculine. A lot of gay men get bullied or insulted because people have this idea that all gay men are drag queens or cross-dressing men with makeup. This is wrong. And the biggest reason why this happens is media.

Gay men are not drag queens nor they are supposed to look like women. They can still like other men and still be masculine and proud of their masculinity but if not, then it's perfectly fine to be feminine too. I see this as a homophobic act because it generalizes gays and generalization/stereotypes are not healthy nor good.

This applies to lesbians too. You can be a lesbian AND be feminine and proud of it too.

Sexuality doesn't affect how you dress or look or behave or move, sexuality is sexuality.

I see a lot of comics, shows and other types of media that do this, people get happy because they see it as a portrayal of homosexuality but I see it wrong no matter the good intentions behind it. I don't read too much comics but I read Iceman(2018) and I love it because it's very accurate and it's just about a masculine gay man with his masculine boyfriend, that's it. When he got out of his closet, he didn't magically grow a dress or a feminine way of talking out of his body. He just kept being himself and this what needs to happen.

TL;DR: Portrayal of gay men being always feminine is wrong and homophobic and insulting and has to change.

EDIT: I think a lot of people misunderstanding the point. I didn't say that any display of gay men being feminine is wrong or homophobic. I meant that it's wrong and homophobic when you display ALL gay men as feminine or drag queens and when you make it their defining point. Generalizations are wrong and we should display all types. Gay men are humans, and it's not healthy to portray any human as 1 trait in the same way it's misogynist or racist to display women/black men as 1 stereotype(Doesn't matter if it's negative or positive)",ixrt3y,"&gt;Media that demonstrates gay men as feminine is homophobic and should be frowned upon. 

Presumably, it's ok for some media to have gay characters who are feminine without being homophobic? Some gay men are feminine.",g68eayp

Fat people who say that they are perfectly fine with their appearance are lying,"More and more we see movements about body acceptance, body positivity campaigns, viral hashtags and videos, etc. While it's hard to argue that reducing bullying and overall misery related to being fat isn't good, I do believe that those people who say that they fully accept how they look and that there is nothing wrong with being fat are lying, both to themselves and to others.

I present you with a scenario. You are fat, in any range of this word's meaning you want, from skinny fat to extremely obese. You are given a pill that instantly turns you into a really good looking and fit person, let's say for men it gives you [Cristiano Ronaldo's body](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5d/93/a9/5d93a9287ca97e4106b0411bd269ffe4.jpg) and for women this [Miss Universe Bikini candidate's body](https://angelopedia.com/newspic/YF0PJRFAKCVene25.jpg). If due to your personal taste you don't consider them very good looking for some reason, then change them into whoever you consider very good/perfect looking.

For the sake of argument, the pill has 0 drawbacks. It's free, it's instant, has no side effects, anything you can think of, it's just perfect.

Now you have a choice. Do you take this pill or not? 

If you say yes, then you are not perfectly fine with how you look. You are just lazy, unmotivated, not willing to put in the work, etc.

If you say no, then let's be real, you are lying to yourself again. I can't think of a reason why someone possibly wouldn't want to take that chance. I can understand if someone doesn't care enough about your own body to focus on improving it, but in this case, you are getting it for completely for free and 0 effort, it's a pure gain.

If you're working with that definition, then you'd have to say that no one who is not living in their absolute ideal life in all facets can honestly say they're happy.

A corporate/professional dress code has no practical function other than distinguishing those who wear it from the unemployed or labouring class.,"I understand why a labourer wears high visibility clothes when they're working at night, why they wear steel capped boots and a helmet. I don't understand why a man with an office job can't wear a singlet. ""Because it's unprofessional"". What is inherently unprofessional about it (beyond its association with the working class)? Men can also rarely wear shorts, even when made out of the same material as suit pants. I understand why flip flops shouldn't be worn in an office (OHS) and yet heels are allowed?

* Most simply, in external-facing roles you want people to look professional. The guy wearing a suit that says ""I am professional"" will be better at selling the same service to another company than the guy showing up in a company T-shirt and shorts, even if they're exactly as successful. You could still argue this is upholding classism, but that isn't *the reason* it's being done; the reason it's being done is because people respect other people dressed well.
* In a more complicated sense, dress codes exist because dress codes exist. Tons of things we do, say, and wear communicate things about our beliefs and lifestyle, even if they only do so circularly. There is nothing inherent about dress codes that makes you a better employee for wearing those clothes, but the fact you're willing to uphold them will signal, to some people, that you're willing to put in the work to be professional and that it will translate to other aspects of employment. Even if you don't think this is true, it is still a reason somebody who *does* think it is true would use to enforce a dress code.",g7e8xni
Opinion pieces without facts should no longer be treated as news.,"""Democrats are idiots"" and ""republicans are Nazis"" serve no real purpose other than profiting the greedy creator by luring in extremists who want biased sources to reinforce their viewpoint.

Phone manufacturers should be required to include basic features/functions.,"On September 7^th , 2016 Apple announced that it would not be including a 3.5mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. This was disappointing for many, but Apple included a 3.5 mm to Lightning adapter in the box, along with a pair of ear buds that connected via Lightning. This solution was sufficient for most people.

However, with the release of the iPhone X, they stopped including that 3.5 mm to Lightning adapter. They only included the Lightning ear buds.

With the release of Google's Pixel 4, they didn't include audio equipment in the box, and charge $30 for a pair of USB-C earbuds (which only work with the Pixel). I fear that Apple is headed in the same direction.

Both companies as well as Samsung launched expensive wireless earbuds around the time that they cut the headphone jack, making it quite obvious that this was motivated by profit. But what about the consumer? This pretty much screws the consumer over. They can spend $30 for a pair of earbuds, then if you break/loose them can you go to Walmart and get a pair of earbuds for $3? No, because they won't work because conveniently your phone has no headphone jack.

"The ""subverted expectations"" meme creates more boring popular media","The debate about *The Last Jedi* done to death at this point. Clearly the film has a lot of defenders and people who loved it. It also has many people who dislike it. I don't think anyone is going to change each other's mind about that film at this point.

One of the major criticisms of that film who didn't like it is that it had unexpected plot points to surprise viewers to ""subvert expectations"". The term ""subverted expectations"" has taken on a life outside of the Last Jedi, and now is being liberally applied on pockets of the internet to any popular media that has an unexpected, shocking plot development that is disliked by the viewer in question using the phrase.

I want to be fair to people using this term and try to avoid a straw-man argument. On the one hand, my first level of discomfort with the term is that much of the beauty of storytelling comes from suspense, surprise, shock, even discomfort. To be led on a tale by a storyteller who makes choice that you might anticipate, so you remain actively engaged and excited. Would a film where everything played out as expected be interesting? 

I get the sense that too much of the analysis of adaptation is being applied to sequels. While changes in adaptations are sometimes warranted and I don't think mere ""faithfulness"" is necessarily a good metric for assessing the quality of an adaptation, I certainly do understand that it's reasonable to compare an adaptation to the original work and see how it ""lives up to it"".

But sequels aren't adaptations. They're continuations. 

Spoilers for the video game *The Last of Us 2* leaked today. I won't be revealing them in detail here, as you can read them elsewhere. However, for the purposes of this post, it might be helpful to know that one of the major surprises is (non-specific but major detail)&gt;!you play as a different main character to the advertised main character for much of  the game.!&lt;

The game is already being compared to *The Last Jedi* for ""subverting expectations"", in a negative way. It's also being compared to *Game of Thrones* Season 8. 

While I was disappointed by a lot of *Game of Thrones* s8, I do think some of the backlash is highly exaggerated. The vitriolic hate campaign against D&amp;D and desire to portray them as complete talentless scumbags is completely overblown. I largely agree that the show was at its best when it was adapting the novels and overall dropped in quality once they were ahead of the books, however there was good writing on the show before and after that point (one of the best pieces of writing on the show is a scene between Robert Baratheon and Cersei which didn't exist in the books). The writers have done good work outside of *Game of Thrones* as well (*The 25th Hour*, for example). Acting like it takes no skill to adapt something is... absurd, since we know how much adaptations can vary in quality.

One thing I did like about *Game of Thrones* season 8 was the &gt;!turning of Daenerys. !&lt;To me, this had been set up for several seasons with her wanton use of violence, hard stance and reliance on dragons for her rule. She had never been a moderate leader, and that story was her logical endpoint. But no, this was *subverted expectations.*

If you've skimmed to this point, that's OK, but **the real kicker is here;**

**Was it ""subverted expectations"" when;**  
\- In the *Empire Strikes Back*, it was revealed Darth Vader is Luke's father, despite this contradicting and probably not even having been planned at the time of the original movie?

\- In *Game of Thrones* Season 1 (and the original book) when &gt;!Ned Stark dies!&lt;?

\- In *The Last of Us* original game, when &gt;!you find out Ellie needs to die to get the vaccine, and you kill people to save her and lie about it to Ellie?!&lt;

Some of you are saying, ""No, you're missing the point with these comparisons. The point of the ""subverted expectations"" complaint is when the writing is lazy and something unexpected happens just for shock value."" This is what I mean about wanting to avoid the straw-man argument, because I don't want to say anyone using this term is merely saying ""surprise is bad!""

However, even if you dislike GOT S8, The Last Jedi, and TLOU 2 (although I ultimately feel we should all wait to actually experience it as a game to truly judge it positively or negatively), it's disingenuous to say that these plot developments happen ""only"" for shock value. There are thematic and narrative reasons for the twist in each case. Shock value plays a part, but so does it in each of the examples above.

Instead, it seems like once popular media reaches a certain a zenith of understanding of what it ""is"" in the internet age, caring about what made it exciting and surprising in the first place goes out the window, and instead, viewers want the logic of adaptation applied where media is just regurgigated back ad nauseam with no new ideas - which is how we end of with media like *The Mandalorian* which is about nothing other than itself - headed by nostalgia for Boba Fett and marketed with Baby Yoda to sell toys forever.

Ok, Ok, I probably just lost some of you with the hate on *The Mandalorian*. If there are moments in it that excite you and surprise you, that's great. But does it take any *risks?* Do we want popular media that is completely afraid of ever surprising the audience?",g8ysfo,"The subverted expectations meme was created as a response to the idea that subverting expectations is in and of itself a mark of good writing. To use Game of Thrones as an example, the earlier seasons subverted expectations constantly and did it well.

The goal of transphobes is to get trans people assaulted and force them back in the closet.,"(I will not be talking about sport in this section. From what I have read the science is not conclusive yet and discussions center around opinions over facts)

One talking point that TERFs (Trabs Exclusionary Radical Feminists) bring up quiet often is they do not want trans women given access to women's changing rooms, crises centers and prisons. The argument they give is that doing so bring an increased risk to cis women as cis men may use this as a way of assulting women.

Firstly assault is still illegal and transwomen using restrooms is not a loophole to get away with it.

Secondly where do TERFs think all the trans people will go?

Trana men would be forced into women's only locations which definitely negates the whole point of these bills.

Trans womens would be forced into women's only locations where TERFs belive assault would be more likely. 

We can already see that in the UK trans women are at a massive risk in men's prisons where they are at an increased risk of assault while the risk the other way is much lower.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/uk-52748117

It seems unlikely that TERFs would not have stumbled upon this information as they scour the Internet for anything to abuse trans people with.

So in conclusion I belive TERFs know that trans inclusion in women's spaces provides little to no inherent risk to cis women and their goal by excluding them is to put them in danger.",ll25g1,"Definitely *some* transphobes want trans people to *stop existing*. But I don’t think that’s the thought behind *all*, or even *most* transphobe’s actions and beliefs.

I think they often either don’t understand, they feel their rights are somehow being encroached upon. Most transphobes I’ve met are *fine with trans people existing* as long as they *don’t have to acknowledge trans people’s genders*. 

Why do they feel that way? I mean, I think a lot of people (especially on Reddit) don’t have much experience interacting with trans people. Maybe their only exposure is like, tumblrinaction posts that mock nonbinary teenagers trying to explore their gender identity. 

TERFs are particularly dangerous transphobes - in the case of TERFs I think the goal *is* to force trans people back into the closet. But transphobia is more commonly just “I don’t understand, you’re making me uncomfortable, you’re being weird, you do you but don’t make me change.” I don’t think *that* type of transphobe *has any express goal in mind*. 

And then there’s people as well who are *fine* with trans people, but for some reason *get upset when you label things as transphobic*. These are the “we must tolerate the intolerant” types. You see them a lot on Reddit, but it’s interesting because it seems to be mostly limited to Reddit. You’ll often see them saying “I will defend your right to disagree with me,” or something along those lines. I think this thought process comes from being sheltered, and not experiencing discrimination, therefore not understanding *why discrimination is an issue*. 

TERFs are pretty blatant in their transphobia, because unlike these other types of transphobes, they view *trans people as a threat to their safety*. Which is why you’ll often see them talking about transwomen in women prisons, or transwomen in women’s shelters. They are the *classic* kind of transphobic.",gnna816
Twitter is overall detrimental to human society.,"I work at one of the non-Meta FANNG companies (I guess MANG companies, now, sorry Netflix), so I absolutely think that premise of The Social Dilemma ([linked summary/review](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/21/netflix-movie-the-social-dilemma-slams-social-media-review.html)) is correct. **In short, social media companies use algorithms based on psychology to show you the most engaging content possible in order to keep you on the site as long as possible.** From the social media companies' perspective, their goal is to keep you on the platform to expose your eyes to as many ads as possible. **However, ""engaging content"" is content that triggers some kind of strong emotional response, and the stronger your emotions are, the longer you'll engage with the platform's content.**

Meta, rightfully so, gets a lot of heat for this because they own the platforms that control a staggering amount of human communication -- Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and their now-unified Messenger. **But I think Twitter, while significantly smaller in users, has an outsized negative impact on society.**

Twitter's 280 character limit forces users to make extremely concise points. That is terrible for trying to explain complex ideas, which normally take way, way more than that. **You just can't sum up entire concepts like ""Marxism"" or ""critical race theory"" or ""do masks work?"" in 280 characters.** And yet, that is what a lot of people use Twitter for. Twitter, I think, also suffers from only really having a ""like"" option, where there's no way to counter pile-ons, and drives very one-sided content with no counterweight.

**Sharing very abbreviated thoughts about complicated concepts on a platform that is designed to make you angry or horny does not result in high-quality conversation.** Twitter users are, in my opinion, a lot like reactive dogs, and have no clue how to respond to a stimuli they don't agree with beyond screaming. The platform is coded to sustain that kind of reaction, and when you have a bunch of people screaming about public health and racism on it, you just end up with the worst perspectives on both sides of the spectrum. 

Twitter has fewer than 400 million worldwide users, which is relatively small for a social media platform, but its influence extends beyond that reach because pretty much every ""elite"" has an account. **In the U.S., the elites that concern me the most are journalists, because journalists absolutely** ***live*** **on Twitter (although I won't let other ""thought leaders"" or whatever off the hook).** First, journalists are competing for viral content and followers on Twitter in the newsroom, which a lot of editors encourage (I have friends in journalism who are open about it). Journalists, IMO, are supposed to be focusing on reporting accurate news, and explaining important things going on in the world. Setting aside any and all objectivity concerns, even nonpartisan news doesn't benefit from being written with the goal of going viral.

The other problem with ""elites"" constantly being on Twitter is that they exist in the echo chamber, too. Good journalists are supposed to spend time talking to people, and just wandering around observing things to try to gather information. **But now that journalists are spending all of their time on Twitter, their ""observations"" can be extremely influenced by the pack of reactive dogs on there.** The ""man at the diner"" has been replaced with ""man who went viral,"" even though there are way, way more humans like the man at the diner in the world. At its most exhausting, you have entire news cycles about drama that only happens on Twitter and has no impact elsewhere -- like the inane Taylor Lorenz vs. Dave Weigel ""scandal"" -- in major publications. But much more subtly, any journalist who isn't really careful is going to have their worldview shaped by only hearing the most extreme ends of either spectrum on a daily basis. So even if you're not on Twitter, you can still get sucked into the reactivity because it's influencing so much of the conversation around you.

I spent way, way too much of 2020 and early 2021 on Twitter. I rage-quit the app after I spent over 30 minutes in a circular argument with a stranger about classism and food in the Ohio River Valley, and suddenly realized what an insane waste of my time, and, more importantly, emotional energy that was. I've always prided myself on being a pragmatic and open-minded person, and quitting Twitter also made me realize how much more reactive and closed-minded I was becoming. **Spending too much time on Twitter ultimately just makes you overly emotional and intense. Constant communication based around emotionally-driven, hyper-succinct opinions is just not healthy for human beings.**

Change my view. What value does Twitter bring to society?",vzb7ba,"Twitter definitely *tries* to be bad. I use Twitter with no problems myself, but the algorithm obviously doesn't care what I think or want, it keeps suggesting things which data suggests I have zero interests in. It keeps prioritizing the tweets that I see so that I miss what some of my friends are writing, too. For this reason I do think that Twitter is a bit bad, it actually tries to steer things in a bad direction, it's not just the users.

But it's still managable. Just stay away from politics and it's a fine platform. Use it for talking with friends, and not for discussing whatever everyone is currently angry about, and try to stay out of drama. Then you'll be alright.",ig8yjy4

What am I missing?",m3taou,"When something has problems, it's problematic.

Contracts need more regulation,"Okay I know the title is a bit vague but there are a few things that are equally important to me. One is, just because someone is over 18, doesn't mean they should be able to sign their rights away. This isn't to say they shouldn't be able to sign their rights away, but that being over 18 and not having a major disability doesn't mean you are qualified to make such a decision. Second, just because someone thinks they understand a contract, doesn't mean they do. Contracts should have to be written out in a simple and easy to understand way for the person signing, but are often confusing and use linguistic tricks that get past the person signing. And the issue that I have most experience with, is those who made the contract telling the signer to ""sign here"" without mentioning or bringing up what they are actually signing. This is most common with employers in my experience, the employer will tell me to sign something and I'll get weird looks when I carefully read through before signing. The reason I thought to make this post was at my job orientation yesterday, the union came in and had us sign a contract to join. The union members told my group of, being honest, not very intelligent or well spoken people, to just sign in three different spaces. I read it, meanwhile my coworkers blindly signed and saw that I would be giving the union full access to my paycheck, including the ability to take money out of my paycheck. No limit, no indication of amount. I refused to sign as my coworkers unknowingly gave the right for the union to take their entire paycheck. Now, I dont think the union would take anything without disclosing it and they wouldn't take much. However, what I'm arguing is that everybody who signed should have known that the union is given the power to take their paycheck. In conclusion, it should have to be proven that someone signing a contract understands it, not that they signed their name when asked.

TL;DR
Most people can't interpret contracts and shouldn't be liable after signing when they were mislead and did not understand it.",lbh5js,"There's actually *a lot* of ground to dispute a contractual agreement in a court of law, although I'm sure the extent varies between jurisdictions.

r/watchpeopledie should be reinstated.,"Edit: View changed, see delta comments.

The title sums up my point simply. I think r/watchpeopledie should return.

My view is held for two main reasons:

1. It was a reminder to people that things which are deceptively simple or commonplace can still be lethal - e.g. driving, lifting extremely heavy objects, misusing firearms, et cetera. This is speculative and I am using wishful thinking that \*some\* quantity of people will adjust their behavior to avoid unnecessary risk.(You can summarize this as being an Order theorist in sociology. I am viewing the removal of the sub from this perspective (sociology) and am most receptive to arguments from this perspective, though of course am open to other avenues.)
2. As I understand it, the sub-Reddit community was removed because it violated legal boundaries on notification to the next of kin, or something to that effect. My concern is that this pales in comparison to the utility of the reminder from point #1 - people need a reminder of how easily they can die, particularly in ""1st/2nd world"" countries where a high quality of life in relative comfort can be taken for granted.The legal and ethical issues of not notifying the next of kin first are secondary to this caution. Ideally, posts would, of course, first confirm that family/friends/coworkers have been notified of the person(s) death(s), but this is not always tenable and can be omitted in the grand scheme of things (again, looking at this from a sociology perspective primarily).

\---

To change/challenge my view you need to:

* Convincingly argue that the ethical, legal, and/or moral concerns are greater than the utility gained from the reinstatement of r/watchpeopledie (or the introduction of an equivalent, *without censorship*).
* Reasonably argue that the order theory (from a sociological perspective) is bunk/trivial/otherwise untenable.
* Address some other point(s) I may have overlooked or left unaddressed.

the government should provide free food for anyone who asks,"basically the title. The Roman empire used to provide free bread for the citizens of Rome: not starving was an inviolable right of Roman citizenship. It seems unbelievable to me that modern states cant afford their citizens a similar dignity. 

Specifically, I think that the food the governments freely offers should be calculated to provide enough calories  and generally consist of things like low quality bread, vegetables and protein snacks, to be collected at specially designated centres. Besides being in accord with the generally agreed on moral fact that human beings have the natural right not to starve to death in civilised human society, I think this would have the additional benefit of eliminating public begging almost over night as anyone who was begging for food would clearly just be intending to use the money for drugs. Hence those dependent on drugs would have the majority of their enabling income cut off. 

I made a very rough calculation for the cost of this endeavour: imagine we take the price of cheap bread as approximate to our bland daily meal. In my home country of the UK, around 12 million people are held to live in poverty. Let's say generously say that all of them choose to rely entirely on government distributed cheap bread to live. Again, in the UK an 800g loaf of bread, providing 2100 calories, costs around 1 pound. That's 12 million pounds a day or around 4 billion a year. Thats a sixth of my country's military budget. Now I'm aware that you can't live on bread alone but the point stands that providing the necessary calories to every impoverished man woman and child in the UK wouldn't be that exorbitant.

Killing baby Lenin would've saved more lives than killing baby Hitler.,"I recently read the Gulag Archipelago, and holy shit—I can't believe humanity is capable of such atrocities. It wasn't even so much the unparalleled, often arbitrary mass killings/purgings of 'Anti-Soviet Agitators' so much as it was the unspeakable horrors endured by those unlucky enough to survive. Tortures beyond your wildest imagination; the utter physical and psychological destruction of millions upon millions of people. Living in the constant fear that you, or anybody you've ever met, may say/have said something that could be construed as being anti-communist, thus ensuring yourself a 'tenner' (ten year sentence) (if you're lucky). The fact that an 'organ' might just decide to pick you up for literally no reason, and then proceed break you to the point of confessing to crimes you've never even conceived and incriminating/denouncing all those whom you love.

I'm not saying this to downplay Hitler's abhorrence; his regime remains one of history's most evil. But Hitler's government lasted a decade; Lenin's lasted seven—and its effects still linger in many countries to this day (\*cough\* China \*cough\*). 20th century communism has been far and away the deadliest, cruellest ideology ever to plague humanity. The amount of sheer suffering caused by communist governments over the past century is simply unparalleled.

So, if you were to stick me in a time machine and tell me I could assassinate one historical leader, I'm not going for Hitler—I'm going for Lenin. Change my mind.

EDIT: One caveat outstanding: it's hard to pick between Lenin and Marx. Marx himself probably wouldn't be deserving of it, but it *was* his theories which sparked the hell that is 20th century communism. Hard to say which of them would have a greater impact. But both still beat Hitler by a mile, IMO.",svm8lh,"You cannot possibly know that.

Working for a big tech company is lowkey a bit traitorous to society,"Unless you've been living under a rock the past decade, it's been made pretty clear at this point that social media has had some massively negative affect on society as a whole. Yes, obviously there have been some great things to have come out it (like reddit haha) but I'm a bit shocked at all the negative affects that sort of just get brushed over all the time. Can't even begin on how easily social media is able to manipulate society behavior: election manipulation, violence (for ex: myanmar [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/technology/myanmar-facebook.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/technology/myanmar-facebook.html)), pushing individuals to buy items through their advertisements, and a pretty astounding amount of privacy violation to name a few.

The worst part of it all is that these companies profit off this all, and as far as I've seen they don't seem to care too much about the damage they cause. I'm sorry, but if you consciously seek to work for places like these, you're only helping them push their agendas and engineering their morally questionable practices to be even more efficient - just because they'll throw you a bunch of money + benefits at you. There's no way anyone looking to work at these places doesn't know about these practices, so they're literally saying they're ok with it all as long as they get a big pay check at the end of the year.

And before you say ""if you don't like it, just get off social media"" that doesn't take away from my point - this is about the people running/designing these systems, not the users on it (if anything, they're victims).",jz19go,I think that this is generally true when working for a large company (in a highly skilled field).

"The GOP, in the past decade, has stopped fighting for actual policy change and instead has turned into very little more than an opposition party.","Let's start this by a disclaimer: I'm a liberal-leaning independent who really hates both parties. But, I've noticed that the republican party has changed since Obama to a party that just bases any new policy or belief on solely opposing the democrat party. The main reasons I have for this belief are that the only solid policy for the GOP comes out of the 20th century or before, the party is riddled with conspiracy theories that attack and slander democrats, trump has abandoned many conservative policies and has received little to no criticism for it and that their only modern policy seems to be saying that they won't do what democrats do instead of proposing a different avenue.

So first off, the only policy that Republicans actually have comes out of the 20th century: lower taxes, pro-life don't take away our guns, personal liberty, states' rights. But the world is changing, and every new issue that voters care about is simply denied by Republicans rather than the party suggesting alternative policy. Take climate change for example: instead of proposing alternative policy, the status quo in Republicans is to claim that it doesn't even exist in the first place. Racial inequality as well - instead of proposing policy, they spend all their time nitpicking that the country isn't ""systemically"" racist and calling BLM members communists so they don't actually have to face the problem. Similar things have happened with healthcare costs and drug reform. Some Republicans have proposed policy for these things, but they're known as mavericks who have broken from their party (John Kasich, John McCain, Mitt Romney).

Second, the right is riddled with conspiracies specifically accusing democrats wildly of random stuff. Like, it's not enough that they want to raise taxes, but they also need to be an elite gang of pedophiles who run child sex rings in the basements of pizza shops or put microchips made by deep state operatives like Gates and Soros in items that help save lives to control our minds. And these are barely even fringe conspiracies anymore. A very decent percentage of Republicans believe some or part of both of these. This means to me that they just want to demonize Democrats and fear monger more than propose policy.

Speaking of conspiracy theorists, Trump has shown that the GOP is ready and willing to abandon classic policy like limiting the power of the presidency, being respectful and ""presidential"", being a man of family and faith, and lowering the deficit. Not only that, but he has some of the strongest and most fervent support among Republicans I've seen in a while. I can only assume that his intense support among Republicans is extremely tied to the corresponding detest by the democrat policy.

Lastly, a lot of republican ""policy"" has turned into ONLY attacking democrat policy and calling it socialist or communist, then offering no alternative solution to problems that are still very much real. For example, everyone can agree that healthcare costs are far too high. But the only thing close to a solution by Republicans is uniting behind what they WONT do, not what they will do. And those things they won't do are in direct opposition to democratic policies. This also connects to climate change, student debt (to a lesser degree), racism, education reform, police reform, and prison reform (to a lesser degree).",jzbh73,"&gt;The GOP, in the past decade, has stopped fighting for actual policy change and instead has turned into very little more than an opposition party.

I mean, Widerstand gegen den Nationalsozialismus was an oppositional party too.

So normally this is the point where I just start citing a bunch of Republican bills passed in areas the media and you don't care about, but as this is the 50th post in this sub failing to make the same point again, I'd rather point out that black sub that racially bans posts based on skin color have enjoyed the Republican's idea of a stimulus bill so well. They are now under the belief the Trump's government has abandoned them and good ole uncle Joe will bring back stimulus checks for everyone. The fact is, the Republicans are so good for you the Democrats constantly steal credit for their actions.

This is in response to another post, as I found that this was really the biggest issue with my view.  For those coming from that pose, hopefully this gives better context.

I have some close gay friends, so this is a concern for me as someone who has strong religious beliefs. I'm worried that if they were to ask me about my views and I told them, they would no longer want to be friends.  I think we should be able to be friends, but I get that it’s quite tricky since I’m basically admitting to thinking a major part of their lifestyle is wrong.

Christians (the real ones) don't hate people because they are trans or gay.  But I think the problem people have with Christians' view on this is that it is in a sense (or maybe completely) denying a trans person's chosen identity. I'm curious if it's possible for a Christian to hold the view that transgenderism is a sin without it upsetting or being problematic for trans people.

My main thought process through this is: what if my LGBTQ friend asked me what my view on it all was? What would my honest response be? And is there a way that we could still be friends afterward? This is my concern going in. I'm not trying to get rid of my LGBTQ friends, but I'm also not willing to lie about what I believe.

As a Christian, I don’t have a problem with being close friends with people within the LGBTQ community.  I don’t want to or plan to go around telling random people on the street my religious beliefs on the matter.  I think that’s unproductive and harmful because it’s not ever going to be seen as coming from a place of love or respect for them as a person.  Is that also going to have to be the case with my gay friends?

I know this is controversial, so I’m thanking those in advance who choose to try to understand my view and discuss it with me.

Thanks,

All media outlets should be forced to change to not for profit organisations.,"I truly believe the primary function of media outlets should be the spread of information.

The USSR should have won the space race.,"Before we start, I want to state that I'm not a communist or USSR-worshipper by any means, and I can't think of very many topics that I would take their side on.

But the fact that the U.S. is considered the winner of the space race and not the Soviet Union is utter BS.

First off the USSR was worlds ahead of the U.S. from the start with getting Sputnik I into orbit before America was finished launching its first rocket without it blowing up in mid-air.

And from there the Soviets cranked out milestone after milestone like the first animal in space, the first human in space, the first space station etc.

What was America's shining achievement that ""won"" us the space race?

First man on the moon....

Don't get me wrong that's an amazing feat but it pales in comparison to the many, equally groundbreaking achievements of the USSR. 

Anyway, I think I've made my point.

Sure they put things into space and orbit, but the United States essentially did the same thing but even more complex and risky.

The united states demonstrated the highest technical application of the technology at the time sooner than the soviets.  The moon was the furthest either side could have gotten at the time, meaning the highest technical requirement.",fn1h2qi
It is unfair to stereotype teenagers as liking to do stupid things,"As a teenager myself, I get offended when people create stereotypes about teenagers being immature, reckless, hormonal, emotional, stupid, or whatever ridiculous word. Most teens aren't stupid. I never knew any friend or classmate at school who did anything particularly stupid. I never seen anyone going around climbing rooftops or driving while drunk. Teenagers do have brains and can understand how they will be embarrassed if they do something stupid. That is why most teens don't do anything stupid.",d1yof8,"They're intelligent, but they don't have the experience or the discipline built into them to realize their limits. 

Enough cock-ups and other scares will sculpt all of you into the kind of people you want to be, some sooner than others. You're human, and I love you anyway.",ezr9s9d
There is no clear “next step” after acknowledging the existence of white privilege and most people who argue for it simply want to hear that their life is harder than white people’s.,"
I’m white and I’m 100% on board with acknowledging the existence of white privilege. It took a little while for me to get there, but over the course of my life, I have come to realize that, even though my life isn’t completely where I want it to be, I’ve been given a significant head start because I’m white and my parents are white and their parents were white, etc. So even if I don’t directly benefit in 2021 like my grandparents did in the 50’s, that wave is still rolling. 

But it seems to me that the entire argument is centered around making white people accept that they’re privileged. I have never once heard a POC explain what I’m supposed to DO with that knowledge.  I’ve argued countless times with people online desperate to simply hear my say that their life is harder than theirs. Once I acknowledge it, the conversation always fizzles and dissipates into nothing, almost as if hearing that was the entire goal. That sucks because I’ve “given up” so to speak, they win the argument, and yet they still will struggle with whatever life throws at them while I don’t. 


What exactly do you want me to do? If I’m competing with a black person for a job that I really need, should I give it up for fear that I’ll be playing into a systemic problem that I didn’t create? When being stopped by police, should I question them on whether they treat black people as well as they treat me? Should I give up my loan because a black person may have a harder time getting one approved? 

Without being in a position of authority, there is no clear “next step” after I accept that I’m privileged for being white. I have never once been given instruction on how to get rid of this privilege. This makes me care much less about the issue and pretty much puts me in a place where I’m content to just enjoy it.",n36ac4,I would argue that there is nothing you can do about it and that's ok. White privilege is a few percentage advantage spread over several million people. It's not that big of deal in the grand scheme of things and one person won't be able to push the needle anyways. Just keep being a good person and don't worry about it,gwqf4ys
The Great Gatsby is not a good book at all.,"I know that book preferences is a very subjective topic, but I still want to hear reasons for why some readers like The Great Gatsby. 

I’ve read the book twice, once while in HS and once in college when I was about 21 (I’m 23 now). I can’t for the love of me figure out why it is considered a classic or a good book at all. The characters are all boring and unlikeable (I understand that for some of the characters this is probably intentional), I can’t even really describe the plot to you, the symbolism of wealth and greed and the “American Dream” just falls flat to me. 

Now, the thing is, I DO usually enjoy classic books. My favorite book of all time is Les Miserables. I can even admire other classic books I don’t like that are heavy with symbolism too, like the Scarlet Letter. That was very difficult for me to finish but I understand the appeal and why the messages in the story matter. But The Great Gatsby? I just don’t get it. I’m open to learning why others do like it.",u30iw0,"It’s all about the story telling.  The plot isn’t really that intricate but the way that everything develops into an unavoidable tragedy is incredible.   It also makes a great statement about people.   Some people destroy lives and move on as if nothing ever happened, Tom and Daisy are the epitome of that idea.  The characterization is top notch.   Tom and Daisy get two people killed and then Nick spies them through their kitchen window commiserating over a plate of cold chicken.   Any book that makes you notice a bunch of new stuff every time you read it is a diamond in the rough.",i4nz2lt
If gender identities did not exist neither would transgenderism,"I feel like transgenderism is a symptom of the problem and not the solution, it's peoples response to gender identities existing. If people weren't put in boxes that defined how they look, sound and behave then people wouldn't want to change boxes. I do find it silly how people are teaching this, telling their impressionable kids they can be the gender that the best identify with instead of teaching them not to live in a box that defines who they are.

I also get referred to studies about babies brain scans proving that people are born trans which I do not believe to be true however I do not really understand what I'm reading in regards to academic and scientific studies so any dumbed down explanations on these studies would be appreciated.

Do people really identify themselves based on what's between their legs?

I myself have struggled with the idea of being trans and the depression that seems to inevitably come with it but ultimately it was the notion that other people do not define who I am that got me through it.

I want everyone to be happy and my views on this does not mean I am against people being trans, I just believe it's inherently tied to a concept that shouldn't exist.",jvt4np,"&gt;Do people really identify themselves based on what's between their legs?

Well, some people don't want to.

It's also easy for us, who never had any complicated feelings about this, to wonder why this is part of your identity anyway. I don't like gender roles either. I had this period of finding non-binary interesting and then getting angry at that movement because it wasn't what I expected and I didn't understand either, then having some good talks and thoughts about it to realise I was being an asshhole who got angry at things he didn't understand... and also that I, ultimately, identify as a man.

I think I principally agree with it being better if those boxes weren't there, but they are there, and there's not much of a choice to adapt.",gclzuoe
Changing the race or sex of a comic book character for the sake of diversity is stupid,"I often see this notion online where when an actor's time is up in a show, movie, or series of movies that the character in question's race or gender should be changed. For example, upon watching the recently released Batman trailer with Robert Pattinson playing Batman, I saw a large group of people in the comments and on twitter suggesting that if the Joker is to be added, he should be played by Lakeith Stanfield (a black actor). Upon reading these people's ideas, I thought to myself what the point of changing a character's race is simply for the sake of diversity when it doesn't align with the portrayal of the character at hand.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm all for having characters on TV or in cinema be any race or gender, so long as the actor playing said character fits the history of the character (e.g. Black panther, Captain marvel, Lucius Fox, etc.). Another example of this issue is the conversation of having an actor such as Idris Elba play James Bond when the character has always been white throughout the 007 movies. Regardless of the race or sex of a character, I feel it's appropriate to match the actor with said race or sex.

EDIT: it’s been a while since I created this post and it kinda blew up so don’t think I’m intentionally avoiding a specific topic or thought process, it’s just hard to keep track of replying to this many comments.

EDIT2: gonna take a bit of a break from responding. It’s getting kinda hard to keep track of so many comments and responses but I thank you for giving them nonetheless. Also to the few outliers ruining it by calling me a racist and a sexist, fuck off",ioen5z,"I’ve been reading some of the exchanges on here, and what I’m getting is that OP thinks that even for characters where their race/gender isn’t integral to the plot or their overall character, changing it is unnecessary and OP thinks it’s better to keep these consistent with the way the original authors intended. 

With this mindset, what is reasonable to change, and what isn’t? If the first James Bond had black eyes, does that mean we can’t have a James Bond with blue eyes? 

If changing a character’s race/gender feels like it would change their history and personality, I don’t think it’s a problem, since it seems okay to change some aspects of a character’s personality and history if it has nothing to do with their race/gender anyway. 

I think writers like changing parts of a character to make them new and interesting, and switching the race/gander feels like a great way to get a fresh take on it. 

I feel that OP is mostly annoyed at franchises that do this solely for the sake of pandering, instead of actually trying to create a well written character. Which would be fair to be honest, though I can see there being a bit of a blurry line between the two depending on how you look at it.",g4fci8e
