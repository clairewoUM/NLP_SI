People who bought and continue to buy cocaine are significantly responsible and blameworthy for the bad conditions of migrants at the southern US border.,"I posted something like this as more of a rant in the unpopular opinion sub, and boy was it unpopular.

Though it was fun to rant and get outraged there, I want to have a more productive exchange about this, so I'm straightening out the argument and want to hear what people have to say. So here goes:

The situation at the US southern border is a humanitarian crisis. Without going into the political sides on that issue, what got me thinking about it was an article posted on /politics about the camps being de-facto concentration camps. And both people on the left and the right agree that whatever is going on is *bad*.

So I want to think about two things: The *causes* of the problem, and the *responsibility* for the problem. And right off the bad, I will completely grant that US laws and policies are a big causal contribution, and that whoever is *responsible* for the laws and policies (government officials, government leaders, the president, legislators, the voters that voted for them, the PACs and donors that helped get them elected etc.) is properly blamed and responsible for the results. I do **not** want to discuss how to **divvy up the blame among anyone in that group**. I also have no problem agreeing that the war on drug and US foreign policy bears significant blame for situation. (For an partisan-ish take on this I'll grant for the sake of the argument, see this Vice article: [The Violence Central American Migrants Are Fleeing Was Stoked by the US, Vice News, June 28, 2018](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvnyzq/central-america-atrocities-caused-immigration-crisis))

None of this contradicts the other clear fact that drug trafficking is what sustains the situation, and now that the US is no longer funding rebel forces, it is the cash from drug trafficking that keeps the Cartels and gangs in business and in power.

&gt; In  a  number  of  Central  American  countries,  crime  is  the  paramount  public  policy  issue,  deciding  elections  and  changing  the  relationship  between  the  people  and  their  government.^3  The  crime  problem  in  this  region  has  been  well researched, including recent work by UNDP^4 and the World Bank,^5 as well as previous UNODC assessments on Central  America  (2007)^6  and  the  Caribbean  (2007,  with  the World Bank).^7 There is no need to duplicate this work, so the present study will focus on what is widely recognized to be the central threat confronting the region today: 

&gt;* the flow of cocaine, 
* the criminal groups this flow empowers, and 
* the violence associated with both.

&gt;^3 For example, the Commissioner of Human Rights in Honduras has declared drug trafficking and organized crime to be public enemy number one in his country, alongside corruption. http://www.conadeh.hn/index.php/7-conadeh/69-derecho-a-la-salud

Further, I'm limiting this discussion to cocaine both because it is a drug that can be dangerous and lead to addiction [Cocaine, National Institute on Drug Abuse, July 2018](http://centerforchildwelfare.fmhi.usf.edu/kb/subabuse/cocaine18.pdf), because it is not produced legally for non-medical consumption anywhere in the world [Legal status of cocaine, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_status_of_cocaine), and because it is a majorly significant economic factor in the situation.

The most recent data, admittedly by US drug officials, but still, have Guatemala transferring 1,400 metric tons of cocaine last year [International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, US Department of State, Volume I March 2019, p. 170](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/INCSR-Vol-INCSR-Vol.-I-1.pdf#page=176). The most recent UN data puts the market price for cocaine in the US at 93$ per gram in 2016 [Heroin and cocaine prices in Europe and USA, UNODC](https://dataunodc.un.org/drugs/heroin_and_cocaine_prices_in_eu_and_usa). That means in 2018 $130 billion worth of cocaine were shipped through a country which is forecast to have a GDP of $80 billion for the same year [Guatemala GDP Forecast, Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/guatemala/gdp).

If you have illegal products going through your country at 1.5 times the value of your gross domestic product, it is no surprise that you cannot keep law and order and protect the citizens. That means the cocaine trade **alone** is sufficient to make things as bad as they are in Guatemala.

And they are bad. Here is a collection of stories from children growing up in gang violence by Unicef [Growing Up Surrounded by Violence in Central America, Unicef USA, October 17, 2018](https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/growing-surrounded-violence-central-america/34580). For an example:
&gt; ""Where I live, there are gangs. They're the ones who rule here,""  a 15-year-old girl lamented in 2016. While her mother was away, on her fourth attempt to find work in the U.S., the teenager was left to watch over her two younger siblings.  ""They look for children from the community to bring them into the gang,"" she says. ""I have a cousin who converted. He's in the gang now. He's only 12 years old. Now they're looking for him, to kill him. A friend of his was just killed. They stabbed him. Then they cut him into pieces and put him in a bag which they left for my aunt."" © UNICEF/UN028146/Zehbrauskas

At their worst, they carry out mass beheadings:
&gt; Guatemala declared a 30-day state of emergency for the northern Peten region following the brutal massacre of 27 people at a cattle ranch. [...]
A 23-year-old laborer who survived the attack said he was stabbed in the stomach, but his attackers were distracted by an attempt by some of the other victims to flee. The chilling scene was related by the surviving farm worker, who spoke to The Associated Press Monday from his hospital bed in a nearby town. Authorities asked that the survivor not be named for security reasons. [...]
The only other survivor was a pregnant woman whose young daughter clung to her so fiercely and cried so loudly the killers let her go.

Just as any market, cocaine price and revenue is driven by supply and demand. The 2012 UN report pointed out that at that point US demand had been dropping, but due to big drug busts and increased enforcement in Mexico, along with increased stability in Columbia in 2006,
&gt; The sharp decline in cocaine supply created a vicious circle for  drug  traffickers.  Forced  to  cut  purity  and  raise  prices,  they  further  damaged  their  consumer  base  in  the  United States.  Within  two  years,  the  price  of  pure  cocaine  effec-tively doubled, and this surely had an impact on the relative attraction of the drug, particularly for first-time and casual users. [TOCNAC, UN 2012, p 18](https://www.unodc.org/documents/toc/Reports/TOCTASouthAmerica/English/TOCTA_CACaribb_cocaine_orgCrimegroups_violence.pdf) 

Since 2012, a number of indicators point to an increase in consumption. The Brookings Institute provides a helpful graphic with data trends for seven indicators from 2005-2015 [Mixed messages: Is cocaine consumption in the U.S. going up or down?, Brookings Institute, April 18, 2017, Figure I](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/mixed-messages-is-cocaine-consumption-in-the-u-s-going-up-or-down/). The only indicator trending downward is treatment admission, which is lively explained by the policy focus on the opioid crises. Arrestee drug tests and workplace drug tests were slightly up, while two measures of Overdoses, past month users, and new users were all trending up.

A final point. The UN report notes that, as the market for cocaine shrinks, in the immediate aftermath this leads to an *increase* in violence as the remaining gangs fight over a shrinking pie. That's a typical effect of market disruption, but in the long term less $ being pumped through the drug trafficking in relation to GDP will lead to more government security and stability. Especially as the drug traffickers spend their money within the local economies, and without driving inflation by continuing to get more drug money, the drug money could, over time, work to build wealth for non-criminal economic activity. But feel free to CMV on this part. 

Ok, that's the empirical facts. Here are some things I am claiming:

**1\. Buying cocaine directly causally contributes to the gang violence in central America.**

I think that's indisputable, but feel free to CMV. Of course the legality of it is a factor. But no one legalizes cocaine, decriminalizing it wouldn't change anything in the supply chain and only helps treatment and overdose prevention for users, but it doesn't address the economic and social impact on Central America. And, again, what the laws *should be* is besides the point. Everyone knows what they **are**, and you should know that there is no way you're getting any cocaine that hasn't been trafficked by a central American gang. Feel free to bring any philosophical account of causation into this, but in *none* of them is *individuals buying drugs* not a causal contributor to the thriving of the gangs. 

And because of that, I say:

**2\. The kind of causal contribution individual drug purchasers have to the gang economy and resulting violence makes them significantly responsible and blameworthy for the results.**

The argument for this starts from a pretty simple principle: 

**Causal-Moral Principle:** You are responsible and blameworthy for anything you freely and willingly cause, unless you have a relevant excuse.

I think that's pretty evident, at least if we're not complete nihilists about responsibility and blame. I want to bracket that meta-ethical position for this discussion. I want to hear from people that *blame* the people responsible for the drug policy, or *blame* Trump for the conditions in the camps - and if you do that, you're endorsing blaming and responsibility. Ok, so what are excuses:

**Excuses from Lack of Knowledge**

Sometimes not knowing the result of an action can be an excuse. For example, if you walk along a sidewalk and someone rigged an explosive to go off if you step on a certain tile, and there was no reason whatsoever for you to have expected this very rare situation, you are partially causing the explosion, but you are not morally responsible or blameworthy because there was no way you could have known that.

But that doesn't work here: As a responsible citizen, you should know that drug violence is greatly contributing to all the migration. If you are buying cocaine, you know that it is being smuggled because you can't get it at a pharmacy. On top of that, *if* you are going to break a law, you should suspect that the law prevents something bad. Now, you might have good reasons to break a law after investigating and judging the consequences to not be bad, or even that the law itself is bad. But you have some responsibility to check out what's really going to happen. And in this case, you could easily come to know that, obviously, your cocaine is being smuggled by Central American gangs who inflect massive suffering on their countries. I do not think anyone is excused from not at least suspecting this causal relation to be incredibly likely. This point might be a good place to change my view on this.

**Excuses from forced choices**

Another excuse can be that you had no choice because someone set up a bad situation. Think of (a variation on) the two Ferries in ""The Dark Knight Rises"": The joker tells people on two boats that each of their boat is rigged with explosives and a trigger to blow up the other boat, and if no one blows up the other boat they both go off in 20 minutes. If any group pulls the trigger, they caused the death of the other group, and we can have some deep discussion to what extent this is right or wrong, but at least the setup is a very good candidate for a plausible excuse that makes them not blameworthy or responsible: It's the Joker's fault for setting it up, and their own lives were on the line.

I think *most* people think of this kind of excuse here: ""If the drugs weren't illegal, they wouldn't be funding the gangs, so I'm not responsible for what the gangs do by buying drugs for them.""

I don't buy that excuse for (nearly) all cases. First of all, I specifically excluded Marijuana from the discussion since you could appeal to some self-medicating and such. But we're talking about cocaine. As far as I know, nobody *needs* cocaine. And if there is someone with a medical need for cocaine that can't get it, fine, I'm not talking about them.

So people buy cocaine because they want to (Caveat: More on addiction in a bit). And they do so when they should well know that them buying it *in fact* funds the drug Cartels.

Think again about the two ferries: Imagine one ferry gets a trigger and the Joker tells them: ""You have 20 minutes to blow up the other ferry. If you don't do it, nobody will get any cocaine for 5 years, but nothing else will happen."" This line of argument basically says that an individual desire for cocaine in a (for the sake of the argument) unjustly set up situation is still more important than the lives of the people in Central America. Again, I think that's clearly false, and I think the analogy goes through, even if we tinker with it.

You might say that you're not *directly* killing the kids. But we can modify the ferry: There are 1000 people on board the ferry. Everyone has a button. If 30 people push the button, the other ferry explodes, killing all 1000 people. Everyone is told: ""You keep getting cocaine if you push the button, but if you don't, no cocaine for 5 years. Also, you can push your button very discretely.""

Now, if you push the button, you can say ""well, I didn't cause this alone, and it would have been ineffective to try to force cocaine prohibition on the ferry, so yeah, I pushed my button, and the other ferry blew up, but I'm not to blame!.""

Again, I don't buy the excuse. You can just agree to not have cocaine in order to not contribute to a terrible situation. Now, further, suppose 40 people pushed the button. It can't be the case that all 40 use the excuse of ""well if **I** hadn't pushed it that wouldn't have made a difference. Maybe not, but you already agreed some kind of prohibition by law doesn't work, so the **least** you can do is your part.

We also don't accept this kind of excuse in other areas. You can't be advocating for the Green New Deal while driving your Hummer saying that individual actions don't matter without government action. You can't be discussing the terribly conditions in factory farming and how we should have more regulations over a Veal dinner. That's both hypocritical and no excuse.

You can't complain that the Joker stuck you in a murder-ferry to get your cocaine while pushing the button, and you can't complain about the terrible consequences of the US drug policy while buying cocaine. Well, you can, but you'd be hypocrite of the worst kind.

**Denying degrees of freedom**

My moral-causal principle includes a clause about freely and willingly causing something. And cocaine is an addictive drug. So there are *some* people who are addicted to an degree that they can't be considered to freely choose to purchase it any more - they're literally not able to any more. That makes then not blameworthy by this principle for those purchases. That's not a counterexample to my position though, at least for most cases: Unless your first dose of a drug was administered to you non-consensually (as *Taken* has me believe is sometimes the case with victims of sex-trafficking), you were responsible for taking the first hit. And you should have known that cocaine was addictive and where it comes from. And it doesn't matter how young you were. There are teenagers all over the world protesting climate change. If they can understand climate change, and be responsible about that, they can be responsible for what drugs they start taking.

Second, I have heard many legalization advocates say that cocaine isn't near as addictive as it is sometimes assumed. Wherever things might be: I am committing to the position that there are enough people who are able to choose whether or not to buy and consume cocaine, and that their actions together are a major causal contribution to the global market. So everyone who *can* say 'no' to buying or consuming cocaine is not excused from their role in causing this tragedy.

**Bad excuse: Distance**

But in reality, here is what I think is happening: Suppose the Joker doesn't rig two ferries in Gotham's harbor. But, like the joker, on one ferry there are lots of ""undesirables"" - specifically, brown kids far, far away from where you live. And you're on the ferry, and everyone has a button, and the Joker says ""Anyone who doesn't push the button doesn't get cocaine for five years. But if you do, you get it. And when 5 people push it, it is rigged to kill one parent. And when 15 people push it, it will blow up a family farm. And when 25 people push it, a small explosion will go off in a school that will behead 2 of the 30 children there.

The more people push the button, the worse it will be. And every push brings the situation further and further out of control. But the people are far away, and they look different, and talk different, and you'll never have to face them until you see them on TV and can blame Trump for how he treats them when they ran away from all that. But that's no excuse. That's moral laziness.

Ok, final step, and maybe this will get the most pushback:

**3\. The situation of refugees and asylum seekers at the border is a result of buying cocaine in a non-excusing way.**

This is already long, so I'll try to be quicker here. First, we could argue that there *should* be all sorts of different policies and practices at the border. We shouldn't separate kids from their parents, etc. But since November 2016, we've known that Trump is and will be president. And nobody that doesn't like Trump is surprised by what his administration is overseeing at the border. And it isn't clear that *he* is specifically to blame for the recent rise in people arriving. Even if he is, that's not at all unforeseen. Think of Trump as the Joker in those other scenarios if you like. He's holding kids in asylum camps refuge, saying he'll withdraw education and care funds if they keep coming, and he's telling you ""If you just didn't buy any cocaine, this wouldn't be happening..."" On that characterization Trump is a moral monster, using little kids as hostage on people that might, for the sake of the argument, have a legitimate liberty rights to consume cocaine. I'll grant you all that: Still, playing along is wrong, doesn't help, and makes it worse. So anyone that buys cocaine is, without an excuse, significantly responsible and blameworthy for the situation. They're clearly causally contributing by funding the gangs. And I don't see any significant excuse, no matter how horrible Trump might be acting. 
As a last point: Of course not everyone at the border is fleeing drug violence in particular. But part of what makes things so bad is the number of people arriving, and it is indisputable that if there was less drugs bought, there would be (over time) less gang activity, which would lead to less violence, and in turn to less refugees. 

And that's how I get to the view in the title, that 

**People who bought and continue to buy cocaine are significantly responsible and blameworthy for the bad conditions of migrants at the southern US border.**

Ok, that was *really* long. But I got so much flack on my other post that I wanted to lay this out in detail. I hope I've given lots of places to make arguments to CMV.

Looking forward to the discussion!",c2l767,"Can you expand on what you mean by blame? Blame has social repercussions. Are you arguing that we should punish cocaine users more harshly, for instance, or socially ostracize them, and label them as bad people? 

My problem here is that doing this would accomplish very little, as addicts are already generally miserable and ostracized, and would distract from directing blame towards centers of power that might actually able to improve conditions in Central America — eg, institutions in charge of foreign policy (we recently cut off foreign aid for much of Central America), that write drug laws, that are in charge of the war on drugs. You can accomplish more by blaming the powerful, because they actually have the power to change things. Blaming the weak doesn’t do much.",erkx5bq,2.8
Tipping should not be expected.,"I find it incredible that tipping is expected for good friendly service. 

The job role of a server is to provide good service. Why should the customer pay extra to contribute to the wage of someone just for doing their job? I know there is an argument for them
not being paid enough, but surely its up to the employer to reward their own employees for doing a good job? Not for it to be expected for the customer.  

Furthermore people who provide a friendly good service while working in retail or fast food are not expected to be tipped, so what’s the difference? Its infuriating that million dollar restaurant chains pay their staff barely liveable wage and the customers are made to look the bad guy if they don’t pay extra towards the wage of the serving staff?

Maybe i’m being completely short sighted and wrong. Im interested to see what everyone else thinks about this topic so fire away!",nv3g1t,"\&gt;Furthermore people who provide a friendly good service while working in retail or fast food are not expected to be tipped, so what’s the difference?

Generally retail cashiers or fast food workers interact with you for about a minute there's not much quality of service to evaluate. Coffee shops where a greater degree of service skill (making sometimes complicated drinks) is involved do tend to have tip jars.

It's not a perfect breakout, but there is a general logic to what kinds of work are tipped and which aren't. Extended or more skill based interactions where the customer has an opportunity to evaluate the service given are more likely to be tipped. Brief interactions, and ones involving less skill personability or choice are less likely to be tipped. I think the main exceptions are things that involve trust like valets (you don't have a lengthy interaction, or expect great skill) or on the other end, well compensated service occupations like dental hygenist.

The other main factor is ease of tipping. Generally tipped jobs are jobs where it's easy to pay both the employee and the main bill at the same time. That means when the bill comes due, you've already had an interaction with the employee and time to evaluate it.

Some retail stores where employees provide a lot of service to customers use commissions for a similar motivating effect. But this only works in fairly high value industries like electronics or cars where making the sale is the prime thing owners want to incentivize, rather than repeat business, recommendation and good reviews which is what restaurants want.

The general idea is that tips act as a direct market force more or less, where good service is rewarded. Managers and owners can't really watch every customer interaction like a hawk, so their ability to motivate and reward good service directly is limited. You may have noticed some places where tipping is not practiced are much more likely to use things like customer surveys, mystery shoppers etc. All businesses want to monitor and incentivize employee service. In some industries, tipping has been seen as a way to do that.",h11br2x,4.5
Max Verstappen is the legitimate 2021 Formula World Champion.,"I will start by saying that the choice made by Michael Masi under pressure in Abu Dhabi were not correct. It was not a one race champion ship, it was a 22 race championship, and the perceived affect of one race has been over estimated by most people simply because it happened last. Abu Dhabi had no more affect on the championship than any other prior race. Max won the championship in France, Austin, Monaco, Imola, and Zandvoort, just as much as he won it in Abu Dhabi. 

The simple fact of the matter is Lewis made more mistakes throughout the season and was honestly lucky to still be in the title fight by the final race. Lewis put his car into the gravel in Imola and was lucky to have the mistake go ""unpunished"" due to a fortunate safety car. Lewis made the mistake in Silverstone which caused Max to crash into the barriers in Silverstone, and again came away with no real ""punishment"" for the mistake. Lewis made an unforced error in Baku after Max had his tire explode causing him to miss out on an 18 or 25 point gain on Max (which in hindsight would have one him the championship). Lewis had an absolute trash weekend in Monaco which caused him to give up a ton of points to Max. Lewis chose the wrong tires on the restart of the race in Hungary which ultimately caused him to give up an additional 7 points. in a race where Max was relegated to the back because Bottas went bowling. 

Compare this to Max's season, who did have luck on his side on a few occasions (Belgium comes to mind). However, Max had an almost perfect season with the only real clear mistake being in Monza, and arguably in Bahrain. His other DNF in Baku was of no fault of his own, and his only finish outside of the top two came down to the aforementioned bowling incident. Max WAS the better driver of the course of the season.

Abu Dhabi gets special attention because it happened last. If instead all other events being equal Abu Dhabi and Austin had each others places on the calendar the outrage simply wouldn't exist.",uingh1,"I’m a redbull fan boy and hate Mercedes, however that last race was a huge difference maker and Hamilton was pulling on those last few laps…could be just the way it goes where sometimes you get the luck sometimes you don’t however going into that race it wasn’t a question of who should be the winner, it came down to the race. And Hamilton got screwed",i7dp8by,2.4
Schools are too authoritative.,"
There is the obvious comparison to prison and most people shrug it off, but having a large fence around a school, having teachers demand authority and respect by only answering to their surnames and being able to give direct commands instead of asking nicely all seem a bit far fetched to me.

It all bears a strange resemblance to the Zimbardo Prison experiment, which was an interesting insight into conformity. They simulated a prison and everyone who was handed authority on a silver platter abused it, whilst those stripped of their respect were forced to obey.

In my opinion, while it may prepare children to follow the law once they leave school, I don’t think it’s the best way to go about it. There’s a distinct lack of freedom and two way respect in the system that bugs me from time to time. 

I know for a fact that this isn’t an effective way of teaching because the kind of toxic environment schools are today and likely always have been can cause depression in the young and impressionable children attending.

Don’t get me started on patriotism in schools. Schools in a fair few countries serve a secondary purpose to indoctrinate their students into a way of thinking that may be downright dangerous. “Stand for the flag”, “Sing the Anthem”. However my main grievance with this is one thing that a buddy of mine from Oklahoma told me about:

In the US (and I’m not flaming the US because I’m from England and we’re also guilty of this) there’s a curriculum that, if I remember correctly, is called JROTC. JROTC is near enough the antithesis of the poem Dulce Et Decorum Est, a poem that is very anti-war. The poem is about the lies they were told when enlisting, and I guess whilst it’s not entirely relevant, somewhere in my monkey brain I can see JROTC as being a thing to entice young people to put their whole lives into becoming part of the Corps. 

That last paragraph was very rambly and I’m very sorry for wasting everyone’s time with it, but I just needed to get it off my chest. Please, discuss with me.",urt1ff,"speaking as someone who wasn't a part of JROTC in high school but was in ROTC throughout college, I'm a bit confused as to your antipathy towards the program.

"The Last of Us 2 did not have a bad story, and in many ways had a good story (Spoilers)","The majority sentiment at the moment is that not only did The Last of Us 2 have a bad story, but it had the absolute worst story. Bad enough that it took a game with amazing graphics, compelling gameplay, well thought out set pieces, and good pacing, and made it a 3.6/10. In my opinion, since the game would easily have been an 8-9/10 based on those positive factors alone, the general gaming audience is stating that this story is objectively bad. This is completely incorrect, and will only serve to decrease the quality of games going forward.

This is where the spoilers begin, so turn back now if you don't know the story yet.

It is abundantly clear that the main reason the vast majority of naysayers think the story is ""trash"" is because Joel dies. This is obviously the most simple minded and dare I say low IQ reaction to have. These people were obviously very invested in Joel as a character, and therefore invested in the entire Last of Us universe. A universe in which peril is ubiquitous in all activities in life. A universe in which an early death is all but guaranteed. Yet these people expect main characters to be invincible.

Those who can rationalize away their preference for immortal heroes and low stake encounters then turn to criticizing the manner in which Joel died. I assume these people wanted an explosion filled set piece where Joel sacrifices himself for a busload of small children, and delivers a heart warming soliloquy shortly before slowly closing his eyes and drifting away. Once again, this simply does not match up with the reality of the game that people became fans of. If anything, this is the absolutely most meaningful way Joel could have died. Finally being brought down by all the unbridled violence that he committed in the first installment. But that would mean suffering consequences for actions, which it seems the gaming audience cannot stand the concept of.

The one thing that I can understand is the handling of the antagonist Abby. There are some choices which I don't find to be objectively bad, but are very questionable, and probably just weren't executed perfectly. While Joel's death is not bad writing at all, it obviously does achieve the goal of creating a strong emotional reaction in the player, a lot of which involves hatred for Abby. To then have the player take control of Abby and play as her is not completely without merit, and does not immediately doom the game, but it is something that has to be earned first, and I don't think it is. Eventually the player does (or should) begin to understand the antagonist and paint them in a much more favorable light, but it comes slowly and doesn't do much to get rid of that initial bad taste.

Finally the ending. Its not a happy one, not at all. It also **isn't original** and has been seen many times before. Audiences with well developed minds and at least a basic taste in general media should have encountered this story before, and even a 12 year old can understand the simplest interpretation of the message. Revenge doesn't work out. Its not even that the ending is unearned.

The only motivation to use crypto in a transaction instead of regular currency is nefarious transactions.,"I've held this view for the past decade and would really like to have it challenged and maybe even changed.

While I'm not a decision maker in this area, I do have a professional exposure (within an echo chamber) regarding it. I'd like to hear outside opinions regarding the subject. 

Important to clarify that I'm referring to the majority of situations. I'm sure there's fringe cases that could apply to a specific uncommon scenario, but we can't shape policy around outliers. My view is the following:

In the majority of cases, the only logical reason to prefer using cryptocurrencies (IE: bitcoin) for a transaction instead of using regular currencies is the lack of traceability of the transaction. It stands to reason that the only reason one would want to consistently hide transactions from banks is to avoid BSA departments who only file reports to FINCEN when they meet parameters for analysis to determine if there is any illegal activity. Anyone who isn't involved in illegal activity has nothing to worry about from FINCEN as they will simply analyze the information and close the case if no laws are being broken.",u6dzsu,"If it's really World War III, how will crypto valuations scale against ""pinned"" currencies? If my country's currency hyperinflates, will crypto be a hedge against that? If the federal reserve prints more dollars, I can't control that, but I can buy crypto.

I have no crypto. I've never had crypto. I don't plan to get crypto. I hate seeing this ""crypto is just for criminals to buy and sell people and drugs"" thing.

Going back to traceability - you can install WannaCry at your hospital and get $50k in bitcoin and no one will know it's you, but if you use that bitcoin to buy goods or services that benefit just a few people or just you then the game is over. The transaction is known to be you, it was shipped to your house, and it wasn't a setup, okay it was you.",i593zzw,2.6666666666666665
If we can celebrate historical figures who were great by modern standards then we can also not celebrate them if we judge some of their actions to be too problematic by modern standards,"This is a pretty simple one. People often say we shouldn’t judge historical figures by modern standards. This does make sense on the face of it, they lived in a different time and context, it’s unreasonable to expect people to not fall short by the standards of people living hundreds of years later, it’s simply human nature to broadly display the values of your own society, even if you buck the trend in a few highly significant areas (see the founding fathers of the US pursuing liberty but also owning slaves). 

The thing is, if it’s reasonable to say that we shouldn’t judge them, why does it follow that we should therefore celebrate them for what we see as good things they did? If we can look back and say that a historical figure did good things, despite being potentially hated in their time by certain groups (I’m sure king George and parliament did not look to favourably on the rebellious Americans) for actions that we now see as good, we can we not look back in disgust at actions which may at the time have been considered normal?

TL;DR if we can praise the actions of historical figures which today we say as being good, why can we not condemn them for actions which we today see as bad?

"Borders of countries are wrong morally, or at least the “right” of making a decision as to who can and can’t come in is wrong and has no basis in morality.","This question perplexes me and I have given it much thought over the past few years.

My basic premise is that there is no argument for giving people(and therefore governments) the right to exclude people from entering a country and using their services and facilities. 

If we start from the beginning, what gives someone a right to have citizenship? For the most part it’s birth. Now this is something out of the control of the individual, and yet this gives one an ultimate claim to enjoy the benefits or detriments of that country. There is no choice in being born in say a poor country and therefore being set on a path to exclusion from countries rife with opportunities. It is luck and luck is no basis for a morale standing.

Now the other aspect is what gives the collective people of a country the right to exclude people. Well if we can assume we all subscribe to a partial belief in the supremacy of democracy, one of its core tenants is that laws are given legitimacy by the fact that all people had a say in the laws enacting. Therefore, as everyone had a say over that law(even if indirectly through the lawmakers we voted in(present American debacle is not up for discussion)) the law is an acceptable one. This doesn’t give legitimacy to laws surrounding immigration as the people who are subject to the laws have no say in the enacting of such laws and suffer a detriment of being excluded from a country based on these laws. Therefore, there is no justification to legislate in regards to immigration as this is a form of tyranny and not democracy which I think we can accept as a morally reprehensible form of government. 

I am open to arguments for some moral justification, the whole “a country only has a finite amount of resources to provide for x amount of citizens” is not a worthy argument in my eyes as it is a practical justification and not a moral justification. 

I am also speaking as someone who has emigrated from South Africa to the UK and am now a British citizen (I was 5)",kxqncx,Why can't a practical basis be a part of moral basis?

Food's not blue,"This is something my grandpa taught me and something he followed his whole life.  Now I believe and practice this.  The application is pretty simple:  if it's blue, don't eat it.

There's no natural food that's actually blue.  Some typical examples I get are blueberries, blue corn, blue potatoes, and blue cheese.  These are all purple.  Blueberries look kinda blue cause they have a white coating on them, but no, that's a purple food once you wash it.  If you ever see some blueberry drink that's actually blue, they added some bullshit non-food to it to make it blue.

There're also crustaceans that're blue.  Well, their shells are blue.  That's how you can be extra sure not to eat the shell.  The meat's a delicious shade of not blue.

What about edible blue flowers?  This is a borderline one.  Yea, it's technically edible.  So is grass.  They're not food, they're just things you can ingest without harming yourself.  Not blue food.

Blue is not an appetizing color to me.  I've never had any sort of blue drink that tasted like anything except a concoction of chemicals.  It may be delicious, but so is blue antifreeze.  Leave it its normal color, or dye it the color of some food, and I'll eat it.

A weaker form of this argument is: you're better off just never eating anything blue.  I think that's good advice for any kid.  I'm sticking with the original strong form of the argument, though: food is not blue.",o92pbc,The pen is,h39855h,1.0
To make an inquiry to discover if someone is interested in sexual relations is not sexual harassment.,"I had a debate with someone &amp; they believe simply asking for sex is harassing someone.

I completely disagree. 

I believe if someone is not in a business setting (two coworkers or a boss and an employee) or not acting in a professional capacity (one person is on the job and the other is not [visiting the doctor, teacher/professor, a waiter, the person helping you at Lowe’s]), it is not harassing them to see if they are interested in sex.

Say if you’re waiting at the gate for your plane and you ask another person at the gate if they are interested in joining the mile high club. If you’re at a bar and approach someone and you immediately ask if they want to come back home with you:

I am also not talking about going at it in a foul manner. Like before simply asking, making any sexually charged comments. 

But literally... if you just walk up to a stranger and say “excuse me, would you be interested in x(sexual behavior)?”

That action is not sexual harassment.
Now if the answer is no and then the person continues to proposition them, ask why, why, why and so on, yes that becomes harassment. 

But literally just asking if they would be interested in doing x, is not sexual harassment.",kpuzb2,"It’s definitely not harassment, based off the definition of the word, but the approach may violate that person in another way, so still probably not a good idea.

If health care is a human right then unhealthy choices are a societal wrong. This contradicts individual liberty.,"For context, I am a liberal in the US. I'm for single payer healthcare because I think it addresses how un-free the health care market is due to information asymmetry. I'm not convinced of the position ""healthcare is a human right"" because of the statements in this post's title. I believe the human right argument contradicts with individual liberty - the ""freedom to make bad decisions"" since such decisions would directly increase public health care costs. Also I know anyone can see the ER, but I don't think this qualifies as anyone's complete idea of ""health care"".

Edit: 34 comments later and not a single person has even addressed the fundamental contradiction I'm trying to get at. I'm not saying it's wrong to spend public money. I'm not saying it's wrong to make personal decisions. I'm asking specifically if Universal Health Care was a human right, wouldn't an individual need to curb their personal liberty to make healthier decisions to minimize their health care costs?

I'm asking this specifically because I think there's a better alternative argument for single payer that avoids this contradiction. I wasn't sure if I believed in health care as a human right before, but I'm pretty convinced there's no argument for it now.",n3j72v,"I think what is meant by ""healtcare is a human right"" is that everybody should have acces to healthcare. From a liberal point of view, you can see it as: everybody should be free to visit a docter (and get treatment if needed). When healthcare is too expensive, it isn't available for everybody. That means that rich people will have the freedom to visit a docter while poor people will not have that 'individual liberty'.",gwq6221,3.2

Number 1: Safety.

Number 2:  Cost Of Living.

Living in America. In some places are actually pretty affordable. But the cost of healthcare is prohibitively expensive. There are many countries where the cost of healthcare is free at the point of service. Or drastically reduced in pricing.

For instance a family of four in Portugal can spend 1500 a year in private healthcare costs.  Also I'm looking at other places but in terms of healthcare affordability we rank number one in terms of cost for healthcare.

Number 3: Work Life Balance 

Here in the states there is hustle culture. Which is getting at all cost. It's all up to you. Which I definitely do partake in. Bunch at the same time sometimes it could seem like you can take a backseat to interpersonal relationships. You're so focused on trying to succeed in America. Even when you do have interpersonal encounters. The first thing that we ask in this country is what do you do?

you only get one life to live. And I think that you should be able to balance life and work. And I feel like culturally here we don't do that. Which may lead to an unhappy or life for some people not all.  

Those are my reasons guys. I would love to hear what I may be missing. But thanks in advance. 

Also as a note. Just so people understand. I really do care about this country. But I always have to contest with the fact that this country seems from the data that I've collected and the stories that I see in the news that it doesn't care about me.

Corporate Presence at Pride Parades and Rainbow Capitalism should be welcomed,"Around this time of year I often see posts and articles from people criticising ""rainbow capitalism"" and related involvement of corporations in Pride movements in the West. These people often point out that Pride began as some sort of protest or riot, and should continue in this vein. They would prefer that Pride parades are run solely as protests against continuing injustices against LGBT people.

I have always thought myself that so-called rainbow capitalism and corporate presence at Pride parades was a welcome sight as it was a sign of a society that has moved to a point where these entities feel emboldened to embrace the LGBT community. I feel it's really positive that in the West being LGBT has become this level of normal that corporations feel free to participate in these events without backlash. I also think it sends a strong message to less-accepting societies that we have strong values of tolerance, and that entities that have a huge influence on the world we live in are supportive of LGBT rights.

I struggle to understand why someone wouldn't feel this way and would prefer the Pride events to be some sort of celebration of oppression rather than a celebration of freedom.  I'm gay myself btw if that matters.",hdtkcl,"Best example, Bethesda.

The concept of gratitude journals encourages toxic positivity,"Gratitude journals may work for some people out there, but seriously for a lot of people including me, the entire idea seems poppycock. 

It’s much better to journal or voice one’s gratitude for things one is truly grateful for; such as situations in which you dodged a bullet (metaphorically and literally), something great happened to you, you met up with someone amazing. You saw a rainbow. Things like that. 

Listing a bunch of things such as the sunset or sunrise or rain or tap water or food in gratitude journal made me feel like I was being dishonest with myself and I was so deep in denial that it took many months to get over toxic positivity BS I was imbibing. 

Another reason I don’t like gratitude journals is that it forces you to draw comparison : essentially between the haves and have nots. It compels you to evaluate things you have that others don’t.

therapy is a scam,"I've tried dozens of therapy, it goes the same way every Time.

"Christianity by itself is great for humanity, it’s only bad when people hijack it for selfish gain","I think the core tenets of Christianity have been great for humanity. Themes such as humility, non-violence, forgiveness, unconditional love, caring for the weak, being opposed to materialism. and self love. Yes I suppose this type of morality is possible without religion but it’s in my opinion it’s easier for people to truly believe these things if they are raised religious, as opposed to being raised an atheist which makes it more likely for one to become nihilistic.

Yes this is just an anecdote but in my small town there was no homeless shelter until the church built one. And I know in many other small towns, churches are the only place to turn if you have nowhere else to go. There are many non religious organizations in my town who never bothered to help the homeless at all.

Christianity has been used to manipulate the masses into countless wars and used as a tool of oppression but really this isn’t because of the teachings of Christianity but because of people who hijack it and use peoples faith for selfish reasons. There are many other righteous movements like BIm or Communism that were hijacked by bad people and led to murder and violence, does that mean the ideologies themselves are bad? No, just that people should be wary of blindly following dogmatic leaders.

Men having children after the age of 50 is unfair to the child,"The average life expectancy for a male in the U.S. is what, 75 years old? That means if a man has children at age 55 he'll potentially have 20 years with them - assuming he's in good health. He might be able to squeeze out an additional 10 - 15 years old life which means that he'll be leaving his kids behind when they're in they're 30's which is still far too young.

Men having children beyond the age of 50 limits the length of their interaction with their kids. It is also a burden for the children because having an elderly parent means that they likely lack the energy to do fun, engaging activities.

If a man has a child at age 30 then there is no guarantee that he will live long enough to see his kids reach their 40's. However, he is definitely more likely to see that than a 50 year old man is.

Donald Trump is an Authoritarian Who Should be Removed from Office as Quick as Possible.,"There are three basic characteristics of an authoritarian: 

1. Projecting Strength
2. Demonising Enemies
3. Destabilising Institutions

Trump has done/attempted to do all 3. He wanted a [military parade](https://www.ft.com/content/41341368-9ddb-11e9-b8ce-8b459ed04726), has demonised immigrants for as long as everyone can remember and has constantly tried to interfere with institutions. For example, he tried to shut down the Mueller investigation and tried to prevent a CNN reporter from entering the white house. 

He has also committed more authoritarian actions, such as the recent deployment of secret police in unmarked vans in Portland, Oregon. He has also claimed any result he doesn't like is voter fraud. ALongside tat, he has managed to create a cult of personality, despite being a hypocrite in every sense of the word. He literally has a subreddit regarding his hypocrisy ( r/TrumpCriticizesTrump ). *Politifacts* has fact-checked him and [70%](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/) of his statements as of now have been labelled as false. He has said that he will not accept the November results if they are not in his favour.

The worst of all is his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. He has allowed it to spread beyond any other country and fueled scepticism regarding the effectiveness of masks(until recently). He now wants to reopen schools despite how terrible an idea that will be. The USA under his guidance has reached almost 25% of all Covid-19 deaths in the world. And yet people still support him beyond belief.",hxkv52,"Immigration and naturalization has been a political issue going as far back as the late 1700s following independence.

Dog breeds are animal cruelty,"Dog breeds are invented construct. Modern breeds started when rich folk in 19th century started inbreeding dogs. They created so called “pure breeds” just because they keep having kids with their siblings and cousins.

Main reason why I think this is animal cruelty are the health issues. Purebred dogs have more health problems than mutts (or mongrel). They have shorter lifespan, some flat faced dogs are literally suffocating all the time and some purebreds cannot even mate without external help. People are selecting visual traits and creating genetic diseases on the way. Worst of all is that breeding dogs actually [makes them dumber](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/4283328/Pedigree-dogs-are-becoming-stupid-as-we-breed-them-for-looks-not-brains.html).

Advocates of breeding also bring up benefits of the practice. They would say that you can breed certain behaviour but large [meta-analysis have contested this idea](https://www.nationalcanineresearchcouncil.com/research-library/summary-analysis-breed-differences-everyday-behaviour-dogs). Dogs behaviour is not dictated by the breed or genetics but differences in upbringing and owner reported bias. Dog types (like breeds) is made up classification that doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. Differences within type are larger than differences between types. You can also think this anecdotally. If I can find one unenergetic husky that means that I should look for individual traits instead of breed traits, because latter don’t exist.
[About 40% of seeing eye dogs ""change careers"".](https://www.seeingeye.org/assets/pdfs/the-seeing-eye-by-the-numbers.pdf) That's not much better than tossing a coin. Clearly you cannot breed dogs to become seeing eye dogs. This is what I mean that you cannot just pick a breed and say ""this breed has X trait"".

One argument for dog breeds might be that most domestic animals are bred for one purpose. Cows, pigs or chicken are all inbreed with health issues. But two wrongs don’t make right. And at least we breed those animals for their meat or milk but dog breeding is all about aesthetics and have no real benefits.

TL;DR: Dog breading is animal cruelty because it creates health problems only so we can have cute looking dogs. To change my mind tell me why I should get a “purebred” instead of a mutt.",j1uz9s,"The analysis is based on owner perception and is flawed for that reason.  They mention that their findings are different from others, which lead them to believe the tool lacks validity.  

Dog breeds do get trained for specific tasks, at least some breeds.  And some breeds have better innate physicality to perform those skills.  Like, don't expect a boxer to go swimming, that's a terrible idea.  

There is value to purebreds because of consistency of expectation.  If you want a specific type of fur, a skill, a hypoallergenic, you might choose a pure breed. But mutts are awesome dogs too. They can have genetic issues as well, but less likely.  

If you are breeding, you should be screening for all the genetic and health issues and *not* breeding a dog that has those traits.  You should also be showing or otherwise competing with the dog to ensure they are achieving the skill or appearance that is correct. 

Unfortunately there are a *lot* of ""backyard breeders"".  They should stop.  Responsible breeders I have a hard time getting it up for.",g71j7d4,4.8

Taxing wealth in the form of cash is easy enough, but as the assets become more volatile or less frequently traded, things become difficult. I'll admit I haven't yet seen her answers on how to deal with this, but how do you tax a stock holding that doubled in value over the year, or to take it even further an art collection? Capital gains does not have this ambiguity, since it requires a purchase and a sale.

**It discourages investment and capital accumulation.** It's generally agreed that capital accumulation is a strong driver of economic development. Introducing a wealth taxes encourages consumption spending with no value gained afterwards. Innovative companies and risky large scale projects heavily rely on investments from the wealthy. Without steady returns, wealthy investors would likely shy away from these investments in favor of low risk investments or consumption spending.

**There's a philosophical difference between taxing a transfer and taxing fixed wealth.** Most taxes are taken as skimming from a transaction. I know property taxes are an exception, but I disagree with them on the same grounds.  There is a fundamental difference between taking a portion of economic activity and taking a constant payment from citizens.

**Although this is a rare situation, it can cause an unfair burden for people with relatively illiquid wealth.** For early investors in companies, or people who inherit large estates it may be difficult to come up with the payment. If your wealth is in illiquid forms it would be difficult to sell as well.",bwi2yw,"complicated:  Agreed, but so are transaction-based taxes.  One factor that makes this easier;  a wealth tax system makes citizens and companies WANT to report payments and sales of stuff, and for how much, to the IRS- so they don't get taxed on that stuff next year.  This would be useful in determining the value of say, an art collection, a car, or a home.  Regarding what value, over the course of a given year, do we tax stuff at:  we just need to pick a consistent system e.g. the AVERAGE value over the course of the entire year, or the value AT the end of the year, whichever is lower.  Still, I agree that the STARTUP work, to determine what every person's assets are worth, (before it's sale has been reported), is huge!

&amp;#x200B;

Discourages investment:  It actually does the opposite.  Whether we leave it as cash under our mattresses or invest it in the stock market- it still is wealth that gets taxed.  Why WOULDN'T I want to invest it, in an attempt to make as much profit as possible with it?  If I make enough profit to cover the tax bill on it, my wealth can increase.  If I leave it under the mattress, my wealth is GUARANTEED to decrease.  I must admit, it DOES encourage HIDING ones wealth from tax authorities, and obviously, that hidden wealth cannot be invested.  But, then again, all tax systems ""encourage"" fraud like this, it's only the penalty one pays when busted (jail), that discourages it.

&amp;#x200B;

Philosophical:  This is the best reason to implement a wealth tax:  only those capable of actually earning enough money to cover their wealth tax would get wealthier.  Those who were simply given their wealth, but don't have the capability to maintain it, will over time, lose it.  

&amp;#x200B;

Liquidity:  This is indeed an issue with a wealth-tax.  One workaround would be to, allow the taxpayer to specify a non-liquid asset they own as collateral, and allow the IRS to ""accumulate"" the taxes owed, over multiple years.  When liquid one can pay off the bill. Or, if the bill becomes as large as the collateral itself, that asset can be seized to eliminate the bill.  Admittedly, not ideal, and potentially a lot more work for the tax agency seizing and selling stuff.

One last thing to mention:  the wealth tax rate would be FAR lower rate than a transaction based tax rate because the ""base"" being taxed is so much larger (so a much lower percentage rate would be able to provide the same total income for the IRS.)",epzgdlh,4.2
The existence of an infinite multiverse would not imply that infinite copies of earth exist,"I see this sort of argument from philosophers and from science popularizers like Brian Greene and Max Tegmark, but it makes no sense to me. The basic idea is explained in this video [Are there Infinite Versions of You? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qT110-Q8PJI), but pretty much the argument is that according to the infinite multiverse model based on eternal inflation, there would most likely exist infinite copies of earth and everybody on it in other bubble universes. The logic relies on a variation of the ""infinite monkey theorem"", in which an infinite number of attempts would eventually lead to any possibility happening with probability 1.

&amp;#x200B;

This logic does not seem to apply to the universe, however, because the possible configurations for the universe are infinite rather than finite. Because spacetime is continuous, there are an uncountably infinite number of ways that particles and atoms can be configured relative to one another.  So rather than choosing between different keys on a typewriter, you're effectively dividing infinity by infinity. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But even if one were to accept that the number of possible configurations were finite, then that still doesn't seem to imply that any one of those configurations need be repeated even once. Since each configuration would have some likelihood of occurring then it would be just as likely that only a certain subset of configurations repeats infinitely while the rest don't repeat at all, and since there would be a vast number of possible configurations, the odds that any one of them would necessarily repeat would still be low.

&amp;#x200B;

So, the probability of earth recurring even once, let alone infinite times, seems incredibly low even in an infinite multiverse.",szuj0n,"The key word here is infinite. 

You are correct in saying there would be an infinite amount of combinations of atoms and what not so you wouldn't necessarily have an exact copy of you all the time...

But that doesn't change the fact there are infinite universes in this theory. So even if less than 1% of these infinite universes have you, there's still an infinite amount. They are still being made. Ergo there is an infinite number of you. Just not you, other you. 

To me this would also mean there are an infinite number of variations of you. So maybe different hair colour etc. 

Either way though infinite is infinite I don't see how you can argue against that? Unless I'm too small brain to get what you're saying which is equally possible.",hyd0ux7,3.6
All police body cams should publicly livestream everything they do,"We should have a website which livestreams every cop's bodycam for the public to view. If they are not doing anything wrong, then there should be nothing to hide. A mute button could be placed on the camera for taking names and ID, and implementing an AR code on government ID for the camera to track and blur it would be trivial (portable video game systems from 2011 were capable of this, e.g. the 3DS). We could also allow the cops to disable the livestream for tactical reasons if absolutely necessary. Obviously if they resorted to this, their decision would be placed under administrative scrutiny.

"Masters Degrees Straight After Earning Your Undergrad, is Unwise","Now hear me out, I’m not saying that a masters or even a PhD are useless, they represent hard work, dedication, discipline, and some of the highest levels of education out there. My mother was a PhD but she got it when she was in her 50s! She took time to work and raise a family then she went back. But that is neither here nor there.

My main viewpoint is that graduating from undergrad and going into a masters program is useless and only hurts the majority of students doing it more. I know maybe 20 friends and acquaintances who did this and they’re now complaining about the debt they’ve racked up ranging anywhere between $80k-$120k in loans! I could buy a house with that money or at least use it as a down payment! I can’t imagine that kind of debt! But now the majority of them are unemployed. Sure they are smart, but not smart enough to see they are now overqualified for a majority of job openings that are out there. 

Now from my understanding is that once you have worked a number of years and are working your way up in most major businesses, they can or will sponsor you to go get a masters in light of a promotion. So, why not wait? I’ve worked now for 4 years, worked my last year of college, and I have worked off my student debt and now have a decent job where I’m well liked and respected because I’ve worked my way up from the bottom and the owners of the business already enjoy having me around and it’s only been a week.

All I’m saying is going straight out of earning and undergrad and going to graduate school is foolish, because you are usually overqualified for most starting positions for those with little to no work experience, which you usually are, and you’re in deep debt that you chose to go through, rather than work till you’ve paid off your initial student loans or have a company sponsor you to get a masters. I am not saying earning these titles in life are a bad thing or should be looked down upon, I’m saying you should earn work experience before increasing your level of education, because in the long run it won’t do you much good doing it right after undergrad.",n7e7cz,"This is *highly* dependent on the field.

Masters in Business, Education, and Law have a lot of value in placing for jobs - in many other fields, masters degrees don’t do a lot.

Libertarian free will is completely inconsistent with reality and is ultimately absurd,"First defining terms. I'm specifically referring to libertarian free will. I'm not talking about compatibilist versions of free will. 

Libertarian free will I'm specifically defining as the idea that if we ""ran back the clock"" of our lives, we could have done otherwise. In other words, our decisions aren't made until we make them. 

I have problems with the compatibilist view but I don't consider it to absurd. The compatibilist view being that as long as the causes of our actions are ""internal"" rather than ""external"" they are free decisions. For example voting for someone because I want to is a decision made from my own ""free will""  as opposed to the voting for someone because they had a gun to my head. The Compatibilist would still argue that even in the first case I was ""always"" going to vote for who I ended up voting for. The libertarian free will person will say that it wasn't determined before hand who I was going to vote for. I wasn't going to vote for the person I ended up voting for until I ""decided"" to. Its this second view I'm arguing against here.

Argument from physics:

Special relativity tells us there is no such thing as a universal present. Its highly suggestive of a block theory or eternalist view of the universe in which the past present and future are all equally real and have already ""happened"". In other words our perception of the flow of time that we currently live in the present, and are moving towards the future is an illusion. This view of time obviously precludes libertarian free will as it says our future has already happened. The ability to do otherwise requires a present in which we make decisions. If the present doesn't exist we cant make decisions. 

Argument from neurology: 

Our minds seem to be a product  of our brains. When we change the brain it changes behavior and consciousness. We can also correlate brain activity with specific behavior and conscious experience. Our brains follow predictable laws of physics. If our behavior is determined by the activity of our brains, and the activity of our brains is determined by physical laws, then our behavior is determined by physical laws not by us. 

Argument from experience/philosophy: 

To quote Schopenhauer ""we can do what we will, but we cannot will what we will."" Free will in the libertarian sense requires us to be able to ""make ourselves"" a murderer doesn't choose to desire murderering, he doesn't choose  to care or not about right and wrong, he doesn't choose how much willpower he has ( which most psychological research suggests is a finite resource of the brain), he doesn't choose to be amenable to arguments or not. etc. So in what possible sense is he responsible for his actions",syqrth,Your extrapolation of Special Relativity is highly questionable. The fact that each body in the universe experiences time in direct correlation to their spacial velocity does not imply that the future has already happened.,hxz79ex,1.8
Private car insurance companies are bad and this function would better be served by the state,"Private insurance companies are motivated by profit. They are therefore inclined to find any excuse not to pay out on claims, which causes problems. It's also just more expensive to the consumer.

It seems like a better system would be to have the state increase road tax rates and use this money to effectively act as an insurance company, only without being driven by profit. This would be cheaper for drivers, fairer for people who need to make claims against someone, and it completely eliminates the problem of uninsured drivers which therefore also saves money in policing. If the state makes profit of insurance, the extra money could be reinvested in the state which saves the taxpayer money elsewhere or gives them a better service.

I think private insurance companies should still exist so that people can insure extra things if they want to (e.g. tyre insurance), but a system where the state effectively requires you to be insured by a private company is a bad idea- why not cut out the middleman and have the state provide insurance from road tax?",nytc9t,"Depends on where you live. In Canada the insurance companies don't make profit off auto insurance. They've been losing money on that segment for a while. They used to make money off investments prior to 2008. Once the economy crashed, so did their cash cow. Now they try to do smart underwriting to make money. The highest profits usually come from property insurance.

They anticipate losing money on auto but will make it up from property. The private companies here are governed by FSCO which is a government entity.

You do need a government entity to make the rules. We have government ombudsmen and arbitrators that help settle issues. Insurance companies are afraid to go to court with the little guy, often times the court will side with the claimant and give stiff penalties if an insurance company tries to hold claims.

It depends on where you live.",h1ol516,4.4
Not changing the tracks in the trolley problem is a selfish act.,"I’m not saying it’s wrong, but I think that it stems from self-interest. If you choose not to take one life to save more, then essentially, it’s because you care more about the moral burden of killing a person than you care about the lives of the people on the trolley’s path. People tend to believe that they have a greater moral responsibility to not to harm themselves than to prevent harm. If we choose to allow something bad to happen, we absolve ourselves of responsibility because we weren’t the direct cause of it, while we feel guiltier when we’re the ones who directly cause harm. Nothing wrong with that, it’s just how our ethical system is wired, but I do believe that the fundamental motivation in not choosing to change the tracks of the trolley is because it’s easier for us to reconcile ourselves with allowing death to happen than causing it.",j2cese,"It can be a selfish act but it does not need to be. The guilt may be a reflection of unease with doing something which is normally immoral or it may be a recognition that it actually is immoral.


What if I want to feel guilty when I do bad things so that I am less likely to harm others? Would I still be in acting in my self-interest when I try to avoid doing things that make me feel guilty when it's all part of a system to minimise the potential harm that I cause? 


If you kill 1 to save 5 and there are no further negative ramifications, then all else being equal it maximises life and enjoyment for the most people.


But in most scenarios it is not possible to say that it will maximise life/enjoyment because you don’t know the circumstances of the people involved and cannot predict the future of their lives and the impact of the choice on society.


The 5 are already involved in the tragedy, and in some part may have accepted or contributed to their involvement in the situation. At the very least they are already involved. The vicissitudes of life have already befallen the 5. This can normally not be said of the 1.


The are potential follow-on ramifications of killing the 1 or treating it as morally acceptable, as it may encourage people to kill in other circumstances and divert people’s efforts away from beneficial activities in favour of securing or maintaining their personal safety. In a society, maximising the potential for happiness also means minimising people’s fear of each other. Which would be difficult to do if there was an appreciable risk that serious injury or loss would be inflicted upon individual non-participants in order to remedy someone else’s random calamity.


Changing the track in unclear circumstances can therefore be harmful to society as a whole. We don't want people to think that it's ok for them to choose who gets to suffer unless it is clear or consistent with accepted rules and norms. Society needs people to err on the side of caution and to discourage people from being comfortable engaging in violence.",g74wjlo,4.666666666666667
There should be a term defining the middle ground between sexual harassment and sexual assault.,"This is a view I really think I need to change so ...please help.

I woke up to what felt like kissing and found a guy in my bed. Though I definitely felt violated and scared I'm not quite comfortable calling it assault because that word is used to describe everything from groping to rape. I feel that when I use the word ""assault"" it automatically sets people up to think I was raped, when it was just an unwanted peck on the lips. 

Sexual harassment doesn't quite fit it either. For one, I wasn't conscious and didn't let him in my room or bed and sexual harassment usually encompasses crimes that happen when you are conscious.

I don't know what to call it, but I just wish there was a different term I could use that wasn't as heavy as ""sexual assault"" or as casual as ""sexual harassment""",l1q55l,"&gt; Though I definitely felt violated and scared I'm not quite comfortable calling it assault because that word is used to describe everything from groping to rape. 

Yeah, and how is what you described less invasive, than an unwanted groping? 

People already understand that assault covers a spectrum of violations, but what you described, is clearly *on the spectrum* somewhere, it's not beneath it. 

Calling it *rape*, would be an exaggeration. Rapre refers to many things, from violent gangrape at knifepoint, to one party being below the age of consent by a year, to feeling uncomfortable during sex, but not daring to say no. Still, if you applied the word to a peck on the lips, *that* would be stretching the word beyond it's useful definition. 

But that is exactly what the word sexual assault exist for, to cover the greater spectrum of sexual invasions like rape, unwanted groping, unwanted kissing, or ejaculating into someone's food, or such things, and your example is squarely fitting among those.",gk1mcnn,3.3333333333333335
"From someone who had to go to thrift stores throughout childhood, I can't see why my friends would think it would be so fun.","My friends recently decided that they wanted to go thrift shopping together once things become more relaxed. Just for some background we live in an mostly white upper-middle class area. I love my friends and all but they've **NEVER** set foot in a thrift store and when they described thrift shopping as looking ""so fun"" it just kinda annoyed me. As someone who has spent most of my childhood up until a couple years ago in hand me downs or thrifted clothes, barely being able to afford anything else, the thought that thrift shopping is ""so fun"" has never crossed my mind. (It didn't help that because I was so small, I'd get made fun of by certain people for wearing secondhand AND babyish clothes). Being able to afford to go to department stores is a real blessing, when you can't afford to shop at anywhere other than thrift stores it's kinda sad and something they've never dealt with. I used to hope that one day we could go to a real department store and get clothes that were new and mine, really *my own* and perfect. no stains, no holes, things I ***really*** liked... and in my size too!

So yeah to sum up I didn't used to live in such an affluent area and I'm very lucky. I just don't get why my friends think thrift shopping is such a big fun adventure when I could've only wished as a kid to go somewhere like Belk. Going to thrift stores when that's all you can afford is a less-than-golden situation that they've never had to experience. I don't wanna be annoyed but right now I am. Can y'all give some advice/perspective?

Thanks,

"Romantic subplots in writing are too risky, whereas all other relationships (family, friends, etc) can obtain the same effect while being the safer option.","I'm currently writing a long-running multi-genre story (slightly leaning towards urban sci-fi with horror undertones). 
       
As I develop my characters. I find myself thinking of several romantic relationships as a preference. However,from what I've read online:  
      
-The vibe I get when going online is people are tired of romance in general and I'd hate to scare away potential readers.    
        
-Romance apparently doesn't add to a plot. And if it did, the same effect can logically be obtained with all other relationships (siblings, close friend, comrade, mentor, etc.)         
             
-A reader is more likely to have a friend, co-worker, or sibling you care about, feelings are generally a given, so being able to relate isn't an issue. Romance is a different beast that people experience differently, what works for some is an eye-roll for others. Friends and family in comparison are more universally accepted.     
          
-Romance requires great skill to write, and many comments, both online and IRL, come from people who are tired of badly written romance. The same can be said for character plots and fight scenes, but both are a reason for why I write, so I'm already taking a risk in that sense.       
      
I keep coming to the conclusion that the negatives outweigh the positives on this aspect, so all my character relationships are either family, professional, or platonic.

Instead of writing a cliched and cringe-inducing romance where a cis man stalks a cis woman until she falls in love with him, you can write basically whatever kind of relationship you want without the “that’s not realistic” backlash.

Of course I also think it’s ridiculous that readers assume a completely fictional fantasy world with dragons and magic would have the same gender roles as medieval Europe, but that’s a topic for r/fantasy.

This is in response to another post, as I found that this was really the biggest issue with my view.  For those coming from that pose, hopefully this gives better context.

I have some close gay friends, so this is a concern for me as someone who has strong religious beliefs. I'm worried that if they were to ask me about my views and I told them, they would no longer want to be friends.  I think we should be able to be friends, but I get that it’s quite tricky since I’m basically admitting to thinking a major part of their lifestyle is wrong.

Christians (the real ones) don't hate people because they are trans or gay.  But I think the problem people have with Christians' view on this is that it is in a sense (or maybe completely) denying a trans person's chosen identity. I'm curious if it's possible for a Christian to hold the view that transgenderism is a sin without it upsetting or being problematic for trans people.

My main thought process through this is: what if my LGBTQ friend asked me what my view on it all was? What would my honest response be? And is there a way that we could still be friends afterward? This is my concern going in. I'm not trying to get rid of my LGBTQ friends, but I'm also not willing to lie about what I believe.

As a Christian, I don’t have a problem with being close friends with people within the LGBTQ community.  I don’t want to or plan to go around telling random people on the street my religious beliefs on the matter.  I think that’s unproductive and harmful because it’s not ever going to be seen as coming from a place of love or respect for them as a person.  Is that also going to have to be the case with my gay friends?

I know this is controversial, so I’m thanking those in advance who choose to try to understand my view and discuss it with me.

Donating basic organs wouldn’t have an affect during an open casket wake. The corpse would be sewn up and nobody would know they’re missing organs. As for skin, eyes, etc, that’s completely different and people should opt into that as well.

More specifically let me focus on temperature.

Temperature in celsius can be very useful when performing computation because the metric system is designed in part fpr this purpose. However, for purposes related to humans, fahrenheit is much better. 

For example let us talk about the weather. A majority of climates operate nicely within 0-100 degrees fahrenheit for humans and closely track with relative feel (0 is really cold, 100 is really hot, and 50 is relatively neutral or slightly chilled). Celcius does not have this property (-17.7 is really cold, 37.7 is really hot, 10 is neutral to slightly chilly). If you speak the language of metric you can still implicitly understand celcius, but almost anyone would understand a 0-100 scale for describing relative feel of temperature.

There are other (albeit weaker) examples of this that pop up as well such as feet/yards (strides) vs. meters, cups/ounces (how much liquid in a drinking glass) vs milliliters/liters. 

Perhaps the larger argument isnt about imperial vs metric but human relative vs measurement relative systems and how we might be able to intermix the two like we do with time. We do have a scientific concept of the second (and kilosecond if needed), but we also introduce relativistic measures like minutes, hours, days, and years that connect human intuition of seconds to concepts like Earth's rotation (day) and Solar cycles (seasons).",gd20aju,4.5
being a conservative is the least Christ-like political view,"From what I know, Christ was essentially a radical leftist. He was all about helping and loving the poor, hungry, disabled, outcast. He would feed 10 people just in case one was going hungry. He flipped a table when banks were trying to take advantage of people. He was anti-capitalist and pro social responsibility to support, love and respect all members of society. He was, based on location and era, probably a person of color. He would not stand for discrimination. He would overthrow an institution that treated people like crap.

On the other hand, conservatives are all about greed. They are not willing to help people in need (through governmental means) because they “didn’t earn it” and it’s “my tax dollars”. They are very pro-capitalism, and would let 10 people go hungry because one might not actually need the help. They do not believe in social responsibility, instead they prioritize the individual. Very dog eat dog world to them. And, while there are conservatives of color, in America most conservatives are at least a little bit racist (intentionally or not) because most do not recognize how racism can be institutional and generational. They think everyone has the same opportunities and you can just magically work your way out of poverty. 

Christ would be a radical leftist and conservatism is about as far as you can get from being Christ-like in politics. The Bible says nothing about abortion (it actually basically only says if someone makes a pregnant woman lose her baby, they have to pay the husband). It does not say homosexuality is sin, just that a man should not lie with a boy (basically, anti pedophilia) based on new translations not run through the filter of King James. Other arguments are based on Old Testament, which is not what Christianity focuses on. Jesus said forget that, listen to me (enter Christianity). Essentially all conservative arguments using the Bible are shaky at best. And if you just look at the overall message of Jesus, he would disagree with conservatives on almost everything.

EDIT: Wow, this is blowing up. I tried to respond to a lot of people. I tried to keep my post open (saying left instead of Democrat, saying Christian instead of Baptist or Protestant) to encourage more discussion on the differences between subgroups. It was not my intent to lump groups together.

Of course I am not the #1 most educated person in the world on these issues. I posted my opinion, which as a human, is of course flawed and even sometimes uninformed. I appreciate everyone who commented kindly, even if it was in disagreement.

I think this is a really interesting discussion and I genuinely enjoy hearing all the points of view. I’m trying to be more open minded about how conservative Christians can have the views they have, as from my irreligious upbringing, it seemed contradictory. I’ve learned a lot today!

I still think some conservatives do not live or operate in a Christ-like manner and yet thump the Bible to make political points, which is frustrating and the original inspiration for this point. However I now understand that that is not ALWAYS the case.",kvwbxj,"Man, talk about stereotyping. You’re just going to lump everyone into one definition here?

(America) The Native American Federation should have seats in the US House of Representatives and in the Senate,"The indigenous peoples in America may be recognized as autonomous tribes, but their governance is distinct from the states in which they reside. 

State law does not apply to reservations, only tribal law and federal law, which does include federal taxes. They are, in essence, their own states, yet are affected by federal policy and governance and deserve a voice in matters of governing policy. 

The first peoples population is about 2.7 million, with 55.7 million acres in land. By contrast, Rhode Island has a population of 1 million and .77 million acres but is afforded representation. 

A division of the Department of the Interior, The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which presently manages tribal oversight, is toothless and an abject failure in its goals to protect those it oversees. Reference: https://www.change.org/p/federal-indian-policy-is-a-failure-for-indian-country There have been no penalties for the feds in steamrolling our under-represented American siblings historically or presently, probably, because politically no one with power has skin in the game. 

It is right, it is lawful, and in-line with our founding policy that ALL people should have a say regarding the laws to which they are beholden. We, as a nation, are strong because we empower one another and can act cohisively even, if views are at odds. These peoples are not owed this because of their tragic history, it is not a matter of reparations, it is a birthright of all Americans to have a vote and representation in the halls of power, someone at the other end of a phone who casts votes and makes laws in THEIR name, and right now, those accountable who are for the future are not put in place through the process outlined by our constitution.

EDIT: Seen the demographic counter a couple times so I want to be clear: I am not proposing representation by demographic or race but instead by area of residency. If someone lives on Tribal land, outside of state (but under federal) law, those people deserve representation

Edit 2: This was a lot more fun than I thought it would be, but have run out of dedicated time to focus here. This sub should be proud of its population :) I've heard several great points that have given me a little more nuance to my view even if my stance remains unchanged.

The issue I see is that you have many distinct tribes, and many people in different geographial locations who you presume all want the same representatives based on the mere fact that they are Native American/ reside in Native American land. 

This means that they have to now all agree on the same people, who are then supposed to somehow equally represent people living in vastly different locations. 

And, because they give up the right to vote in the states they reside in, some people will now feel less represented in anything that is not dierectly related to Native American issues. Where they might have felt individually better represented by a candidate from their state.",icqwds9,2.8
"If workers are always working extra hours, the company needs more employees","A friend of mine is working for a company for a couple of months now.

I don't think that this is OK as there are lots of consequences in the foreseeable future: burnout, decrease in performance, mental health, etc. The way I see it, the company needs to hire new employees as that would distribute the hours needed for each project into more people working regular hours.

Cashiers should never be forced to stand if not necessary for their job,"Cashiers are rarely allowed to sit in grocery stores, and other retail jobs. Sitting might sometimes affect the ability to perform certain tasks, but cashiers can stand for these, if needed. But in my experience, most cashier duties involve scanning, hitting buttons, and putting things in bags. All of these can be performed while sitting.   

I believe there are work-culture reasons for requiring cashiers to stand that are not based on their ability to perform their job, but based on the ""perception"" of being less alert, or at worst, lazy.  

I do not think most customers care about these perceptions as much as managers and corporate leaders think they do. 

Not all cashiers will care about this, but there are enough cashiers that would greatly benefit from being allowed to sit for health reasons, and for morale reasons.

It is reasonable to segregate athletes by sex rather than gender,"There is something I do not understand about the debate about transgender people in sports. 

I believe that most transgender people and allies agree that _sex_ and _gender_ are distinct things. 

As I understand it, _sex_ refers to biological differences related to reproduction (e.g. pregnancy, lactation) and other physiological differences linked to it (e.g. size), whereas _gender_ refers to a set of social norms and expectations that are _associated with sex but not inextricably tied to it_.

By default, cisgender people identify as the gender that ""matches"" their sex, whereas most transgender people identify as the gender that ""mismatches"" their sex. 

I seem to recall having heard one trans person say that the terms _male/female_ should be used to refer to _sex_ and that the terms _man/woman_ should be used to refer to _gender_. I don't know how widely accepted this terminological distinction is. 

A number of transgender people want to compete in sports alongside athletes of the same gender. 

But it seems to me that the segregation of athletes has little to do with social norms and everything to do with physiology. In other words, athletes are segregated not by _gender_ but by _sex_.

Most transwomen are women by gender but male by sex. If we view the segregation of athletes as one of sex, it ought to be reasonable that transwomen compete alongside cis men.

(Transmen who have transitioned medically may present a special problem. I do not know of any good solution to that.)

It is possible that I misunderstand something regarding what sex and gender is supposed to be. If you think so, CMV.",uid5xp,"Personally, I see this as more of an issue at the school level.

Canceling/subsidizing any amount of student loan debt shouldn't be considered until a legislation is put out to minimize the reasons debt is skyrocketing in the first place.,"In light of the U.S. considering canceling student loan debt with President Biden pushing $10k and Democrats pushing $50k, the focus seems to be the value rather than how to stop the next generation from digging that hole. Background, joined military, got school payed for etc. I'm borderline okay with my taxes going out so others won't have to be as worried with that crippling debt due to their choices. I'd be much more okay with the previous statement if I knew I had to never do it again cause there's laws in place.

The leadership of the US republican party is no longer interested in maintaining a fully democratic system.,"I'll start with a disclaimer: this post will reference some things Trump did, but it's not about Trump directly. Rather it's about the current leadership of the republican party, which I'll simply refer to as the GOP.

My thesis is this: the GOP has known for some several decades that it's voter base is shrinking. It's response has increasingly been to target the systems and institutions underpinning democracy. During the Trump presidency at the latest the GOP has decided to take the next step and interfere in the elections directly to stay in power.

The GOP has known for some decades that demographic trends do not favor it's traditional base. Faced with that, there have been repeated debates about whether it's appeal needs to broaden. However, time and again the decision was made to focus on the already highly mobilised core voters rather than try to open up. The tea party movement has given the latest big push in that direction.

At the same time, political taboos have started falling, and it has been the GOP leading the push in most cases. REDMAP was a coordinated effort at gerrymandering. Citizens United was a conservative platform. Under Mitch McConnell, the US senate has become a graveyard of bills. A supreme court nomination was held up for months for Partisan reasons.

Now, a president is in office, backed by the GOP, who openly calls the election into question, has instated a personal friend with no obvious qualifications at the head of the postal service and is suggesting his supporters try voter fraud to see if the system is really safe. A president who is already on record soliciting foreign aid in his re-election By their continued support, the GOP is all but openly admitting that they do not care about the integrity of the election.

Now I am not suggesting the GOP will set up Trump as a dictator on November 4th. But neither will they accept the result of the election. They will do what they think they can get away with, until they have a grip on power that's no longer dependant on actual votes. I don't know whether they already know what their preferred end result looks like. But it does seem to me that genuine respect for democracy no longer features in it.",it82ms,"We aren't a democracy we are a republic. Be honest if Trump loses do you think there will be riots?

The U.S. should abolish the two party system,"The United State's two party system used to be applauded for its winner-take-all approach. One party wouldn't be elected if they ignored the needs and wants of the other party, so it seemed like a system that would force politicians to think about the country as a whole. And yet, the polarization between political parties has made it difficult to meet the needs and wants of everyone. Regardless of your political opinion, it is obvious that tensions are high and EVERY SINGLE issue is turned into a political one. The most basic humanitarian ideals are being politicized all because of the two-party system. While abolishing them wouldn't fix anything (because politics are always going to suck in some fashion) it would lessen the need to align wholeheartedly with one party and platform. During elections, political candidates would advocate for POLICY rather than PARTY. The United States government never should have adopted a party system in the first place.

it is reasonable to racially profile young black males for your own safety,"The story today about an 18 year old college student who was stabbed to death by young teenage black kids in a park was heart breaking. By some accounts (social media posts) the victim was extremely ""woke"" and would probably view racial profiling as extremely wrong.

[https://time.com/5750299/tessa-majors-stabbing-barnard/](https://time.com/5750299/tessa-majors-stabbing-barnard/)

Although I can understand the systemic harms of racial profiling by government actors like the police, I feel that using racial profiling for your own safety in certain circumstances is morally justified, and in fact should be encouraged by parents to try to safeguard the well being of their children. Statistically, young black males in the US are much more likely to commit violent crimes than other demographics.  Anecdotally, many of my friends in college and grad school have been victimized (muggings) by young black males, compared to none for any other racial group.

I don't think it's fair to group people together by racial characteristics, and I sympathize with black kids who feel that people look at them as potential criminals or cross the street when coming across them, but I can't imagine getting a phone call in the middle of the night telling me that my 18 year old daughter was just stabbed to death by some 13 year old boys in the park and thinking to myself that I never warned her about the realities of criminal behavior and race because of PC culture.",ebk62u,Is it reasonable for women to profile men for their own safety?,fb85qya,1.25
English courses have become flawed in representation of issues and depth of study," 

In my experience, all English classes I have taken within 'Higher Level' schooling (this is Middle and High school Honors, as well as College level courses, I am not including standard courses as I don't have any experience with them) cover the same topics. The Holocaust, Male roles need to change, Minorities are discriminated against. All of these topics are extremely important, I'm not discounting this in any way, but how they are covered (and what is missed by singularly covering these) is what becomes vital to address. TLDR at the bottom if you don't want to read this long of a post.

**Lying for a grade**

In English courses, students hardly need to do any work to complete an assignment. Oh, you're reading a Greek tragedy? ""This text demonstrates the impermanence of life, and the grip on reality of the individual"". Great work! Gold star for you, and you didn't even read the book. Maybe this year your teacher tried something truly original, maybe we will cover the Holocaust... perhaps the perspective of someone within it? (Again I can't stress enough, these are important issues and serious topics, but the way they are presented is flawed). The only questions asked are ""who is to blame"" and ""how does this make you feel"". There is no deeper thinking or meaning to the assignment, it's a time-waster designed to say ""we teach your children about positive topics and make them sensitive to different experiences"" when half the students don't even read the text, and can't tell proper grammar if it was right in front of them.

**Repetitive topics**

As I said, these topics are covered year after year, whether it is the perspective of a victim of the holocaust, a minority that grew up in poverty, a newly outed individual, or whatever a teacher throws at you, it comes back every time. In my experience, all I see happening from this is people expressing the same opinions and views year after year, with me commonly being in the same classes as the same 90-120 or so kids through high school, it is especially apparent. Every year, I see the same ""It is clear to me that the society these people lived in pushed them down, but despite this discrimination, they still got back up again."" Or when discrimination isn't covered and we go back to genocide, I see the classic ""the (people in power) were so disillusioned from reality that they didn't see the role of these people they persecuted and killed, and this resulted in so-and-so social change."" There is no real furthering of the individual by not making them think deeper than ""why is this bad"". There are no meaningful questions asked about any of these topics, even in advanced, higher-level courses. Not a single day in all of my experience with English courses have I ever walked out thinking that I thought differently that day, that I saw a new perspective and could consider myself a better person for it.

**Lack of basic skills**

This is going to overlap with some other opinions I've seen numerous times on reddit aa a whole, so I apologize in advance, but it is still a valuable portion of the larger point I'm making. HOW DO PEOPLE NOT KNOW EVEN BASIC SPELLING AND GRAMMAR? ""Hi they're"" should never be acceptable, and the fact that spelling and grammar have begun taking a backseat to spouting off generic ""genocide bad"" opinions in English papers disgusts me. When I was made to peer review papers for English classes I saw more spelling mistakes than papers in my U.S. History course. At the very least, teach more than sentence structure in seventh grade, it's clear that attempting to teach cursive in elementary school wasn't the pressing issue in the children. Priorities in younger education shouldn't be learning to comprehend harder books until the kids can understand at least basic grammar and spelling with average or better skills.

**Disproportionate representation**

This point may be more applicable to my own life than others, but I feel like it can still be made and understood by looking through my eyes, or considering different teaching in different areas. In English courses, discrimination, bigotry, and the like are consistently portrayed as the most pressing issue in the world, that it will destroy us all like some boogeyman in the shadows. Books describing a minority family or individual living in poverty or growing through hardships always has the same questions covering it: ""how do you see discrimination in your own life"", ""how do you help people through hardship"" and other surface-level, generalizing questions. These lessons and questions, combined with the media always covering some sort of racially or religiously motivated crime made me think that I must have lived in some veritable haven compared with the rest of the world. Only once I started learning more about what we covered and the world as a whole (between 6th and 7th grade or so) did I learn that courses presented these topics in a disproportionate capacity to how they appear in the world. While racism, sexism, Islamophobia, and the like are certainly present, and major issues with our world, they aren't as widespread as these courses portray them. By only covering discrimination, genocide, and the views from within them, these courses never show us the positive, and the beneficial in society. I acknowledge that reading a book about some generic individual helping people cross the street wouldn't make good lessons, so I think a valuable way educators could still cover these topics in the same capacity, while making students learn and think differently would be to vary the questions they use, go deeper than surface level, ask for motivations of the antagonist, how you can understand all the views in the story, and make students think more about the text as a whole. In addition to that, students can be asked to talk about the good that they see in the world, or every so often complete a one- or two-day assignment finding and presenting a positive story in the world. It would help to make people understand good exists alongside bad, and knowing how slow the English curriculum progresses, the time can be spared. One very difficult and *extremely* sensitive way to perform this would be to attempt to present the views of the antagonist. Show students a story from the perspective of the perpetrator of these acts. This may very well be impossible, I've never seen a single even slightly rational or coherent perspective or idea given by a racist or sexist individual, or anything like that, yet it would be a way to change the way these topics are portrayed, to give students a way to think about these topics from a different perspective and understand on more levels than just ""My family was killed in this genocide"" or ""I can't get a job because of my race/religion/etc"".

**Wrap-up**

Again, I cannot stress enough how sensitive and important these topics are. I think students that understand the impact of these events and ways of thought are vital to our society. I simply believe that the way they have been taught, in my experience, is negative and isn't as beneficial as it could be, or in the worst case, could be negative for the students. The loss of grammatical skills, the surface-level readings of these topics, the ability to be the same year after year with no work is severely detrimental to education and the ability of someone to be well-rounded in today's world.

I'm interested in hearing if any of you have any justification for these classes changing this way, other ideas for changes, or reasons any change to the curriculum isn't feasible (other than the classic 'it's just how things are' excuse, of course), or anything else you'd like to bring to the table!

TLDR: English classes have begun portraying serious topics in a very generalized, surface-level way, leaving out vital grammatical skills, and disproportionately showing the world as a whole.",gajf7q,"&gt;Oh, you're reading a Greek tragedy? ""This text demonstrates the impermanence of life, and the grip on reality of the individual"". Great work! Gold star for you, and you didn't even read the book...

Where did you go to college? I have never been in an English class where an argument that trite would get a good grade, or where the question “how does this make you feel” is the only one asked. Most English teachers I know would seriously penalize an essay that substitutes personal feelings or value judgments about “blame” for actual textual analysis. 

It seems like you have a grievance against what you think are too many minorities and social-justice topics in the curriculum, but I’m not sure you’ve articulated why this is bad. What would be the advantage of moving to a less diverse curriculum?

Grammar is another question; English classes in higher education are about teaching close reading and critical thinking, not grammar, which is a subject for a much earlier stage in education.",fp04uj4,2.75
Neo gender identities such as non-binary and genderfluid are contrived and do not hold any coherent meaning.,"EDIT 3: Yeah this has pretty much run its course now and I'm going to leave it here. I just wanted to do this last note at the top to summarise my thoughts at this point:

 - Some people, like me in the opening post, define gender or gender identity as inherently of the relation between your physical sex and perception of self. One thing I've gained from comments here is that what I might class as dysphoria isn't as simple as I had thought and some people have explained identifying as non-binary or something other than male/female in degrees of dysphoria or different types of it which I hadn't considered or been aware of, so that's helped my understanding of those terms from that angle.
 - Other people define and relate to gender strictly in terms of culture, social expectations and their relation to the world around them. They identify in non-binary terms because of how they deviate from or feel those norms don't apply to them. I'm still a little ""jury out"" in my mind on whether I would personally class that as a gender identity, but it's certainly been insightful in how these terms can be valid simply insofar as not everyone means the same thing when they talk about gender.
 - Another thing that came from the above was numerous contributors made reference to other cultures which include genders besides male and female in some form. To be honest, without being an expert on each and every one of those cultures, I can't really say to what extent that's relevant in the application of gender and gender identity in modern Western culture and society. I certainly take the point that it underscores how conceptions of gender can vary depending on when and where you are, but that there may be other cultures which recognise three, four or a million genders isn't really a point of contention to me or what I was asking people to ""change my view"" on, because I was specifically asking about how people use those terms here and today...I mean, unless you're saying what you mean when you identify as non-binary is the same thing the Navajo tribe mean by two-spirit so I should read up on that, I'm just not sure it really tells me much.
 - Yes, I still believe there are ""snowflakes"" in the world, people for whom these labels are nothing more than a teenage fad, or a way of claiming victimhood. But I have also learned that assuming anyone using terms like non-binary, genderfluid, femme etc. falls in to this attention-seeking category is indeed a deep misconception on my part. I was actually surprised at how little resentment, anger, offence or reactionary calling me a Nazi took place for asking these questions in what I expected to be an extremely touchy subject (I mean, it did happen, but it was very few people), but it is one I wanted to explore and understand better. The overwhelming majority of you were very friendly, sincere and I got a lot of positive understanding and human engagement out of it. Very grateful to you for that.
 - My biggest outstanding question or thought on this is I still wonder to what extent the ever growing vocabulary around not just gender but broader identity is actually helpful as sociopolitical discourse. I guess I think when you develop these increasingly specialised and numerous terms for identity characteristics, whether intentional or not you run the risk of further dividing and segregating people, boxing in their personalities to arbitrary labels and even pitting them against each in competition for recognition and resources. And yet that seems like the opposite of what you would want to happen. So yeah, well I wouldn't blanket dismiss identity politics and advocacy based around identity as universally a bad thing, I think it comes with a lot of caveats and is something you should do with caution.

Thanks to all who took part.

---
Gender identity in the mainstream, until a few years ago, was defined exclusively in terms of male and female (the gender binary). We also obviously had awareness of transgender people, who experience body dysphoria, an innate sense they were born as the wrong sex and in many cases, take steps to live and present as the sex they believe they should be. There are also a very small proportion of people who are clinically intersex, which depending on what form and to what degree may or may not impact whether they can be distinctly classified as male or female.

None of the above is a controversial ""change my view"" thing for me; the existence of trans people and intersex people is self evident, as is that they do not necessarily fit the distinctly male or female gender identity in which the vast majority of people fall.

More recently, however, we have seen the widespread adoption in mainstream discourse of ideas like ""non-binary"", ""genderfluid"", ""gender is a spectrum"" etc., or even that you don't need dysphoria to be trans (this last one is especially bizarre to me, as I would say being transgender by definition requires you to experience body dysphoria).

That I do not get. To me it seems like contrived attention seeking. Either it does not really mean anything coherent, or when people who espouse these views are referring to gender and gender identity, they mean something totally different by those terms than I do.

For example, if I were to say my gender identity is male, what I mean by that is the combination of the following two things:

1. I am physically, biologically male and have the corresponding physical traits to that sex.

2. There is no disconnect between my body and sense of self; no part of my body or its maleness feels ""wrong"" or like it doesn't belong to me as a self aware being.

A trans person would say there is a disconnect between their bodily traits and sense of self.

What's a ""non-binary"" person who is not intersex and distinctly, physically classifiable as either male or female expressing when they say they do not feel male or female? ""Gender"" to me in that context is the relation of your physical sex to your identity, so I don't see how it's possible to have something ""in between"".

The only answers I have ever seen make reference to tastes, personal preferences, things I would regard as personality rather than gender. I for example reject that not being a walking one dimensional 1950s stereotype of your sex somehow amounts to holding a different gender identity, nor do I see how that is even coherent as a concept. You're a young boy who likes baking cupcakes and playing with Barbie dolls? That makes you a boy who likes baking cupcakes and playing with Barbie dolls, that's all. You're a teenage girl who likes cutting your hair short, putting on a hoodie and skateboarding? Great. What's that got to do with anything we'd refer to as your gender?

So that's my ""change my view"" - explain to me what it means to say your gender identity is fluid, non binary or whatever other neologism has been coined for it and how this is not just either a conflation of gender with personality, or a bandwagon to claim a marginalised identity by people who are entirely ordinary.

EDIT: Huge thank you to everyone who's contributed, it's getting to a point now I can't keep up with or respond to all the answers. I'll keep reading what comes in, but I'm going to have to largely drop out of replying at this point, perhaps save the odd thing which particularly piques my interest.

EDIT 2: Again, thank you everyone. Some of the answers in this thread have been qualitative, useful and given me a better and wider understanding of these gender identities and gender issues. It's very clear that many people have many different conceptions and views of what gender is, how it relates to ourselves as individuals and the constituency of culture and society. While I do still believe there are people out there who co-opt certain labels and identities essentially as a form of attention seeking without any substance to it, it is also clear that to many other people these identities have real, significant meanings which speak to them in a way binary gender doesn't and which have been insightfully explained. To that extent, this post has been successful in ""changing my view"" and giving me a better understanding of other people's perceptions and experiences.

I want to finish by addressing one last point; there have been a few accusations that the title and body of my post was rude, insulting or disrespectful. I won't apologise for incidentally offending anyone when that wasn't my intention, but I will tell you that wasn't my intention. I do my best day to day in my life to be empathetic, to understand people, to learn, to grow, to challenge myself, my own judgements and perceptions by actively seeking out those of others which may be different and to reserve the right to unapologetically change my mind at any time new information or perspective convinces me I was wrong. That's what I was trying to do here. There's no point approaching that by holding back or being dishonest about what I'm thinking when I come in.",erfdcf,"Something too to think about, the Transgender flag was created in 1999.

"""do us a favor"" is an offer of quid pro quo.","Yes, I realize there is no explicit amount of quid pro quo expressed by a request couched as a favor. But asking it as a favor inherently implies that there will be a return favor (of unclear magnitude).

Voting for a candidate based on electability is a repudiation of democracy.,"Note: I'm a Democrat but welcome the advice of anyone across the political spectrum who can relate to this dilemma.

At this point in 2020, the presidential race has left me hopeless. All the candidates that appealed to me have dropped out and I'm left with two options: ""bet on the winning horse"" or vote third-party. While not ideal, some of the current third-party candidates appeal to me and I can sleep well at night knowing that I voted my conscience if I pick them. Here's why:

* **I live in California**

My home state of California has the largest population (and congressional districts) of any state in the Union. Statistically, my vote will matter less than that of a citizen anywhere else in the United States. Even if my vote is part of the majority needed to win my congressional district, it's 1 out of 53.

* **Biden has a Solid Lead**

Although Trump is [leading in battleground states](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/13/politics/cnn-poll-2020/index.html), 51% of voters nationwide have pledged to vote for Biden. More importantly, if Trump wins every battleground state, he would only gain a total of 196 electoral votes from these instead of the requisite 270. That's a bigger margin for Trump to overcome than the one he had over Clinton in 2016.

* **Democracy Represents Voters, Not the ""Winning Horse""**

What, on an ideological level, is the point of American democracy? If it's to make the most popular candidate, by head count, win the presidential race, that raises some questions. The popular vote doesn't matter for the presidency, as it's decided by the electoral college. The purpose, then, must be to assess which candidates citizens support without allowing majority rule to dictate the direction of America's presidential elections. If I don't vote for the candidate I support, rather than the likeliest winner, I have essentially thrown away the utility of democracy as a formal institution.

I will change my view if you can prove one of the following:

1. Electability matters more than stances on the issues
2. My vote has significant influence in the presidential election
3. I have a flawed understanding of the purpose of American democracy",gk25bs,"Guess I'll take a swing at your #1 (electability vs positions) by noting that if you care about policy outcomes, *acceptable* policy positions must be paired with an electable candidate. Note the 'must' - electability is an absolute requirement, whereas policy positions are numerous and finely-variable.

If what you want to do is 'signal' with your vote, accurately registering your true preferences in your candidate is key. But if you want policy outcomes - and especially, if you most want to *avoid* policy outcomes diametrically opposite your preferences - then electability is *much* more important than policy fidelity, until the policies in question are so far from your preferences as to be just as bad as the opposition party.

The first past the post, two party context is obviously a big factor here - in other environments (i.e. Europe) voting your true preferences makes a lot more sense.",fqqq02n,3.25
English and North American countries should teach sign language as a compulsory second language.,"European and North American countries should stop compulsory teaching of a second spoken language in schools\*, and should instead teach **one** **common****^(3)** sign language (maybe ASL, but an alternative would be a language designed from the bottom up to be easy to learn).    Advantages would be:

\- It would get used regularly by everyone in situations where spoken languages caused problems (crowded bar, across a crowd, in a library, talking to grandad when he's forgotten his hearing aid, foreign travel, communicating with people who are completely deaf\*\*).

\- As a result enough people would be good enough at it that it COULD be used for international communication.

\- If the above countries started it, almost certainly other countries (at least those with significant trade or tourism links with them) would follow - it would be a lot easier to learn than the current option!

\- Europe rather needs a new lingua Franca (and yes, I do love the irony that it almost certainly won't be French!) unless it wants to give the UK the satisfaction of continuing to use English (although there are of course benefits to the current generation of diplomats of continuing with the status quo)

Disadvantages would be:

\- Foreign language teachers needing to retrain.

\- Possibly slower verbal development in kids if their parents don't prioritize verbal communication even when sign language is more efficient.

\- Less demand for the skills of those who can already speak foreign languages (although I'm not sure this would actually be a big issue given older generations would likely be slower to pick up the new language).

&amp;#x200B;

\*I'm not saying don't teach other foreign languages at all and there might be exceptions where you'd want to make one compulsory (I imagine teaching Spanish to Californians would make sense, for instance) but it makes sense to me to let (eg) UK kids take French as an option the way they would German or Spanish.

\*\*I realize that this might seem to be belittling the impact on the deaf community.  I don't mean to do that, and in fact, I'd hope that they'd get a lot of benefits.  However, in terms of a policy that you might get not only governments but also their citizens behind, I'm inclined to appeal to the self-interest of the average voter, who doesn't specifically want to talk to deaf people but does want to be able to chat to their mates in a noisy bar while holding (and possibly even drinking) a pint.

The points system of attendance is counter-productive to a company and contributes to Waste and Abuse by increasing turnover rate.,"I know that when a company gets big enough it needs to standardize the attendance system. Its no longer ""Boss, I can't work today I feel sick"" because Boss won't be able to pick up the phone while doing other work. 

But the points system is severely restrictive. There's a lot of that can happen to an employee that may prevent them from going to work yet they are held accountable in a points system that is non-negotiable. This is especially true when you work from home and you got no internet connection, for example. 

The thing is companies like to make the points system as abusive as possible by making you, say, wait an entire year to earn back your point and you are only allowed up to 7 points, for example, before you are fired. 

That's only a week you can afford to be off. It almost makes it seem like these companies *want* their employees to be fired due to attendance. Why can't they just hold an employee accountable at work for meeting a percentage of their attendance (93% for example) a month instead of a rigid points system? 

And I know there are leave types available depending on the company (Paid Parental Leave, Personal Leave, Family Leave, etc.) but that varies between each company and sometimes and employee may not be eligible for various reasons, such as length of employment, part-time status, etc. 

Even supervisors and Managers get fired over this. Unbelievable. Why does a company insist on this damnable points system if they're just gonna lose a lot of employees over time?",kf2jd7,"Rehiring and retraining employees costs money.

Biological traits unique to men are entirely caused by men's reproductive expendability. Patriarchal society is a side effect.,"Here's my theory: As a primitive society, your reproductive engine is entirely bottlenecked by the number of women you have. 

50 men + 50 young women == 50 babies

1 man + 50 young women == 50 babies (and one very happy guy)

More is better, of course (genetic diversity, men can be helpful, etc), but I would say the driving force causing sexual dimorphism is *the ways men can be helpful by taking the lion's share of collective risk*.

Men are biologically warriors because their deaths are less impactful on the tribe, so it's their primitive role to carry out risk and violence.

* Beards for padding punches
* Extra tall, longer limbs (no need to be lower to the ground for the anatomical changes of pregnancy, better to be faster and have longer reach)
* Testosterone motivated behavioral changes such as
   * Risk taking behavior
   * Aggression
* More lean muscle development
* Faster metabolisms (moving, carrying, fighting, whereas women serve the tribe better by staying still/safe and consuming less calories)

I can't really think of any male-specific traits that can't be connected to expendability 

Women are the natural intellectual leaders the way human's have evolved and that's why many early tribal societies were matriarchal. It doesn't make sense, strategically, to have critical leadership roles filled by men when they're more likely to die.

Patriarchy seems, then,  like a byproduct of the agricultural revolution, when territory control allowed for crop yield, power projection, dominion, and wars/consolidation of violence became relevant, and men's roles became more significant in the welfare of a people.

Free will is an illusion.,"This is a view I've held for many years - so it's high time I find some reasons to seriously challenge it. I'll try my best to explain my position and then you can try to poke holes in it. This is my first CMV post, so apologies in advance if I make any mistakes in regards to the rules.

1. The concept of ""choice"" doesn't hold water under scrutiny. There are only two reasons we take a particular course of action - because it's instinctual, or because we want to. In the case of instinct, consider the reflex that occurs from placing your hand on a hot stove. This category covers involuntary actions that are programmed into us on a biological level.
In regards to ""wants,"" I choose one flavor of ice cream over another because of my preferences and personality. Or, if someone holds a gun to my head and forces me to hand over my wallet, my desire to live outweighs my desire to keep my wallet, so I hand it over. This ""choice,"" no matter how consciously aware of it we are, ultimately stems from the particular way in which our brain is wired. But we don't have control over this either. From the moment of birth onward, our life experiences shape our personality into what it is. If I had been born to different parents in a different country, etc. I would grow up to be a very different person. Our personality evolves in response to circumstances over which we have no control. There are also biological factors to consider in regards to how one's brain is configured, but of course we don't control our genetic heritage either. So what room is left for me to make a ""decision"" that's not bound by these factors?

2. Arguments against free will often invoke ""cause and effect,"" but the savvy among you will no doubt point out that quantum physics demonstrates that the universe may be fundamentally unpredictable or random at a certain level. Regardless, I don't think this affects the previous point. Either we're cogs in a clockwork cosmos, or we're subject to the unpredictable randomness of quantum fluctuations. Where is the room for agency here?

3. Being consciously aware of our actions doesn't mean we have true agency over them. The human brain stitches together a narrative of our experience from various sensory inputs, but it also makes ""assumptions"" about what we perceive, so there is a great deal of potential for deception. Consider the illusion of seeing faces where there aren't any - even the front grill and headlights of a car can seem to take on anthropomorphic qualities because of our instinctual bias to seek out face-like patterns. Or as a second example: ""It deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae."" We can comprehend the previous sentence because of the way the brain makes predictions while reading. There is clearly a lot of mental processing happening ""behind the scenes"" that we aren't even consciously aware of, let alone in control of. I won't argue against the observation that it certainly *feels* like we are in control of our decisions, but that isn't sufficient proof that we are, because the brain can play tricks we aren't even aware of.

4. The existence of reason/rationality doesn't prove the existence of free choice either. So if someone manages to change my mind about this subject, for example, I will have had no choice in the matter. (Paradox?) Hopefully my brain is wired in such a way that my capacity for logic will allow me to correctly analyze your response, and I will either reject it or accept it. Or my personal biases will cloud my judgement, but I consider myself to be fairly reasonable. Either way, I can't ""choose"" to suddenly believe in free will (I would be lying to myself) and I also can't ""choose"" to be unconvinced by a sufficiently convincing argument (unless I'm dishonest or overly biased.)

5. Morality and the existence of a justice system don't prove free will either. Even if the non-existence of free will proves that no one should be held accountable for their actions, that doesn't have any bearing on whether or not it's actually true. However I would argue that doesn't necessarily need to be the case. A legal justice system is still useful because of deterrence, for example. It also provides a way to remove people from society that are just too dangerous to have around - serial killers, etc. However, if we were to take into account the ways in which upbringing, circumstance, and the lens through which people perceive the world ultimately dictate their actions, then it may actually suggest useful reforms for the current justice system. For example, why is someone caught with possession of heroin thrown in jail? They haven't hurt anyone besides themselves, and addiction is a medical illness they don't have control over. Better to send them to rehab, or at the very least to minimize the damage caused by heroin with clean needle clinics, etc. I think our justice should focus less on ""punishment,"" which primarily serves to satisfy the (arguably base) desires of the prosecutors or victims, and focus more on reform and rehabilitation. Better to train people to become functioning members of society if at all possible, as well as work toward reducing poverty and other environmental factors that lead to increased crime rates. If the current justice system is so effective, why are there so many repeat offenders? Anyway, I'm getting off-topic, and I'm by far no legal expert, but I wanted to add this point because it often comes up in debates about free will.

Change my view, reddit. I have no choice but to accept and reward with deltas any sufficiently convincing arguments (or do I?)",c1rvdy,"Query : When you say free will is an illusion, do you mean ""free will is in our head"" and/or ""free will doesn't exist""?",erf55i4,2.0

Craft beer is becoming far too expensive,"In the past few years, the price of craft beer in the USA has been becoming absurd. I’ll use the Northeast as an example as I’m living here and most familiar with it. In Boston, you can routinely now go into any liquor store and find a host of 4-packs for $15 or more. This breaks down to roughly $7.50/L; and that’s becoming the norm. Some beers in 750mL format are selling for more like $20/L. Meanwhile, a few shelves down, you can find Narragansett for roughly $2.10/L. Most of you would rather drink Boom Sauce than Gansett, I know (so would I) but why is the price so different?

The most obvious thought is that it’s ingredients: 

Beer is not like wine. With some very rare exceptions, the ingredients used to make beer are not especially tied to region. You very rarely if ever see their provenance advertised or even mentioned (with the hilarious exception of Coors Light’s water). Unlike wine, almost no beer has ‘terroir’. There is not some tiny stirp of barely on the side of a hill in France with the perfect sunlight, minerally soil, and warm evening wind off the Mediterranean that makes one beer more special than another.  

Yes, some craft beers have special ingredients. Those can break down into specialty grains, hops, and other additives (which are mostly insignificant in terms of cost). The grains are almost all still barely, just malted or toasted differently. Non barely grains are not really more expensive than barely and are used sparingly. Some specialty hops do cost more but hops prices have been coming way down from their heights and are now quite affordable – and gratuitous hop usage is just wasteful anyway. 

Is craft beer more expensive because ingredients? To *some* degree, yes. Does it justify the massive difference in price you see on store shelves? No. Let’s break it down:

Craft beer tends to be higher in ABV. OK, so that’s a bit more grain and some slightly different procedures. Hardly breaking the bank. Craft beer tends to be more bitter and uses more expensive hop varieties. OK but those hops are really not all that expensive when you look at a share of the sticker price. Estimates are about 4% of the cost of craft beer is the hops. 

Yeast deserves a mention. While yeast can be a significant cost for the homebrewer, the craft brewer almost certainly cultures their own yeast, meaning it costs basically nothing by comparison. 

So if it’s not the ingredients (and it’s not), then is it the difficulty in ‘crafting’ craft beer? Again, no. Those $20/L beers very rarely require different equipment, much more labor, or especially modified protocols compared to cheaper beer. There’s a reason why brewing at home is such a popular hobby. It’s easy to make great beer at home. And yes, it’s more technical to do at scale but there are \~7500 craft breweries in the USA alone. This is not some exclusive mystical science. 

What about compared to Bud? Cheap beer is actually a triumph of engineering when it comes to making a biological process yield a consistent end product. Those plants employ not just brewers but food scientists and chemical engineers. 

Yes. There are some savings when working at scale but even at the homebrew scale, the smallest scale, I can produce a 7%ABV beer hopped-to-hell using retail ingredients for \~$3/L – and that’s paying for my own yeast. Imagine what craft brew scale and access to wholesale ingredients and cultured yeast do to that. And yes, those are only the COGs, I’m aware, we’re getting to the rest soon.

OK, so maybe it’s all the cost of taxes, distribution, retail space, profit for all parties, etc. That would make sense if there were not some serious outliers. Take Jack’s Abbey. They are a medium sized operation paying rent near Boston and distributing to stores a high-quality, high-ABV beer with plenty of hops for around $3.80/L retail. They also lager their beer which should increase cost as it takes far more time and space than making ale. So what’s going on here?

Simple: Beer drinkers have become highly elastic in their purchasing habits. They have been fooled into imagining that beer is hard to make (it’s not) and that those few extra % points of ABV and those dozen or so IBUs justify the difference in sticker price. **They do not.** 

People are paying for exclusivity and *perceived* quality. And that’s a problem. Beer is the great equalizer. Human civilization itself may have *emerged* to produce beer. Beer, and good beer too, should remain accessible. 

**TL:DR;** The next time you buy the $20 bomber, if you feel like a chump, it may be justified. 

**Why I want to change my view:** 

1. I want to feel like I'm not eating crazy pills when I am buying beer
2. I want to be able to buy decent beer without feeling ripped off
3. I'd like to not feel animosity towards breweries who I believe are attempting to fleece me and my friends",g9ldav,Most of the prices are because of the bullshit 3 tier system where distributors make the lionshare of the profits on the product.,fox32cl,2.2

China's Social Credit System is bad,"The Chinese social credit system is portrayed negatively in most western media. However, there does seem to be some merit in it. If citizens behave well, shouldn't they be rewarded in some way? Likewise, if you are anti-social, then you lose your credits, eg access to public facilities.

But that's just an assertion, and unless one can show that the driving forces behind the decay are not weakening, it remains just that. An assertion.

At the risk of derailing things by way of metaphor, think of things like this:
&gt;A man takes on enormous debt to build his dream house. The dream house is built, and he's living in it. But the debt is coming due, and the house needs maintenance, and he has no money for that. So the bank forecloses on the house. He gets all notices and warnings but throws them in the trash. The court process takes a long time, and during that time he's able to continue living there, but once the process is done he will be evicted. For now, though, he's still living in his dream house and enjoying each day more than the last.

~~It is my opinion that just because the trend of history has been one of improvement (which I *mostly* agree with) does not mean the future will be improved from the present. *But this opinion could be changed if one could show that the underlying drivers and conditions necessary for the improvement are likely to continue, and the obstacles to improvement are likely to be overcome.*~~ Due to poor phrasing  I have confused people as to what I'm trying to do with this. I don't want an argument about the future of the world, this is meant to be about argument/debate/assertion method.

But just claiming ""it will get better in the future because it got better in the past"" is just articulating a hopeful sentiment.

(Please don't try and convince me the future is going to get better in this CMV, I'm focused specifically on this particular argument and its failings.)",bwbonb,"I think it is a valid assertion, that you may not like because it doesn't provide any insight. But I can make a lot of assertions based on trends without knowing the underlying causes. In the next year, there will be more people, the climate will be hotter and many famous actors will have died. I'm pretty sure about this because I have seen this happen multiple times in previous years, and without knowing any detail, it already has predictive values.  Of course next year there may be a extinction event or some radical change that will change everything, but since that hasn't happened in the past years, I can predict it probably will not happen on the next year.

Also I see where you are coming from, I think the predictive power of those assertion are based on the timescale. For example, if I try to say in 100000 years the climate will be hotter, that may not be true, because the trend is different at that scale, it oscillates. If I say that there will be more people in 10 million years, we don't know, that's already on a evolutive scale.

This type of prediction may be as strong as a prediction where you know the underlying causes. If I say for example that the earth will rotate around the sun in this year, I can explain it to you with Einstein equations but it still suffers of the same lack of insights that a prediction based on trends, something may happen that makes the makes it invalid.

But that phrase is still debatable. How do you define better? why you say the trend is better? how are you measuring it?  Still, in some sense it makes sense, for example if you define it in terms of life expectancy, yes, the future will be better.",epx9425,4.4
the big bang theory is the worst popular tv show of the last 20 years (at least),"this may seem subjective, but i think there are enough objective reasons that the big bang theory(bbt) is terrible. for some reference, [here](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls095465155/](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls095465155/) is a list of some very highly rated tv shows from the past couple decades. deadwood, breaking bad, sopranos, it's always sunny... some real high quality stuff. quality obviously isn't always directly reflected in ratings, however. in terms of popularity and viewership, bbt has been consistently the [top](https://bestlifeonline.com/most-watched-tv-moments-2018/?nab=0&amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) [program](https://ew.com/tv/2018/05/31/top-50-most-watched-shows-2017-18-season/) of the [year](https://www.tvinsider.com/241950/top-50-most-watched-tv-shows-2016-2017-season/), occasionally behind the superbowl and a few other football events. and that is well into its12 year run, 7,8, 10 years in.

establishing bbt's popularity is easy and objective. how to demonstrate its terribleness? it is my opinion that the show is not funny at all, but it is objectively offensive and insulting to basically everyone. not only that, but there is no character growth, mainly because the characters themselves are designed to only be shallow caricatures in the first place. attractive people are dumb sluts(penny, zach), smart people are gawky wierdos who creep out women (all the males on the show), smart women are frumpy wierdos(amy). 

lets go thru the cast real quick:

penny: doesn't even have a last name. is attractive and therefore dumb and promiscuous. has 0 personality, once her relationship is established with leonard she becomes nothing but an obnoxious harpy who hates everything and complains about all of it.

leonard: he is short and smart, therefore weird and awkward. he is obsessed with the girl next door because she is hot, and no other reason. he is a doormat for sheldon, yet for some reason (because the writers said so) he enables him and stays with him. 

sheldon: a complete nightmare of a human being. he is clearly autistic, but it is all just for laughs. no sane person would maintain a relationship of any kind with him, yet for some reason he manages to keep 7 people wrapped around his finger by acting like a child.

howard: smart, so a creepy weirdo. the only character that actually has a bit of an arc, i'll get to that.

raj: smart, so a creepy wierdo. so creepy and weird he literally can't speak to women until alcohol touches his lips. this goes on until the writers realize the show is getting more popular and need a few more women, and they just ""cure"" him.

amy: smart, so a frumpy wierdo. comes out of her shell a little, but doesn't actually develop.

bernadette: gets a phd so must be smart? a weirdo, and controlling shrew, made to be horrible since she is at least moderately attractive.

stewart: not smart, but likes comic books so a creepy wierdo.

so this show has a character or character trait that is portrayed in  a negative light that can offend or at least insult basically everyone. hot girls, smart people, dumb people, men, women, nerds, geeks, autistic people, etc.

trying not to go too long, but [character arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_arc)): spoiler, this show doesn't have any. sheldon remains his horrible abusive self, despite getting married and having sex. leonard is still an obnoxious whiner obsessed with the hottie who has nothing in common with him. penny is still a dumb, nagging narcissist, amy is still a frumpy wierdo, she just talks more about how she has friends and sex, bernadette is a horrible shrew, and raj is a creepy weirdo. as i mentioned, howard gets a bit of an arc as he actually does become a slightly more real person and less creepy weirdo after getting married. but it is a pretty flat arc. compare this to the arcs in a good show like breaking bad and you see just how pathetic it is that 12 seasons of bbt gives us basically 0 character development.

a relatively minor point, but i will mention it anyway: all the relationships are terrible. sheldon abuses amy constantly (no surprise, he abuses everyone), penny and leonard have nothing in common and spend most of the time complaining about each other to their friends, and howard and bernadette argue about everything, never communicate, and also have nothing in common.

final point: the show is not funny. harder to prove, but when i watch my favorite comedies like 30 rock, parks n rec, the office, scrubs, archer, always sunny, the it crowd, south park, letterkenny, and venture bros i laugh out loud multiple times per episode even after watching them many times. i have seen most episodes of bbt probably thru season 10, over 200 episodes, and i actually laughed 5-6 times total. watch the [no-laugh track edit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKS3MGriZcs) and see that it is not so much jokes as people saying things then pausing for laugh track. compare that with actually funny shows (that usually don't need a laugh track) and you will see that bbt is just not funny.

tldr: big bang theory is not funny, has offensive and shallow characters, yet was incredibly popular. either convince me that it is actually good or that there is another popular show that was even more terrible.

edit: wtf is up with the links?

edit 2: i should have specified that i am only talking about scripted shows, as reality tv is, by definition, complete trash. while no reality tv is as popular as bbt, it is certainly just as bad.",iw3pjm,"Up until midway through season 5, it was arguably one of the best sitcoms ever.",g5ywfe2,1.5
“college’s” shouldn’t make electives not related to the major mandatory.,"I’m from the UK so I only just found out this was a thing in US universities but it seems like a scam.

It seems that students have to take a required number of electives to pass there major and the electives are not even related to the course. So you could be going in for a degree in history but end up doing a course in foreign language or something else that going to be of absolutely no help.

The only reason I can think for why they would do this is so that “college” can increase there prices ( US universities seem to be radically more expensive than the UK).",irg9wy,"&gt; The only reason I can think for why they would do this is so that “college” can increase there prices ( US universities seem to be radically more expensive than the UK).

All credible US universities, including all public and most private universities, are non-profit, and they offer courses at a loss (subsidized by endowments, government funding, etc).  There can be absolutely no argument that decent universities (i.e. except the actual, unaccredited and unpopular, for-profit ones) are doing anything just for the money, since no one would benefit (except for funding their operations, in which case it's not actually about the money, but about being able to do their job).

&gt; It seems that students have to take a required number of electives to pass there major and the electives are not even related to the course. So you could be going in for a degree in history but end up doing a course in foreign language or something else that going to be of absolutely no help.

The reasoning is that they are, in fact, helpful.

Something doesn't have to be directly related to your major to be helpful to your work (e.g. learning to think differently), and there's no reason college should be nothing but job training.  I may be studying to be an engineer, but I am not going to be nothing but an engineer; my life will benefit from having taken philosophy courses, even if my career doesn't.  (But my career will too.  My education in philosophy has helped me develop areas of thinking skills that many of my peers lack, for example.  And it made me a *much* better writer.)  The single most valuable course I've ever taken was a random elective.

The breadth stuff--which is mostly taken in the first few years--can also help students to discover new interests.  People come in with zero exposure to things like hydrology, surveying, and geology, so how can they be expected to make a good choice of field if one of those might interest them?  Breadth courses, like earth systems (a freshman course), help make that decision.  If I'd been exposed to some of that stuff earlier, I'd be in a different major--although I've managed to guide my current major in that direction since making that discovery.

To respond to this comment you've made to others:

&gt; Can you give an example of your life after college where taking some elective was actually useful.

I'm still a college student, but I can answer anyway.  It depends on your definition of ""useful"".  Do I expect to make money off of having taken philosophy courses?  Not directly.  (The writing and thinking skills will help, though.)  But making money--being a good engineer, in my case--isn't the only valuable thing in life.

And I have benefited immensely in almost every aspect of my life from having experience with rigorous reasoning, ethical theory, and existentialist thought.  I'm happier because I've learned how to deal with the moral dilemmas and existential questions we all have to face.  I apply those reasoning skills and ethical doctrines to informing my political positions.  I've gotten much better at understanding what I don't know, and therefore how to learn.  And so on.

From my foreign language classes, I learned more about the structure of my own language and language in general.  I couldn't be accurately described as speaking French, but learning the basics of it made me better at English (and helped me know where to start in learning languages I'm actually interested in).  Though that one was high school--my university doesn't require a foreign language.

From one of my humanities electives (energy and environmental policy), I learned a lot about environmental and conservation policy and economics that's been enormously informative for evaluating political positions.  No one said humanities courses have to be ""squishy""--we took a look at it from a quantifiable perspective.

And so on.  I can name a few breadth courses that were worthless to me, sure--but far more that turned out to be valuable, many of which I wouldn't have taken had they not been a requirement.  That's valuable both to my career and to my life.",g4ybjbr,4.75
Luke Skywalker was handled perfectly in The Last Jedi.,"I'm sure that there are many that agree with me on this but it seems to me that the general consensus of Luke in TLJ is that he acted completely out of character in his handling of Ben Solo. However, his situation perfectly mirrors Anakin's, he had force visions of his worst fear coming true and in acting impulsively to stop it, he made it a reality. In a self-admitted moment of weakness, he ignited his lightsaber over a sleeping Ben but instantly regretted it and realized his mistake. He himself says""...and I was left with shame."" Had Ben not woken up, no harm would have come to him. And if you really put yourself in Luke's shoes, it's entirely understandable why he would act the way he did. The Empire killed Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru, blew up his sister's home planet, tortured his friends, and most likely left him with severe PTSD. In that moment of weakness, Luke saw it all happening again and, again, acted in a moment of weakness. The shot of Luke's face after he ignites his lightsaber also perfectly parallels the shot of his face after he cuts Vader's hand off. Just a thought.",knzeuy,"Regardless of how well (or not) it fits as a character arc, the implementation is dogshit, because the character change between appearances is far too drastic. Imagine the shitshow if Episode III had ended *without Anakin falling to the dark side*, and we're supposed to just fill in the blanks of how he became Vader. That's an enormous story-writing fail.

Going from ROTJ Luke to TLJ Luke without showing us how we got there (and no, a flashback *later* doesn't work, and wasn't enough even if we saw that first) is bad writing. The entire prequel trilogy is about setting up Anakin's fall; TLJ doesn't give Lukes failure five minutes.",ghqv495,3.25
" To me, it stands to reason that raising the minimum wage should negatively impact jobs and, in turn, the economy.","I mean, it makes sense to me. Employers have to pay more money so they have to cut costs. Especially smaller businesses that may just out right be forced out of business.

I get the idea that eventually the money would work it's way around but if a bunch of jobs are cut first then how are people suppose to get the money that then gets recycled?

However, pretty much any studies are to the contrary. That job growth and overall income seems to range from unaffected to better.

But how can this be? Businesses aren't just going to eat that cost. If they raise their prices for everything instead then what's even the point since people won't be able to afford things again?

Nothing about this adds up. Everything about raising minimum wage seems to be purely positive but I just can't reason how or why. It still only makes logical sense to me that raising the minimum wage should largely be negative.",esisay,"Because raising minimum wage also increases aggregate demand because minimum wage workers have more money.

"Outside of a medical formality, ""mentally ill"" is a completely useless term","I'll start off by what I mean by ""medical formality"": the only case in which I think ""mentally ill"" is a useful term, is when it is used:

* by a medical/healthcare professional (e.g. doctor, support worker, therapist), AND
* for someone who is suffering, or is causing suffering to others, AND
* and who is being treated or supported in some way by the aforementioned professional

In every other case, ""mentally ill"" does nothing more than stigmatise certain behaviours and patterns of thought, and do so in an unfair, arbitrary way. Generally speaking, society calls something a ""mental illness"" when it identifies a state of mind that is abnormal in some way; but what's ""normal""? I put hash browns in my pasta, and I roll my eyes in the mirror to freak myself out for fun. Neither of those behaviours are normal, but they don't make me ""mentally ill"". So the second criteria that is often added is that it causes some level of suffering. Well, again, lots of abnormal behaviours cause suffering. When I have a bad day, go home and eat an entire bag of jelly beans, that causes me suffering in the form of nutritional and dental health. When I have a breakup, and I scroll through my ex's social media posts for six hours before crying myself to sleep at 4 in the morning, that's clearly a very unhealthy behaviour pattern. In neither case would I be considered ""mentally ill"".

My key point is that, outside of the medical formality highlighted above, there is no factor that properly distinguishes between such symptoms and the ones classified as ""mentally ill"". I've already gone through abnormality and suffering; there's also no good distinction made by duration (my therapy-via-jelly-bean process could last me my whole life) or control (it's not like I have much control over my obsessive FB scrolling).

I should note that I am not speaking out against *specific* diagnoses. These are helpful not just for medical professionals, but also sometimes help people themselves by giving them a concrete grasp of what they're going through; they can also be helpful to the general public, to help give them an idea of how to best support people. My objection is to the phrase ""mentally ill"" and its variations; anything that fits as a blanket *over* these diagnoses. I see no reason why someone should be considered ""mentally ill"" when they have depression, schizophrenia or a personality disorder, but not when they get blackout drunk every weekend, or waste their life away on Netflix, or put cauliflower on their pizza. I am of course not judging or stigmatising any of the latter -- I'm saying that the former should not be judged or stigmatised, in the same way.

What do I think we should do instead? Well, I think it's better to talk about ""mental health"" as a level/gauge -- as in, ""my mental health is good today"" or ""he's not having a great time with his mental health"". The main difference between this and what society currently does, is that it completely discards the arbitrary distinctions I've made before. If someone has psychosis and their voices are very distracting at present, their mental health is poor; and if someone's mum has just died and they're crying all day, their mental health is *also* poor. There is no reason to call the former ""mentally ill"", and distinguish them from the latter.

Hit me with your perspectives

edited: added “and” at the top to clarify my exception",e33fxl,"Maybe not the direction you're expecting, but I would argue that it is equally useless as a medical formality. As many hospitals are already doing, the better way to approach the issue of mental illness is to refer to people suffering from it as people or persons with a mental illness. By calling someone mentally ill you diminish their humanity, and imply that the illness is a defining feature of their existence. By leading with the term ""a person with"" or ""people with"" you put their personhood first, and indicate that the illness they have is secondary. Moreover, it properly characterizes the illness as something that can be treated, and not as an innate characteristic. To go even further, for a profession that necessarily has to focus on precision and clarity, calling someone mentally ill or even a person with a mental illness is so broad and unclear of a reference that it has basically no communicative benefit.",f90lrou,3.0
Vader should have killed Sidius or himself as soon as he learned Padme died,"**Major Spoilers for original and prequel Star Wars movie trilogies**

I just finished watching the prequels, and the ending scene felt so off character for Anakin.  Its the scene where he asks Sid if Padme is safe, and Sid says he (vader) accidentally killed Padme in his anger.  Vader then throws up his arms and moans, ""Noooo!""  After this movie its the original trilogy with Vader being evil and serving Darth Sidious for many years.

This doesn't make any sense to me!

Anakin's biggest theme was his love for Padme.  Its his driving motive throughout all of the prequels (even the first movie when he was a little boy: I suspect he only offered to help Jin because he wanted to impress the ""Angel"" Padme and be around her).  The biggest reason he saves Sid from Mace Windu and submits to the Sith *is because* he thinks Sid can save Padme from death.  

We know what Anakin does when he loses a loved one: he seeks revenge.  He killed the Tuskan raiders when his Mom died.  The question remains, who does he seek revenge against when Padme dies?  Sid says it was Anakin's fault, so maybe he kills himself.

You might say killing himself is different from killing someone else: maybe he just can't do it.  Okay, but then I think he should have killed Sid!  The biggest thing keeping Ani loyal to Sid was Sid's promise to save Padme.  Now that thats gone, there isn't anything keeping Ani loyal to Sid.  Part of Ani knows the Sith are evil.  Also, Sid lied to Ani about saving Padme.  Ani should have known Sid was a lier when he sent him to kill the separationist leaders.  It was obvious the seperationist leaders thought Sid would protect them for serving Sid, but Ani is ordered to kill them.  It should be obvious that Sid lies to his loyal servants and doesn't care about them.  

With all the hurt from losing Padme he should have killed himself or taken it out on Sid and tried to kill the Sith.  Instead, we see Vader do nothing, which seems totally out of character.

But Lucas is a smart guy, so I think there must be some logic to Anakin's reaction that I am missing?  How can Vader's reaction to Padme's death make sense for his character?

Edit: Forgot to add, I don't think Sid's force/psychological manipulations would be strong enough to overcome Anikin's emotions for Padme.  Anikian is a fairly strong Jedi himself, and these emotions are his strongest.",kn4nkv,"Palpatine and Anakin had been friends for years.

"The idea that the unvaccinated are ‘taking up beds’, or undeserving of care is wrong and a profound perversion of liberal values, progressivism, and the antithesis of the compassionate goals of modern healthcare","So upfront, I’m an ICU nurse, about ten years into the career.  I’ve worked only in the United States, but have worked in 5 or 6 different states, East to West coast, and the brunt of that has been in Western moderately to overwhelmingly ‘progressive’ large cities.  

Things to get out of the way: I’m vaccinated, I believe the vaccine is scientifically an incredible achievement, safe, and generally everyone who can get it should get it, certainly anyone with any dangerous comorbidities like HTN, obesity, or DM.  This isn’t a discussion about vaccine efficacy.

During the pandemic, specifically the delta waves in late 2020-early 2021, the ICU units I was working on were alternating between waves of dying COVID patients, almost entirely unvaccinated, and being filled with severe end stage alcohol abuse and IV drug use patients. At one point, in a weeks time we went from entirely full of COVID patients, to 100% full of alcohol abuse and withdrawal, suicide attempts, IVDU, and end stage lung disease from smoking, generally in addition to obesity, uncontrolled diabetes, etc.  These other conditions are not new, ICU’s have been this way for decades.  My coworkers were appalled, and the opinion was often that the unvaccinated were taking up ventilators and beds.  I couldn’t help but think; *what kind of supposedly liberal worldview would look down upon the group of people being literally slaughtered by an unprecedented airborne pandemic virus as unworthy of treatment and compassion?*. This concept has bothered me for over a year now, which is why I’m here.

The premise of my position: *healthcare resources since the inception of modern healthcare have been overwhelmingly skewed towards use by people of lower socioeconomic status and poor health illiteracy, and COVID is no different.*  This isn’t rocket science, people with less resources are chronically stressed, make worse health choices, and suffer from more chronic diseases than health literate, well off people.  They spend far more time sick in ICU’s than healthy people.  Robert Sapolsky did a lot of [great work](http://www.precaution.org/lib/05/sick_of_poverty.051215.pdf) on the subject, and “Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers” is an excellent read on the subject.

Not being vaccinated is correlated with being conservative politically, but far more concretely correlated with [being uneducated](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/12/who-are-the-adults-not-vaccinated-against-covid.html) or being [poor or marginalized](https://newrepublic.com/amp/article/163319/covid-vaccine-hesitancy-denial-misinformation-poverty).  *It is still to my knowledge profoundly illiberal to mistreat and look down upon uneducated, poor people in general.  In the setting of a global pandemic and an era of high government mistrust for these communities, acceptance of this view is absolutely embarrassing.*

Common argument I’ve heard and am entertaining; *the unvaccinated simply made one unacceptable behavioral/moral choice, the loads of other chronically ill morbidly obese, long term smokers, and general abusers of their health have biological predispositions for using healthcare resources;IE not their fault.*

Well, yes and no.  Behavioral science is a fascinating and evolving discipline that I’m not well versed in, but vaccine hesitancy seems to me to be an extremely arbitrary point to draw the line between victim and villain.  When a patient is hospitalized for a suicide attempt, we’re saddened that they stopped going to therapy or taking their antidepressants, but we don’t believe they’re taking up a hospital bed, or berating them for this poor choice.  When a patient decides to stop taking their prescribed diuretics, or skip dialysis and ends up on life support, knowing full well of the consequences (this happens *astonishingly* often), we don’t look down on them for it.  We treat them.

This argument is rooted in the idea that some types of people have diagnosed diseases and are incapable of being at fault or making decisions for themselves, but the unvaccinated are not privy to that status.  *This sort of implies to me that we believe smoking addiction or food addiction has biological/social causes and being unvaccinated does not, or that those causes are less justified.* My understanding of behavioral science and human nature is that these processes are more complex and assigning agency or lack thereof in a black and and white manner doesn’t seem beneficial.",sle03e,"They'd still take less beds if vaccinated.

If a person (let’s say 200 years ago) is merited as an important figure for an achievement still celebrated today (let’s say leading a country to victory in war), then I find it wrong to judge them for beliefs they would’ve have had common for the time (let’s say racism). For example, Winston Churchill isn’t being remembered the racism he held which fit with the times, but rather for the fact he pulled a broken country through a gruelling war. In this way, I find it wrong to discredit his works because he was just as racist as any other politician or civilian at the time. On the other hand, if a person is purely being celebrated for something that isn’t today morally right (ie being an important slave trader), then I can understand why they are to be judged. However, that does not necessarily mean that they are to be removed from history",h85oj2,"I'm going to sum up the arguments I see here

• Having a statue signifies that the person who is depicted in the statue did something significant or something positive, it cant be both, or just one.

• Because we see these people as having negative flaws, maybe some people might look at these people and take them to be an example of how to live your life, and take as a role model a person, who by modern standards, is not ideal to emulate.

• We dont want to take as an example someone who did both good things and bad things from fear of repeating (or at least excusing) both their good deeds AND their bad deeds (this might be obvious, but maybe should be stated for the sake of completion)

• So either statues represent ""someone from the past who did something significant"" or ""someone to be emulated/looked up to"", it can be both, or just one. But it seems most people who disagree with OPs sentiment think that statues should be of people who were positive even by today's values/ethics, and not just 'a significant person'",furrh0m,4.0
"The ending of ""Encanto"" ruins/cheapens the whole story. (Spoilers)","While I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, I am not afraid to admit that through much of my first viewing of Encanto, I got teary-eyed. Actually, that might be a bit of an understatement: it'd be more accurate to say that my fiancée was probably exasperated by how loudly I was sobbing and sniffling near the end of the movie.


Mirabel and Isabela's song together, where they ended in an embrace? Could barely see through my tears. When Mirabel's abuela finds her down by the river and the two have a heart-to-heart? Oh yeah, waterworks. 


For all of its other flaws, the movie was wrapping up in a way that felt powerful to me. My heart ached with feelings of anguish, love, and gratitude. I was overcome with it as the loss of their powers eventually brought them all closer together and they could see  and value themselves and each other for who they were, past the ""gifts"" they had clung to, and hid behind for so long. 


A tragic loss still,  their town came together and helped them through. I thought it was beautiful. I was happy for them. 


Then, for some reason, right at the end of the movie, as Mirabel steps up to the door, of their new home, all of the power inexplicably comes back? Talk about a slap in the face. Was losing their powers dome kind of ""punishment"" that they earned back when they reunited as a family again? Doesn't it sort of...I don't know, diminish the whole lesson that the movie was giving off? 

They didn't need that power to survive or to thrive anymore. The gift had served it's purpose, and the loss of the very same gift was a blessing in itself. It didn't make any sense to get it back, and it certainly reinforced the idea that their power was what made them ""special,"" since it came back once everything was all better again.


Listen, I know it's a kids movie and not that serious but at the same time, respectfully, fuck this movie. Change my view. 😂",vhklax,"At the beginning of the movie the powers were a burden—Luisa was strong so she HAD to help everyone, isabela could make beautiful things, so she HAD to only make beautiful things, Delores’s hearing made her fall in love but only from afar. When they get them back, however, they truly are gifts. Luisa can help people, but also set boundaries—use her gifts the way she likes to but not be buried under them. Isabela can make anything. Delores was able to use what she learned to finally be heard and seen by her beloved. 

When Abuela was the center of the magic, it was all about protecting the people closest to you and a sacred responsibility—which makes sense considering when she got it. For Mirabel, it’s about being part of this amazing family, and the magic doesn’t make you who you are, it just lets you be your best you. When they get their powers back, they still help people, but it isn’t Luisa’s strength lifting something, it’s Luisa, using her strength.

I think my 'diversity backlash' around the new Lord of the Rings is less about skin color and more about seeing modern politics get injected into a fantasy story.,"There is a lot of this going around- 'Imagine being upset about a black elf in a series where the trees talk and wizards ride on eagles'.

But wouldn't they expect fans to be upset if characters used iphones or had tramp stamp tattoos?

I think ""Bright"" was a better way to do a modern fantasy story- You can use Tolkien's ideas but if you need to include a multiethnic cast, set it in a time where globalism makes sense.

Why not just make an African fantasy story or Asian stories, etc?

Obviously the problem is that Amazon needs the name recognition of an existing property but wants a modern young demographic to watch it. So they have to make a weird hybrid that ends up causing fights because everyone is there for a different reason.

To me, part of the essence of a Tolkien story is that it's provincial and glorifying an idealized rural England free of modern encroachment.

the Iran nuclear deal was a bad idea,"I'm not an expert on this but just reading about this cursorily, I don't understand the logic of how that deal makes sense in the long term. 

According to the terms of the deal, Iran froze its ability to make a nuclear weapon and will continue to do so for 10 years. In the mean time, it was given a lot of money and opening up of trade relations to shore up its economy. However, there were no restrictions placed on its ability to develop its ballistic weapon technology, or sponsoring terror groups to attack its neighbors like it has always done. 

At the time the deal was struck, Iran was in dire financial straits due to comprehensive global sanctions against it. But just playing out what the deal would have done, in 10 years, even assuming Iran doesn't cheat at all in its agreement like secretly developing nuclear ability, it would be free to develop a nuclear weapon which it could likely do inside of a year, and by then, it would have been in a MUCH better shape economically and financially due to the lifting to economic sanctions and restrictions, AND it would have been able to develop much better ballistic missile technology to couple with deliver its nuclear weapons.

This seems like a great deal for Iran and a terrible deal for the US and its allies.

However, the Obama administration which I respect and some foreign policy experts think this deal was a good idea. I just don't get it.  What am I missing in the logic of the deal?  Is it just the HOPE that the Iranian regime will moderate in the next 10 years and not WANT to get a nuclear weapon after it starts to open economically?",elvspd,"I want to highlight the people of Iran specifically. If you want to know what life is like for a typical Iranian under sanctions (and by the way there are over 80 million people living in Iran), [this is a good summary of what they endure.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2018/08/02/life-in-iran-under-the-crush-of-sanctions/) Highlights: currency value in free fall, no access to needed medications, selling your organs on the black market just to survive financially, heavy reliance on black market for everything... It is very, VERY horrendous. 

Realize that when you are economically oppressing a country, you aren't just hampering its military. You are hurting every one of its citizens, which in this case amounts to 80 million people, a quarter the population of the US. Few, if any, of these citizens have any influence whatsoever on the development of nuclear weapons or any actions at all that their military is responsible for. And any opinions they have on their own country vs the US or other countries they are at odds with are almost certainly very heavily influenced by state oppression and thus are highly unlikely to be evidence of any moral corruption on their part (thus, saying they deserve these sanctions would be incredibly unfair).

This deal improved the lives of 80 million people. SUBSTANTIALLY. Think about your own life where you live and try to realize how much of it you take for granted. Access to luxury goods. A currency that isn't in free fall. A hospital where you can get treated for literally anything. No need to sell your organs just to survive financially. Your version of improving life for your countrymen is things like helping more people afford Mercedes and lakefront property. Theirs is quite literally not dying. Their needs are so much greater than ours.

Any deal that improves their lives should be viewed as a considerable humanitarian benefit, because it is. We have the option of a massive humanitarian good vs using 80 million people as pawns and victims in a political struggle that I guarantee will NOT be resolved by sanctions.

But honestly, the biggest reason the deal was a better option is because what we are trying to do now is [actually helping Iran develop nuclear weapons faster than they would otherwise](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/why-trumps-sanctions-iran-arent-working/589288/). Here's why: massive economic disaster inflicted by sanctions creates a black market and a heavy reliance on it, and who controls the black market in Iran? The regime in charge. They will reap financial benefit from these sanctions and pour them into nuclear development which is no longer hindered by any agreements to deals. We actually have more expedient nuclear development, AND complete devastation for 80 million people. To quote the article:

&gt;But even without such a nightmare scenario, the Trump administration’s approach is self-defeating in the long term. The sanctions will reduce Iran’s pro-Western middle class to tatters at a time when the country stands in front of a major transition to a post-1979 leadership. Regime hard-liners, meanwhile, stand to benefit financially from sanctions through their control of the black market and politically through their control of a repressive apparatus to put down dissent. The net effect is a country with its economy in ruins but its regime intact—a political victory snatched from the jaws of economic defeat.",fdkpm05,4.6

What is to stop Universities just increasing their fees?

Once upon a time fewer people went to University and the costs were much lower.  The transition from an institution of learning to business making institution has allowed many more people to go to University but at a higher cost.  Student loans allow many more people to attend and generated higher revenue for the Universities.

Rather then compete on price, Universities now compete on non educational benefits.  One of the most expensive examples is (certainly in the USA) football.  Do people really want to pay for Football coach salaries of $10M a year.  How does that assist your education?  The average college president is what $600K, are any of these people really worth that amount?  More importantly how does any of these improve your education?

Universities will just take more then they ever did, do we think that is the solution?  Heck, even now people assume more expensive Universities are more prestigious.

What about people who just want to take up places at University, do we fund them because they are bored?  I knew someone I worked with who had 3 degree's, intend to use none of them and intend to not pay any of them back (in Australia you need to earn a certain amount before having to pay back your loans).  Is that the right thing to do?

Government money will only stretch so far, so unless we want higher taxes, or a re distribution of taxes you are likely to end up with fewer people having access to University.

"The Houston Rockets' failure to dominate in the playoffs means their ""analytics"" style of play only works in the regular season","Hi CMV,

I'm a huge basketball fan. Even though I'm only in my 20s, you could call me pretty old school when it comes to my basketball philosophy. I appreciate a lot of the new changes over the last decade, including the heavier reliance on guard play as well as the faster pace of the game, but I think a lot of changes have totally jumped the shark.

The current Houston Rockets are a team that I think represents that last category. 

Now, it's not the small ball that I think is ridiculous. In fact, I think positionless basketball makes a lot of sense in many scenarios. As someone who played as an undersized, basket-facing PF/C in high school, I appreciate the growing recognition that keeping certain players in certain spots on the floor is stupid. 

What I don't like is the excessive 3 point shooting, firing so early in the shot clock, trying to force foul calls, and ignoring the mid range. I also might be one of the biggest Westbrook haters on the planet, and I think the trade for him represents the move towards a style of play that doesn't work.

The analytics argument is interesting, but have the most analytical teams won any championships? No. And before someone mentions the Warriors, please don't. The Warriors from 2015-2019 were a fairly organically created (pre-KD) superteam where Curry and Klay both coincidentally developed into two of the best 3pt shooters ever, Draymond somehow invented a new position, and they had strong veteran presence. That team would have won just as many games without relying heavily on math. Adding one of the best players in the league (KD) just furthers that notion. They could have played very ""inefficient"" basketball and still won.

The Rockets are a very different team than the Warriors and play differently too. I'll break this down into the aforementioned points.

**Chucking bad 3s too early**

If you follow [advanced statistics](https://stats.nba.com/teams/shots-shotclock/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;sort=FGA_FREQUENCY&amp;dir=1&amp;ShotClockRange=18-15%20Early), you can see that the Rockets were one of the earliest shooting teams in the league. They didn't pull up immediately a lot, but they dominated the 2-9 seconds off the clock range. In my view, this is called ""chucking"". Basketball was invented as a sport where you run a play to find an open shot. Dribbling around for 2 seconds while everyone else stands on the 3pt line and then throwing up a contested 3 is chucking, not running a play. It doesn't matter how good of a shooter Harden is nor anyone else. You should want quality shots that go in the basket.

**Trying to force fouls**

This one drives me the most crazy but I can't really prove whether or not it's actually ineffective. It's just entirely unwatchable when the Rockets either chuck and 3 or drive frantically to the basket for a contested layup just to draw a foul. Westbrook (particularly) and Harden would be more effective as cutters or passers in a play rather than stopping play every time down the court to shoot FTs.

I'll just take end results as my proof that this isn't effective. I know that's fallacy thinking, but this isn't the biggest point.

**Ignoring the mid range**

I understand that the math says mid range shots aren't efficient. And it makes sense. Taking a long shot only worth two points might as well either be a contested layup or a 3. But that's not what happens in reality. In reality, most NBA players are proficient shooters who can make most of their open mid-range attempts without much more difficulty than a layup. If teams relied more heavily on middle or late shot clock playcalls, they could set up open elbow or wing shots for two points. I'm no star player, but if I can make about half of my wide open wing and elbow shots playing pickup ball, James Harden should be able to make more.

Underutilizing Carmelo Anthony and trading away Chris Paul were two huge mistakes the franchise made. Those guys are both premier mid range shooters who can simply put the ball in the basket under most circumstances from anywhere on the floor. Having mid range playcalling takes defenders out of position because it requires they stand in no man's land to guard their man. 

**Conclusion**

All in all, analytics might work just fine in the regular season when most teams are playing at 75% speed and traveling 3 nights a week. The Rockets are obviously good in the regular season and their best players regularly lead the league statistically. Playing ""efficiently"" probably helps manage fatigue because running plays takes more effort than shooting quick threes, and drawing a lot of fouls means play stops often. Also, positionless basketball, which again I don't have an issue with, makes subbing easier.

But when it comes to the playoffs, when you're in a series against another top team playing at 100% effort, the analytics game becomes predictable and ineffective. In the playoffs, when teams regularly score under 100 points, playing math isn't a winning formula. Playing basketball is.

The “Artistic value” of a work of art should be judged as it stands on it’s own without requiring further external context.,"**Definition of Art**

*noun : the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power.*

I generally agree with this definition, however I would only specify that it’s beauty and emotional power should be apparent in the artwork itself without requiring further external context, like the emotions of the creator, it’s intended meaning or anything that cannot be derived by the viewer from the work itself.

For example a plain stick figure drawing has little artistic no emotional merit, but add to it the story that it was the first and last artwork of a terminally ill child who is no longer with us, and it will instil strong emotions to it’s viewers.

Modern art is often criticised for being indistinguishable from doodles or everyday objects, precisely because it’s “value” is often placed onto it’s perceived meaning rather than the merits of the work as it stands on it’s own.

This is why beauty is often considered the one of standards for Art, because while tastes can vary, beauty in general is usually universally appealing. While other factors like difficulty and skill add to the work’s impressiveness.

A true work of art should be able to instil awe on it’s own, it should be able to sell itself so to speak, without needing a great sales pitch by an expert salesman to make it more appealing.

Ideally the artistic merit of artworks, should be judged completely blind to it’s author and the circumstances of it’s creation.

**Edit :** Some responses were a bit more literal than I expected which was perhaps a failing on my part to not foresee, in terms of literature yes clearly you need to know the language to read a book, and while I acknowledge that's literally a context requirement, I don't think it would be unfair for me to say given my examples here that, that's not the spirit of the argument.

**Edit 2 :** I am not saying an ugly work has no value as an art piece, I would argue that it probably has less ""artistic value"" but it may have more philosophical and technical value especially if the work in question is extremely technically difficult to accomplish and knowledge of that alone may in itself inspire awe.

A better analogy for my view would perhaps be in regards to food, the deliciousness of food is primarily in it’s taste but others might have a preference for nutritional value, it’s ingredients (vegan) or it’s presentation, and they are entitled to their personal preferences but I would say those are standards other than taste so their primary focus is not the how delicious the dish actually is.",jp2ld5,"I disagree.

Without knowing who Trump and other famous politicians are, 99% of political cartoons would make zero sense. And if cartoons are art (easily arguable within your definition, appreciated for emotional power if not beauty), and knowing famous politicians is external context, I think this is a clear counterexample.",gbcemfg,3.4

"Not immediately wanting to date someone who is trans, fat or a certain race isn't discriminatory, it's a preference.","I've heard this comment a lot and hear a lot of backlash against it. Common opponents to this statement say things along the lines of: a) it's an ""internalized bias"", b) you ""can't rule out an entire group"" and c) ""how would you feel if someone did that to you?"". I disagree with many of these statements but am open to reconsidering. My overall premise is that nobody is ""owed"" attraction, but here is my perspective on this to expand further:

1. Regarding trans people: I think this issue is the most complicated of the three but here are my views. First of all, sexual attraction largely (especially initially) is superficial. Let's use me as an example. I'm straight, and if I see a girl whose face looks more like a guy's than a girl's, I'm not even going to question if she's trans or not-- I'm just simply going to not be as attracted to her as I would someone else who looks feminine. For example, I find Caitlyn Jenner to be hideous. That's my personal choice, but there may be someone else who prefers those features. Furthermore, if I am dating someone who is trans and find that their genitalia hasn't undergone reassignment, I may not want to continue the relationship for a number of reasons, the chief reasons being-- 1) a physical relationship to find sexual compatibility is not possible at that moment, 2) if I want kids, I can't readily have any with the person I'm with. **I'm willing to say that if someone has your preferred features and genitalia, but tells you that they are trans and you reject them right after, you are an asshole.**
2. Regarding race: When I was a kid, I loved to draw primarily with the colors red, black and green. That didn't mean that I hated yellow, blue and brown, it just meant that I preferred red, black and green for no particular reason. Extrapolating from this, I hate it when people claim that racial dating preferences make you racist-- because you probably can't help what you like! I grew up in Singapore and was surrounded by Indians and Asians (I'm literally an Indian-American and my childhood was surrounded by Indian kids), but the first time I ever felt attraction was when I was 5 and watching Star Wars, Revenge of the Sith because Natalie Portman was cute. I just couldn't help feeling attracted to her! I currently am attracted mainly to white and Latina women. Now, does that mean I'd never consider dating someone of another race? **NO.** If someone had all the physical and personality characteristics I was looking for, but was of a different skin tone, I'd be dumb to not date them-- that's why this is a preference, not a steadfast rule. **However, if you put a white woman and a brown woman in front of me and both were identical in every aspect other than race (and I could only choose one of them), I'd date the white woman and I don't think that's a problem.**
3. Regarding fat people: Like I said before, attraction is superficial. Personally, as a decently athletic guy, I want to be with someone who looks like they can do activities that I like to do (hiking, running, walks, some cardio sports, etc.). That tends to be someone who is leaner. Anyway, that's my preference. Others might want larger girls, I mean for god's sake there's literally subreddits dedicated to them. That's not a problem, that's their preference. I think the real issue is thinking an athletic or lean person owes you attraction if you are larger-- they absolutely don't. **Side note: try listening to larger guys or girls about how they want to date athletic-looking, 10/10 guys or girls and see the way they react when you even mildly suggest dating someone who is more average looking-- this kind of convinces me that many of the ""fat phobia"" advocates are doing so because they want to feel attractive for themselves, not for other people.**

Again, I am open to reconsidering my stance on these issues. CMV if you'd like.

Jaywalking pedestrians should be entirely at fault if struck by a vehicle,"I was driving to the gym last night on a normally busy road with 5 total lanes including the middle reversible lane. Being night, all of the streetlights gave that orange hue on the road. Fortunately I was paying full attention because out of nowhere a human shaped orange blob materializes into my vision right in my lane and I have 3-4s to swerve into the other lane. This person was wearing a burnt orange hoodie with the hood on and black sweats, and I never even saw their face as they never looked towards the oncoming traffic which would have helped me see them sooner.  I find it ridiculous that if I were to have struck and killed them, I would have gone to court for vehicular manslaughter and possibly ruined my life.

"As long as the animals are treated humanely and well, I see no problem in killing them for meat.","(My English is pretty good, but it’s not perfect. Please forgive me if I make any grammar mistakes in the following post!) 


Eating meat has always been a big part of our natural life. Vegans are completely valid in what they choose to do, but I find it a bit odd when they say that eating meat is “animal abuse.”

Animal abuse is a horrible thing. Animals should be treated with kindness and respect, for they are living beings as well. Anyone who chooses to treat an animal with cruelty, abuse, and pain is disgusting. 

However, slaughtering animals in order to eat them does not fall into the category of “abuse.” 

For example, let’s say there is a cow. This cow leads a healthy life with plenty of food, water, and all it needs to survive. Once it’s old enough, it gets killed in a painless, humane way and turned into steak. 

How is that animal abuse? The animal was treated humanely and lived a healthy life (until it’s final day, of course). 

We, as people, need protein. Meat is a way to obtain it. If we treat the animals humanely, it’s okay to eat them in the end.

"""respect your elders"" is a stupid and ageist rule","every single elderly person ive met and been around have been conservative, lgbtphobic, extremist, racist christians. obviously, this doesnt mean every single elderly person is like this, but from my experience, this rule is extremely stupid, closeminded, and allows elderly people to hold their age above childrens, teenagers, and adults heads, and it prevents them from facing any kind of consenquences. 

there has been so many times where an elderly person called me gay, and told me im going to face god's wrath, and when i try to stand up for myself, everyone gets mad at me and tells me to respect my elders. how can i be expected to respect people who hate all that i am? how am i supposed to respect bitter, rude, and offensive 80 year olds? it doesnt make sense.

if someone is going to be a dickhead and call me stupid because im lgbt, im not going to respect them. no matter how old they are. its a dumb expectation and should be forgotten. this goes for adults too, i shouldnt be expected to be perfectly fine with grown ass people making fun of me. its rediculous. they need to grow up. 

teachers aswell. throughout my years in school every single elementary teacher i had was so bitter, and you could tell they hated their jobs and would just take it out on the kids instead of quitting/retiring. i had to face humiliation and oppression at the hands of those fuckwads. i now have 5 years worth of trauma from being bullied so hard because the kids got on board of making fun of me with the teachers. 

im just sick and tired of being told to respect and treat people with kindness when all they do is shit on me for who i am and get away with it, because theyre ""older"" im sick and tired of being disregarded and ignored because im younger. im sick and tired of literally everything having to do with age. i cant even vote yet, and its so irritating that i cant defend myself either. im just told to shut up and sit pretty, have manners, respect the elderly.

Big companies aren't evil for trying to make money and maximize profits,"Almost every comment on some controversial business news posts talks down a company for making moves to make more money. Many people portray them as scum bags, evil, and huge antagonists in their personal life for some business decisions that they personally don't agree with.

What else does a for-profit business do? They don’t exist to grant your wishes, to give to the poor, or to make the world a better place. Occasionally they do those things, but their number one priority is to make money, because that’s ultimately what keeps them alive and makes them grow. Anyone who thinks otherwise is selfish and ignorant, because they want the company's actions to bend to their will.

The most recent case on my mind (although there are various ones) is the move by Apple to remove the power adapter and headphones included in the box with the purchase of a new iPhone. They say it will help reduce E-waste and decrease their carbon output. Do I believe them? *Absolutely.* Could it also be a move about saving money? **Of course.** Those two aren’t mutually exclusive.

I know I’m going to be called an Apple Sheep for saying that they’re not evil for doing this, but I would have my same opinion if any tech giant were to pull a move similar to this, be it a direct competitor or a business in an entirely different industry.

Obviously if a company does immoral or illegal things, then that’s a different story. But I'm talking specifically about **legal** moves that maximize profits that a company could make, whether it be removing free accessories, making proprietary software/hardware, increasing prices, etc. When a company has a true monopoly in a certain area or industry, then that crosses into illegal/immoral. For example, if Internet Company X is the only available one in the area and they keep shady business practices, poor support, and outrageous prices, that is obviously an immoral move since their customers truly have nowhere else to turn for an arguably essential service.

If the company made a bad decision, people will stop giving them money, and they'll need to revert/change their business model in order to stay alive. As it should be. If they can find ways to make/save more money and stay profitable because their product has value to consumers, then that is perfectly fine.

As much as I believe this, I'm truly open to change my view if someone can coherently explain why a company is bad or even acting immorally for trying to maximize profits.",jcdxa4,"Would you agree that legal and moral are two different things?

"The popular narrative of the ""opioid epidemic"" in the US is incorrect or off in a number of ways.","&amp;#x200B;

It's a fascinating topic that's constantly in the news, this epidemic is. I've spend a great deal of time looking into it and am proud to present some of ideas and points of disagreement with you all for discussion and feedback.

I'll focus on two general aspects of the common claims made in the media about this ""opioid epidemic"" (you'll see in a sec why I don't like this term):

**Common Media Talking Point 1:**

\--One reason why the epidemic is so alarming because of the number of overdose deaths... But at it's core, the epidemic is due to opioid use being more widespread, thus to solve the epidemic we must get more people to stop using opioids and less people to start them, thus cutting down on the number of users.

\--Opioids are inherently easy to overdose on, moreso than other drugs. Thus we cannot cut down on overdoses unless we cut down on the use of these drugs... To use opioids recreationally is to resign oneself to an eventual death from overdose, and this risk of death cannot be mitigated to any real extent  (this idea is sometimes more implied than explicitly stated). Thus it's quit or die.

*My Response:*

\--I would reframe this ""epidemic"" as mainly being about the record numbers of people dying from overdoses, rather than how many people use opioids at all. Reducing/preventing overdoses (and saving those who do overdose) should, IMO, be the main priority over reducing the amount of opioids used.

\--I would argue that if, for example, 10x more people used opioids than do currently, but overall numbers of overdoses were 10x smaller (even if only per user), then we should consider this to be a highly desirable outcome. More importantly, I think this is a realistic goal that could be attained using information and education (especially, and among other things).

\--Opioids, when taken alone, are in reality not ""easy"" to overdose on (not relative to alcohol and cocaine for instance),

\--In general fatal overdoses are most likely to involve AT LEAST 2 different kinds of depressant drug, such as an opioid and a non-opioid depressant, such as xanax, or two non-opioids, such as xanax and alcohol. It is possible to overdose on strong opioids like heroin/oxy/fent alone, but only at extremely high doses.

\--The average overdose victim has 6 recreational drugs in his blood. Combinations of opioids with alcohol and/or downers can lead to overdoses much more easily than just taking just one drug will due to the effect of **potentiation** (in this article under ""drug interactions"")**:**  [https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics)

\--Side note: In science the ""ease in which some drug can be overdosed on"" corresponds to a measurement called a therapeutic index, some reading to clarify what this is:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic\_index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_index)

\--With heroin and fentanyl, most people OD and die because of combinations with other, non-opioids, or because they are sold something that was much stronger than what they expected. Both of these issues can be guarded against easily with just 5 min of effort by someone who knows what to do.

\--Even with heroin and fentanyl being sold on the street, harm reduction safety info could drastically reduce overdoses by teaching street users just a few simple tricks--but these efforts tend to get undermined and rarely are put into widespread effect; just look at how google removed harm reduction info from their search results, so that a search of ""harm reduction,"", would lead to you getting nothing but rehab websites (this seems to be partially reverted as of today):

[https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/crip26/reminder\_do\_not\_use\_google\_anymore\_as\_your\_search/](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/crip26/reminder_do_not_use_google_anymore_as_your_search/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Common Media Talking Point 2:**

\--The ""opioid epidemic"" is largely the result of unethical business practices by the pharmaceutical companies, such as Purdue with Oxycontin.

\--It is claimed that these companies lied to doctors by saying their addictive drugs weren't addictive, that they paid doctors to get patients hooked and keep them hooked in order to profit, and that in general these companies created a situation where way more opioids were being prescribed than before (or in other countries at the same time), often to people who didn't need them, and this, per Common Talking Point 1, caused the opioid epidemic.

\--Thus, this logic suggests that we should sue the pharma companies for damages (which is currently taking place),  regulate them better in the future, police doctors more so they can't write so many scripts, and train doctors to avoid prescribing opioids, to use them as little as possible for a short a period as possible, etc.

*My Response:*

\--First it's important to emphasize, I don't flat out disagree with all of these ideas. While I do think pharma companies do (and have done) many unethical things and should without a doubt be regulated a great deal more (currently they are the poster child for the ills of unregulated capitalism) , I believe **the government is 10x more responsible** for the opioid crisis, or as I've reframed it, the ""overdose crisis,"" than the pharma companies....

......Why? Even disregarding the most obvious reason (that the government is responsible for ensuring public health and enforcing ethical business practices, not big pharma). Expecting a capitalist corporation, something that exists to make money for it's owners/shareholders, to choose what's moral over what profits.... to me this would be expecting a lion to abstain from killing gazelles because it's less than moral--Such a naive expectation suggests that one doesn't understand the beast in question...

\--I would cite the fact that illegal opioids (those not stemming from Big Pharma) only have \~1/10th the number of users as pharmaceutical  opioids, (that is, pills are 10x more popular than street heroin) Illegal fentanyl and heroin cause 2-3 times more deaths via overdose (first citation, figure 2).

\--Thus, on a per user basis, we can estimate that illegal opioids kill 20-30x the number of folks that pills do. This should tell you that on the whole, the unregulated nature of the illegal drugs (combined with users' ignorance of how to deal with this) is the real cause of the problem.

\--We can thus expect that if every illegal opioid user was given a prescription for a sizable daily dose of an equivalent pharmaceutical opioid, such as morphine or oxycodone, then we would surely see a significant decrease in overdose deaths, perhaps even an astounding decrease. And that would be just for addressing the most at-risk segment of the using population.

***In Conclusion:*** I'm sure you've guessed that this must all be leading to a legalization argument, but for once that's not what I have in mind....................

.........The reason is, I believe this issue could be solved even with better education alone, and that the issue would virtually vanish if we used education in combination with giving all heroin users pharmaceutical opioids capable of giving them the same pleasurable effect (which current substitution options like suboxone do not, giving users a reason to go back to the street drugs, and many more to never get on it to begin with).

Trump is the Most Impeachable President in US History.,"By ""Most Impeachable"", I mean he's committed the greatest (numerical) definitively impeachable actions.

EDIT:   I believe the number of offenses that Trump has committed since entering office that are 'so bad he should be impeached' is greater than any previous president. 

I hold this view because [we have 'substantial evidence' from the Mueller Report](https://www.lawfareblog.com/obstruction-justice-mueller-report-heat-map) of Trump's actions meeting all 3 requirements for a criminal conviction on Obstruction of Justice for **4 separate incidents.**

In addition, [Trump has violated the Emoluments Clause at LEAST 6 times](https://www.theusconstitution.org/litigation/trump-and-foreign-emoluments-clause/) since he took office.

Further, he's had a multi-decades long relationship with someone [who's been revealed to be a Child-Sex Trafficker.](https://www.vox.com/2019/7/9/20686347/jeffrey-epstein-trump-bill-clinton)  EDIT: Not an impeachable offense.

Finally, now it's revealed that he's abused his power in 1) asserting Foreign Policy for Political Gain and 2) Engaged in a Cover Up to hide this from the American Public.

By my count this adds up to **~~13~~**  12 incidents, each of which are impeachable on their own.

To change my view, you'd need to show by combination that Trump Presidency (so far) has fewer impeachable offenses by

Undocumented workers (“illegals”) and non-citizens should have the right to vote in local elections,"My thinking is:
-They’re paying taxes for services they don’t often have access to, and they should get a say in how their taxes are spent
-They’re living and participating in their communities and are directly impacted by local elections
-It’s important to have community voices in community matters 
-It helps enfranchise people to this country and their communities, instead of isolating and disenfranchising them 

If people are worried about cultural immersion and assimilation, they should support this because letting people be civically engaged helps build loyalty to their government. Feeling like you have a voice in your community makes you more connected to your community. 

Also, the US is (rhetorically at least) really big on “no taxation without representation” so if someone is paying taxes here, they should get a vote. Voting could also be used as a metric to support citizenship applications, as being civically involved would show intent to stay and be a productive member of society.

-I’m an American so this is from a US perspective, but I think it applies to literally anywhere in the world

Assuming an illegal is making 25,000 a year they are only contributing $3,375 a year in sales tax (Using the highest sales tax in America in Alabama at 13.5%). But the issue is that 3,375 isn't going to the local area, 4% goes to the state which means the local area is only getting 2,375 a year from a single individual.

Every single human behavior or activity just revolves around survival and reproduction,"Recently, I've been contemplating everything around me and thinking about the reasons behind human behaviors, activities, social norms, or anything related to humans (and living organisms eventually but my focus here on humans) and every time I end up relating any of these things to survival and reproduction including natural selection and other evolution tools. That sometimes makes me think that we are just puppets following our instincts, blindly in many cases if not most, and this is our only purpose in life, and there's no pure free will since our desires will most probably be influenced by this fact and will tend to just server this purpose. 

So I'd appreciate that you give me examples of some human behavior, activity, .. etc that doesn't end up serving some evolutionary purpose. One example I can think of right now is art, but still doubting that this might be wrong.",cb6xcs,becoming a monk or a nun does not further survival,etdhpxh,2.0
"Those in power and positions of authority should ""Play by the same rules"" as their subordinates.","""You know what they say about the Golden Rule: Those who have the Gold, make the Rules.""
~ My Father, and probably others.

While this post could no doubt have Socioeconomic/Political implications, I'm going to keep this discussion to the family and workplace.

My parents were always strong advocates of ""Lead by Example."" Be the person you want your kid to become. But my supervisors at work think very differently.

As a Chemical Operator, (think laboratory chemist but tremendous scale and strict instructions with little room for error,) it makes sense that my supervisor would be critical of any mistakes I make, as a big one could cause tens of thousands of dollars of damage to equipment, lost materials, or a ruined batch.

However, I have caught each of them talking about things they don't fully understand, making claims they don't keep later, and taking extended ""breaks.""

Now, I'm not the best with words. I have an anger problem. So when I confront my supers about these shortcomings, they brush them off and write me up for insubordination as my frustrations take the better of me. Furthermore, they call me out on similar mistakes that I make, even write me up when I do so.

It feels unfair. Because they're in power, they appear overtly self-righteous and unpunishable. And in my discussions with friends, many other Managers are like this.

Please tell me I'm in the wrong. Please change my view or at least open me up to their perspective, so I can become less angry when these issues come up. I fear that if I hold onto this mentality of, ""These people should be held to the same standards as myself,"" that I am setting myself up for failure.

... Also, if this is the wrong place to post this, please correct me, and I apologize in advance.",imqtt3,"different roles have different responsibilities and can be held to different standards.  My last job, a large portion of my responsibility was production support engineering.  when there were issues with production I would investigate and come up with fixes.  Either redesigning a part, scrapping bad parts, changing a process, etc.  

I had the authority to change how the products were built because in the background I was proving out the change and documenting the change for traceability.  If I go up to the line and say we are using this other washer that is twice as thick on this spot now, it happens and that is me doing my job.  If an assembly worker made that ruling and started doing so, he would be fired.  assembly workers do no have the authority to choose to deviate from the process because they aren't authorized to run tests or document which lots of product are using a modified assembly process so if later these modified units need to be tracked down they can be.  

Also, the minute the worker's shift ends, their total responsibility to their job ends.  They don't have to think for a second about what is going on at the company until their next shift starts.  On the other hand, there were countless days where my day would end with a problem coming up and I better come in the next morning with a few ideas in place to get going on the issue.  or for a bigger issue, I could be called in when I am off duty because product must go out.  So if I, being salary and not being paid extra for overtime, end up working overnight to fix an issue so production can startup in the morning, then my manager isn't going to raise a fuss if I take a few extra breaks during the rest of that day because I already put in my 8 hours before most people even arrived.

Now with the Covid vaccine being widely available and everyone being expected to get it, I can’t even think about getting this vaccine without feeling anxiety.

Medicare For All isn’t socialism.,"Isnt socialism and communism the government/workers owning the economy and means of production? Medicare for all, free college, 15 minimal wage isnt socialism. Venezuela, North Korea, USSR are always brought up but these are communist regimes. What is being discussed is more like the Scandinavian countries. They call it democratic socialism but that's different too.

Below is a extract from a online article on the subject:“I was surprised during a recent conference for care- givers when several professionals, who should have known better, asked me if a “single-payer” health insurance system is “socialized medicine.”The quick answer: No.But the question suggests the specter of socialism that haunts efforts to bail out American financial institutions may be used to cast doubt on one of the possible solutions to the health care crisis: Medicare for All.Webster’s online dictionary defines socialism as “any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods.”Britain’s socialized health care system is government-run. Doctors, nurses and other personnel work for the country’s National Health Service, which also owns the hospitals and other facilities. Other nations have similar systems, but no one has seriously proposed such a system here.Newsweek suggested Medicare and its expansion (Part D) to cover prescription drugs smacked of socialism. But it’s nothing of the sort. Medicare itself, while publicly financed, uses private contractors to administer the benefits, and the doctors, labs and other facilities are private businesses. Part D uses private insurance companies and drug manufacturers.In the United States, there are a few pockets of socialism, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs health system, in which doctors and others are employed by the VA, which owns its hospitals.Physicians for a National Health Plan, a nonprofit research and education organization that supports the single-payer system, states on its Web site: “Single-payer is a term used to describe a type of financing system. It refers to one entity acting as administrator, or ‘payer.’ In the case of health care . . . a government-run organization – would collect all health care fees, and pay out all health care costs.” The group believes the program could be financed by a 7 percent employer payroll tax, relieving companies from having to pay for employee health insurance, plus a 2 percent tax for employees, and other taxes. More than 90 percent of Americans would pay less for health care.The U.S. system now consists of thousands of health insurance organizations, HMOs, PPOs, their billing agencies and paper pushers who administer and pay the health care bills (after expenses and profits) for those who buy or have health coverage. That’s why the U.S. spends more on health care per capita than any other nation, and administrative costs are more than 15 percent of each dollar spent on care.In contrast, Medicare is America’s single-payer system for more than 40 million older or disabled Americans, providing hospital and outpatient care, with administrative costs of about 2 percent.Advocates of a single-payer system seek “Medicare for All” as the simplest, most straightforward and least costly solution to providing health care to the 47 million uninsured while relieving American business of the burdens of paying for employee health insurance.The most prominent single-payer proposal, H.R. 676, called the “U.S. National Health Care Act,” is subtitled the “Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act.”(View it online at http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.676:) As proposed by Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), it would provide comprehensive medical benefits under a single-payer, probably an agency like the current Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which administers Medicare.But while the benefits would be publicly financed, the health care providers would, for the most part, be private. Indeed, profit-making medical practices, laboratories, hospitals and other institutions would continue. They would simply bill the single-payer agency, as they do now with Medicare.The Congressional Research Service says Conyers’ bill, which has dozens of co-sponsors, would cover and provide free “all medically necessary care, such as primary care and prevention, prescription drugs, emergency care and mental health services.”It also would eliminate the need, the spending and the administrative costs for myriad federal and state health programs such as Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. The act also “provides for the eventual integration of the health programs” of the VA and Indian Health Services. And it could replace Medicaid to cover long-term nursing care. The act is opposed by the insurance lobby as well as most free-market Republicans, because it would be government-run and prohibit insurance companies from selling health insurance that duplicates the law’s benefits.It is supported by most labor unions and thousands of health professionals, including Dr. Quentin Young, the Rev. Martin Luther King’s physician when he lived in Chicago and Obama’s longtime friend. But Young, an organizer of the physicians group, is disappointed that Obama, once an advocate of single-payer, has changed his position and had not even invited Young to the White House meeting on health care.” https://pnhp.org/news/single-payer-health-care-plan-isnt-socialism/",jzjr48,"**We've been seeing a lot of rule-breaking comments in this post.

Child tax credits make no sense," Families with school-aged children should be paying *more* taxes to pay for schools, not receiving credits. It seems completely backwards that the more kids a family has, the less they pay.  Yet my property taxes continue to rise to pay for schooling all of my neighbors' kids.  This just doesn't make sense to me.

The only counter argument I've heard is that educated populations benefit all, and thus we should all chip in and pay.  I can appreciate this, but in that case we should all be paying equally (e.g., there should be no child tax credit).",g4bsjh,"Kids are the future of a society.

Anarcho-Capitalism is incoherent on the basis that capitalism depends upon a state or state-like apparatus to sustain its essential components,"Preliminary points:

First: I do not require that you convince me that anarcho-capitalism is a *coherent* view. I only require that you convince me that it is not incoherent *on the basis* that I have given and will elaborate below.

Second: to change my view it will not be sufficient to note a fault in how I have *articulated* why I believe anarcho-capitalism is incoherent, but to demonstrate a fault in the substance of my view. If I have failed to articulate my view correctly, I will correct this in replies to a reasonable extent. This is a necessary evil. I am genuinely open to changing my view, but only so long as rebuttals target its substance. To this end, I have strived to be as clear and precise as possible. That being said, mistakes in articulation are always a possibility.

Third: A ""state-like apparatus"" is an umbrella term for an institutional entity that serves all of the relevant essential functions of a state. For example, a ""corporatocracy"" would be a state-like apparatus (it's in the name: corporato-*cracy*, a corporate *state*). In general, I understand a state to be a supervenient regulatory institution with the authority to enforce laws that it determines for itself autonomously.

Fourth: ""incoherent"" here is a technical term meaning ""does not cohere"", i.e., that its pieces cannot ""fit together."" I will argue below why I believe that capitalism requires a state or state-like apparatus. If I am correct, then anarcho-capitalism is incoherent on the basis that anarchy and capitalism cannot coexist.

On to the argument:

Capitalism depends upon the existence private property rights. Rights exist only insofar as their violation implies a genuine, non-negligible risk of unilateral and overwhelming violence exacted by some party upon the violator. This party cannot be the same as the violatee, or else the violation would not have occurred at all (i.e., if myself and my gun are all that protects my private property rights, these rights extend only as far as my line-of-sight, my aim, and my agility in determining friend and foe. This means there are countless opportunities for violators to violate my so-called ""rights"" - and as such, they are not *rights* at all). In line with this, a right does not exist if it can be violated freely without expectation of retaliation by an overwhelming force.

At the scale of macrosocial civilization (e.g., at scales larger than tribes or small villages), only a state or state-like apparatus can consistently exert such force in a manner sufficiently robust to secure the existence of private property rights. Smaller scales (e.g., tribes or small villages), for their part, cannot be sustained in anarcho-capitalism because (by conquest or diplomacy) larger-scale organizational structures will necessarily form as soon as a locality finds it to be in its interest to cooperate with or subjugate another locality. Without a state or state-like apparatus to regulate relations between localities, the emergence of large-scale organizational structure is inevitable, and with them, the dissolution of the *anarcho*\- prefix of anarcho-capitalism. As such, anarcho-capitalism is intrinsically incoherent. There is simply *no such thing* as anarcho-capitalism.

Commentary on the argument:

It may appear as if I have only argued that anarchy *in general* is incoherent. I have not intended to. As I understand it, my argument specifically targets anarcho-capitalism because other forms of anarchy (such as anarcho-communism) imagine the organization of localities in such a way that the formation of larger-scale organizational structures is not an inevitability because the pursuit of profit, and with it, the expansion of capital, would not be a tendency of the system, as it necessarily is in anarcho-capitalism - as such, the state may not be a necessary entity in these systems. That being said, whether the imagination of anarcho-communism or anarchy in general is also incoherent is irrelevant to the view I have offered for challenge here. *That* being said, I'd be interested in thoughts about this as well - but they will be irrelevant to the purpose of this post.",uijgyc,"Things are named inaccurately all the time, it's really anarcho-commercialism",i7dekbu,1.75
Baseball should implement the universal DH,"I’m a huge baseball fan and love the Seattle Mariners, an American League team where the pitchers never hit unless they’re forced to in a National League park. The DH is revolutionary and forcing your pitchers to bat is outdated and unnecessary. It’s throwing away at bats, often creating the need to use extra substitutions late in the game that you otherwise wouldn’t if you had a DH. The “it’s tradition and how it’s always been” argument doesn’t sit well with me. The game has evolved well beyond having a high number of two-way players as they did in the 1800’s and early 1900’s. For the most part, players (ESPECIALLY pitchers) are single-position focused and the outdated rule needs to go",megsi9,"The only reason DH exist is to protect the pockets of teams. They don't want their highest paid players to be injured batting. If you play a sport you should play the *entire* sport.

It honestly takes away from the sport not forcing everyone to bat.",gsgwgj3,2.75
Faceless YouTube videos are a get rich quick scheme,"Greetings folks,

Earlier in the week I had an interesting meeting with a friend who likes to come up with business ideas. I'm kind of suspicious about her ideas because a lot of the stuff that she has recommended me have a very ""get rich quick"" vibe which is not my thing at all (her latest recommendation was that I check out one of those courses with a ""I'll make you rich"" style landing page .... em no thank you). Also I try to make money online by doing things that I am actually passionate about and which I think might turn revenue over the long term. But anyway...

Her latest idea is faceless YouTube videos.

To explain what it was, she sent me this video which I thought [was an instant turn off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPEU4Y7BsiY). The guy is a fricking high school student for one and I feel like his spare time would be better spent offline and not trying to create shady videos on YT (yes, I'm a judgmental prick).

Anyway basically from what I can tell he recommends:

* a) **Finding a profitable niche with good search volume**. Something like technology let's say
* b) **Using stock video footage to talk about something and narrate it.**
* c) **Doing the above many, many times to drive views and monetize the channel.**

To my mind this is the absolute height of BS because:

a) **This content contributes almost nothing of value to the world.** The whole business model is predicated on just putting those annoying crappy spam videos on YouTube which gets in the way of actual decent content

b) **It's a shady and unoriginal way to make money online.**

c\*\*) The whole motivation that this kid has is to get rich quick.\*\* I don't think that any business activity that people go into solely with the idea of quick enrichment is particularly attractive or viable.

Can somebody change my view on this whole business of putting up clickbait YouTube videos without showing your face?

Apparently it's something a lot of people are interested in.

"The Terminator, i.e. the T-101 and/or the T-800, are NOT cyborgs!","In the original Termintor film, Kyle Reese states the following: ""*The Terminator is an infiltration unit, part man – part machine. Underneath it's a hyperalloy combat chassis, microprocessor-controlled, fully armored, very tough. But outside it's living human tissue. Flesh, skin, hair, blood, grown for the cyborgs*"".

This statement, that the Terminators are cyborgs has been restated in subsequent films and restated by the director James Cameron and also by Arnold Schwarzenegger. This has also been used as a way of explaining how a T-800 can appear to age; the exterior flesh is real organic flesh and so will age like any flesh.

However I posit that is incorrect for two reasons I will state below and that in fact the T-800, and all similar models purporting to have human ""flesh"" are not cyborgs but in fact a unique type of disguised android.

1. Reason 1: the spirit of the definition of a cyborg is a being that is a mixture of organic flesh and synthetic components, usually robotic in some way where typically the being sporting the synthetic elements has either chosen to become a cyborg so as to enhance their natural abilities or has become a cyborg to survive injuries that would otherwise have killed them, or, at least seriously inhibited their lives. This will mean the robotic elements are lifeless machine components without the controlling mind of the being they are grafted to and the being wishing to become a cyborg will typically be significantly inhibited in some way by the lack of the components. The classic example of this is Darth Vader. Without his synthetic arms, legs and breathing apparatus, Vader would either be dead or confined to some sort of hospital (where you can die of sadness, apparently). The application of cybernetics to Mr. Vader has returned him to a functional state. However, a T-800 model does not *need* its ""flesh"" to survive. These robots are perfectly functional, understanding their function to be killing humans, *WITHOUT* their supposed flesh. I feel this point alone disqualifies them as a cyborg. They are not a melding of flesh and robotics, they are robotics *coated* in ""flesh"".
2. Reason 2: Kyle Reese claimed that they were ""*living human tissue*"". However, this cannot be true. Their ""flesh"" might appear to be completely human looking, but it *must* still be synthetic, albeit a very good imitation. Why do I say this? Human biology shows us that humans are humans from front to back and head to toe. The outermost part of your skin requires your innermost organs to function and vice-versa. You cannot see your stomach, but without your stomach, your skin cannot function etc. The human biological system is holistic, you cannot remove huge parts of it and have it still function. However, it is clear that the T-800 models' ""humanity"" is only skin deep and that beyond, at most a few centimetres, their ""flesh"" ends and their true robotic self begins. In which case, this cannot be human ""flesh"" that they are coated in. Where is the stomach that feeds it? Where is the heart that fills it with blood? Where is the bone marrow that makes the white blood cells that are present in real flesh? No, this is not ""flesh"", this is another synthetic component of a very advanced android that has a perfectly human appearance but is nonetheless, by definition, not human flesh. Human flesh cannot survive with a thickness of mere centimetres.

Given my above points, I hope you will concede that the T-800 is *not* a cyborg, but rather a very advanced android endoskeleton coated in a very advanced synthetic imitation of flesh.

One last point that supports my position; Data of Star Trek is accepted as an android yes? His exterior also appears flesh-like. He has never been referred to as a cyborg and so should the T-800 never be called such.

&amp;#x200B;

Q.E.D.",ge2dbn,"Terminators *have* to be encased in living, organic material... otherwise, how can they travel through time? T-800 is most likely skinned in vat-grown human flesh that's imbued with self-sustaining nutrients or whatever. Does that mean it is not human flesh? At what point is human flesh not human flesh?

"Despite its flaws, I think that capitalism is the world system with the highest chance of success.","This isn't a new argument by any means, but I've been increasingly broadening my knowledge of other political ideologies for the sake of my own understanding, and can't find a world system (maybe socio-economic system is the word here?)

the threat of nazism/communism is overblown in America,"for the past century or so there has been an exaggerated fear of communism in America in particular. those that know the red scare know what I'm talking about.

after WWII ended, the threat of nazism has been exaggerated as well. even though at the time it truly was a threat, today I don't think both ideologies have any chance at all of making it to the government.

the reason why is because there's already a significant majority that strongly condemn both ideologies. the amount of actual unironic national socialists and marxist-leninists that are in America are so small and so insignificant that it just feels like a joke to think any of these ideologies are coming.

while there is a growing amount of millennials that support democratic socialism, it isn't the same as communism aka marxism. democratic socialism is capitalism with social safety nets. communism is a full authoritarian government that owns all property and means of production. they aren't the same.

I feel that nazism/communism is nowadays just a boogyman used to justify politicians doing other terrible things

German film director Leni Riefenstahl, who produced propaganda films for the regime in Nazi Germany, is said to have influenced Bannon's film-making techniques, with Bannon once describing himself to writing colleague Julia Jones as the ""Riefenstahl of George Bush"", modifying the ending as ""the GOP"" when Jones was horrified.[362] The opening of Bannon's documentary film The Hope &amp; The Change (2012) consciously imitated Riefenstahl's film The Triumph of the Will (1935), which depicted the Nuremberg Rally held in 1934.[363]

"As An African American, I think that it is categorically unsafe here in the United States and believe that moving outside America is the safest place for myself and my family","Hey folks! 

I wanted to get a contrarian view of what I think may be the best move for my family.  Maybe there is information that I'm overlooking that may not make this the best decision. But I love this community and hopefully we can have a nuanced and civilized discussion below.

Reasons: 

Number 1: Safety. 

As an African American male I am 2.5x more likely to be shot than my white counterpart. Which is scary as fuck. 

https://bit.ly/30F3v4o

 
Number 2:  Cost Of Living.

Living in America. In some places are actually pretty affordable. But the cost of healthcare is prohibitively expensive. There are many countries where the cost of healthcare is free at the point of service. Or drastically reduced in pricing.

For instance a family of four in Portugal can spend 1500 a year in private healthcare costs.  Also I'm looking at other places but in terms of healthcare affordability we rank number one in terms of cost for healthcare. 

https://bit.ly/2CCSWqk


Number 3: Work Life Balance 

Here in the states there is hustle culture. Which is getting at all cost. It's all up to you. Which I definitely do partake in. Bunch at the same time sometimes it could seem like you can take a backseat to interpersonal relationships. You're so focused on trying to succeed in America. Even when you do have interpersonal encounters. The first thing that we ask in this country is what do you do?

you only get one life to live. And I think that you should be able to balance life and work. And I feel like culturally here we don't do that. Which may lead to an unhappy or life for some people not all.  

Those are my reasons guys. I would love to hear what I may be missing. But thanks in advance. 

Also as a note. Just so people understand. I really do care about this country. But I always have to contest with the fact that this country seems from the data that I've collected and the stories that I see in the news that it doesn't care about me. 












Number 

https://bit.ly/30F3v4o",hwav2k,"1. 2.5 times more likely to get shot is definitely terrible, but that is still an extremely low number. If you live in a good neighborhood, dont do a bunch of illegal stuff and cooperate with cops if/when you have to deal with that, you will be absolutely fine in 99.99% of cases. Also sometimes other countries are worse in that aspect. I know there is a ton of police corruption in Mexico as well as a few south American countries were it is even worse or where the police can outright steal stuff. And other countries, particularly in Asia and the middle east tend to be a bit less open minded to racial equality. This is primarily because almost their entire population is of Asian origin and they are not used to different races. With less familiarity, people get uneasy, which leads to some form of discrimination, wheather it be intentional or not. I'm not sure about other areas, but its definitely worth checking into as many places are far worse than what we have here. Maybe it's better in Canada, Europe or Australia, but I would guess it wouldnt be better in most other places. 

2. This is true for the most part. It's expensive AF if you want to live in pretty much any urban area. And healthcare is expensive. However, just know that public healthcare in countries is not always the best option. I know that I've seen many articles about how people in canada with major problems (like broken bones and similar injuries) sometimes have to wait hours before a doctor has a free time to see you under public healthcare. This makes it almost necessary to have private coverage of some type to have decent services, which also cost, but probably not as much a here. But still something to definitely take a look at. Also you reference Portugal as doing well under this point. 2 things. Do you speak Portuguese? I visited Portugal a few years ago and can say that you can get by without knowing the language in urban areas most of the time, but definitely not anywhere that isnt urban/touristy. And Do you know what immigration is like? I'm not certain about Portugal, but I know most 1st world countries have a very strict immigration system except the US. In many cases, you will either need to have a very good profession or marry a citizen, which may be an issue wherever you plan on moving, so that's something to look into and consider.

3. Cant argue with this point. Definitely a true statement, especially when you look st vacation time. Just know that there is always a way out of this no matter where you are. Just look up the FIRE movement (financial independence retire early). So many success stories of people retiring in their 30s because they managed their finances well. You can do the same and one you are financially independent, you can decide how/where/when you work. However, this may be a bit of a stretch for the average person. But no matter where you move, you'll have to work to live. And conditions may be better in other places, but generally that means that finding a good job is more difficult unless you have a good career so far.",fz6ge4q,4.0
It would be beneficial for everyone if Nintendo/Game Freak started putting mythical Pokémon back in the side games of the series,"So, for those of you unaware, mythical Pokémon are Pokémon that are completely unattainable within a normal game of Pokemon. Mew, Celebi, Jirachi, etc. are all examples of this. Typically they would be handed out exclusively for an event, sent directly to the players to commemorate a movie or an anniversary or something like that.

However, some time ago, policy was changed somewhat on this. Various side games of the Pokémon series started including mythical Pokémon as a reward for not just completing them, but typically going the extra mile as well. Pokémon Ranger included a Manaphy egg you could send to the main games, as well as games down the line allowing you to get Deoxys, Darkrai, Shaymin, etc. This allowed people to compete their Pokédex even if they missed out on the event, but unfortunately, this practice fizzled out eventually.

Personally, I don’t see why. It seems like a perfect way to get people to buy the side games and make some extra income. There’s even hints of this with Mew being included as a bonus with the Let’s Go games, but this is the first we’ve seen of it in a long time. I think it’s safe to say that events were not the money makers they once were, especially since usually they can be obtained without even leaving your home these days, and promoting side games seems like a win-win for everyone. Fans get rare Pokémon that are otherwise unobtainable, Game Freak/Nintendo makes more money from people buying their games for this purpose, and more people get to play these games that people put a lot of hard work into.

I don’t see any reason against it, but maybe I’m missing something, so change my view.",dvxb7r,It's some thing you think its cool as a kid but you think its just a waste of money and a cash grab as an adult.,f7s8d3e,3.25
Farmer's markets should have the cheapest produce and farm products available,"I used to go to cheap farmers markets in the Central Valley of California and now that I live in a higher cost of living part of the Bay Area the farmer's markets here are MORE expensive than the grocery stores. Local cheese, local honey, local produce, all much higher than shipped from the Central Valley or southern California or beyond. They're passing on the area's high cost of living to us!

The whole idea of the farmer's market is that it has the cheapest produce and farm products such as honey and cheese as it cuts out the middle men, low transport costs, no refrigeration costs. It's just picking and taking to the market. If you're selling your produce for more than similar produce costs in the nearby grocery store you're crazy and I haven't been to a local farmer's market in years where they sell their local cheese for $10 a pound and apples for $5 a pound. Local products should always be cheaper than those that are prepared (cleaned, picked for appearance, packed) for grocery stores, refrigerated and transported or you're just selling local for no reason.",mgmlfz,Are you talking about the ones that primarily offer organically grown and made products?

The U.S. Constitution is not a sacred text and should be changed and updated over time,"The constitution of the United States is the central legal framework for the country. It's deeply important, but there's nothing sacred or holy about its original form, nor its original authors. 

In fact,  the constitution has been changed and updated (amended) 27 times, ""[including one amendment that repealed a previous one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States)""

But as more time passes without new amendments (the 27th was ratified in 1992), the more the public views it as unchanging and unchangeable. 

I'm not saying it should be easy to change on a whim, but it should be easier than the current process to update and amend. And the public should use and interpret the constitution according to what is good and useful in the current context, reading it with a full legal, cultural and scientific history, and not according to what they think the founding fathers intended, nor to simply a close textual reading. 

If it'd be demonstrably better for our country to revoke (or override) any existing amendment, then we should seriously consider it. Whether that be the first or sixth or 23rd.

If the proliferation of and easy access to guns leads to more and more deaths (whether by mass shooting, suicide, or homicide), to use an example that's once again in the news, maybe we should amend the constitution to make it harder (at the very least) to bear arms.

EDIT: I'll concede that the legal process itself, as defined in the constitution, isn't the primary issue. My issue is the popular public perception that the document equates to a holy text, and its authors holy men: inerrant and unchanging for all of eternity.",ux6xh4,Lol you’ll never have the support to amend the 2nd amendment.

"Tom Cotton referred to American chattel slavery as a ""necessary evil""","There's a news story right now that American Senator Tom Cotton referred to American chattel slavery as a ""necessary evil"". He made the remark when arguing that a new educational initiative about American history shouldn't go ahead. [Here's a link to a BBC News story about his remarks](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53550882). 

[Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-tom-cotton-tries-to-clarify-slavery-comment-calls-out-fake-news) gave Cotton a platform on which to say his comments were deliberately misconstrued by lying media outlets. He says he never called slavery a ""necessary evil"".

However, as I read Cotton's comments, it seems like he plainly *does* call it a necessary evil. Here's the quote:

&gt; ""We have to study the history of slavery and its role and impact on the development of our country because otherwise we can't understand our country.

&gt; ""**As** the Founding Fathers said, it was the necessary evil upon which the union was built, but the union was built in a way, as [Abraham] Lincoln said, to put slavery on the course to its ultimate extinction.""

As I read the sentence, the highlighted 'as' is marks an asserting phrase, as we can see in the phrases: ""As we have seen time and time again..."" ""As Ghandi said..."" If Sen. Cotton didn't mean to endorse the phrase then he ought to have said, more simply, that ""The Founding Fathers said it was a necessary evil..."" So while I can't speak to what Sen. Cotton believes in his heart of hearts, on its face this seems like a lame attempt to gaslight people who read his words to mean what they say.

"If I have to intentionally hide a true fact about myself in order to stay friends with someone, we aren’t honest friends.","Long story short, I’ve known a girl for some time now who has become my friend. What she doesn’t know, is that I was in love with her (or to be fair, the idea of her) from the first moment I saw her. When I met her however, she actually turned out to truly be that idea I had of her and more, in every way. No women has come close to making me feel the way she does to this day.

We hung out casually a few times and had an amazing time together, but when I asked her on a date, I found out she lately started seeing someone. She also expressed the she wants to stay friends; I genuinely want to as well. I have done all I can to temporarily distance myself, meet other women, and in general move on from the incredibly strong feelings I had mostly by realizing that she probably doesn’t feel the same way. I’ve mostly moved on but am left facing the following moral dilemma:

If we are truly going to be friends going forward, should I be honest with this girl about the way I used to feel about her? I’ve thought about this question a lot, and have come to the following conclusion:

A friendship based on the intentional omission of true information that would otherwise ruin the friendship is not an honest friendship; I can’t know if telling her a true piece of information would ruin our friendship until I actually tell her. Because it’s reasonable to assume it could, if I want any chance at an honest friendship, I have to tell her about the way I used to feel, even if it’s not in full detail, so long as she understands the basic truth. As it currently stands, all I’ve done is casually ask her out on a date one time; while she can reasonably assume I liked her, she has no way of knowing the feelings I had were so strong that no other women had ever made me feel the same way.

I think an important distinction to make here is that im not saying a friend is only an honest friend if you can say anything to them (ex: tell them off or insult them for no reason) and still be friends, but what I am saying is that a friend is not a real friend if I have to intentionally hide a true fact about myself in order to maintain that friendship; it’s not a friendship based in reality. When it comes to the good friends I already have, there isn’t anything I could tell them about myself or what I think about them that would ruin our friendship. I don’t see how you could be honest friends with someone any other way.",smgwk4,"Telling her will only end badly.

Large social media companies should be reclassified as common carriers.,"Social media has become an integral part of the way humans communicate over the last 10-20 years.  As things stand currently companies like Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and Twitter are private entities.  They can restrict who can post on their sites, and what people can post, in whatever ways they like.

This kind of arrangement restricts freedom of speech in very real and serious ways.  As a nation, we don't allow other private entities, like phone companies, to restrict freedom of speech in such a way.  Verizon, for example, is not allowed to make a rule banning anyone from discussing certain topics on their network, even if those topics are illegal.  At the same time, Verizon is not responsible for the ways that people use their networks.  If a group of terrorists uses Verizon phones to organize an attack, Verizon is not held responsible in any way.  This is because phone companies are considered common carriers.  

I believe social media companies should likewise be deemed common carriers.  They should not be allowed to restrict freedom of speech on their platforms, nor should be they have any responsibility for what people say, even if it's illegal or immoral.  But every time I've suggested this, I get a lot of pushback.  So what am I missing?  What are the downsides of making Facebook and Twitter common carriers?",jncv0m,"US perspective.

The problem is that none of the current solutions are really ideal.  Section 230 was a good idea at the time, but clearly needs an update.  On the other hand, social media isn't *really* a common carrier OR a publisher.  It's something else.

The problem with a common carrier is you basically just make any moderation impossible.  I don't think anybody wants facebook to be like 4chan/b with no moderation everywhere.  That's just insane.  By the same note, they clearly aren't publishers. 

I'm not sure what the answer really is.  I think, in part, it's in clearly spelled out moderation policies with legal consequences if they just ignore them.  I think part of it is in extending some ideals of free speech to private entities, at least in some limited way.  But this is all very complex and difficult.",gb26dy1,3.5
"""Beyond Meat"" sausages are magical"," I believe ""Beyond Meat"" sausages to be an act of sorcery. There is no other way to explain them. To start with, they TASTE like real sausages.

They cannot be replicated in a Star Trek replicator. They can create random conspiracy theories twice as convincing as Q-anonymous.

Geoengineering is the only short-term solution to climate change that has a chance of success,"I am convinced at this stage that any solution that would require most people to change their behaviour is doomed. For instance, the gun debate in the US is completely stalled, even though gun owners are a minority. Now imagine replacing them with meat eaters or car owners who are the majority. The current price squeeze illustrates this really well - despite higher prices, people don't want to switch to non-petrol solutions for cars and heating because those are even more expensive. In short, making such big changes requires big cuts to standard of living for many. 

In other words, for reasons of cost, pleasure, standard of living or simply pure selfishness, most people wouldn't make the change. Suddenly trading off the future of one's grandkids for one's immediate prosperity, albeit cynical, seems quite attractive for most (or at least a large chunk of) people. The governments could try to force behavioural change, but in democracies a strong and vocal reaction is inevitable.

Carbon free generation doesn't seem like a particularly good option either. Renewables have very expensive reliability until viable energy storage is a thing. As for nuclear, the fuel is now very expensive too, and installations take just way too long to build.

Therefore in my opinion the only viable options are (relatively cheap) geoengineering projects, to which most people would be indifferent (with good PR) because they don't touch them directly, and government efforts should concentrate on these. Good examples are space silicon bubbles to increase Earth's albedo and carbon capture using controlled algal blooms (by fertilising the ocean). The success of these is not guaranteed, but at least they have a chance at it. This will buy us time to develop better energy sources such as fusion or good energy storage to move away from carbon for good, which should be the second focus area.",w1z57z,"The same system you mention of people looking out for their own interests powers a potential solution to the problem. In the same way that people can choose to drive cheaper gas-powered vehicles due to the financial incentive, people also bought into fluorescent and then LED lightbulbs. Likewise, once the development and utilization of green technologies aligns itself with the financial incentives, people will buy in.  So what do we need to get people to buy into?  Well, a pair of options that could solve are graphene production from CO2 and Raccoon-Mountain-style energy storage. 

Graphene has practical applications that make it valuable, and people have figured out how to convert CO2 into graphene. So once a method is developed to produce graphene from CO2 efficiently enough to make it profitable, companies will spring into action to capture atmospheric CO2 enough to forestall global warming (and perhaps enough to induce global cooling, but that is another problem).  

If you have never done so, look up Raccoon Mountain. The basic gist is that they pump water up the mountain, then release it downhill to generate electricity. This is potentially one way to solve the energy storage problem for renewables like wind and solar, without needing massive amounts of Lithium or something. It has the added perk of storing water overland, offsetting rising sea levels from oceanic water. Imagine we build tons of energy storage systems like Raccoon Mountain, or miniaturized versions using water towers all over the place. Every billion gallons of water stored in these systems offsets one billion gallons worth of rising sea level. Combine these with increasingly efficient renewable energy, and problem solved.",ignb1ev,3.0
People with an audience have a responsibility to address bad behavior in their viewer base,"The greater the size of the audience, the greater the responsibility. Simply trying to distance one’s publications from anything political, or saying one is not responsible for the actions of their fans or readers is not enough.

If the comment section of your videos or commenters on your subreddit contain hate-speech, implied threats of violence, or textual dog whistles, you have a responsibility to take an active stance against it, or be okay with being criticized for allowing it to occur.

The same goes for publications, news stations, podcasts, the medium is irrelevant.

This does not mean the person or publication is wholly responsible for the actions of their followers. Just like parents are not wholly responsible for the actions of their children, they nonetheless should be responsible for their own inaction or in-attentiveness.

the US invasion of Panama was illegal under both US And International law And president Bush should have been impeached,"So I'm mostly going to focus on the us side of the law because arguments about international law tend to go nowhere.

1. The legislature of Panama formally declared war  This is important Because the American position Wasn't that the whole government was illegitimate just Noriega but by the rest of the government. by Panama Declaring war the US can't have that position anymore, Because continuing to be in  Their sovereign territory would effectively be a reciprocal declaration of war. This is in my opinion half of What makes this the strongest case for a instance of the US Going to war with Without a congressional declaration a act I'm sure I don't need to explain is unconstitutional and therefore illegal.

2.  For the icing on the cake After the dictator was deposed he sought Asylum in the Vatican embassy  Whose legitimacy Was recognized by the us To the extent they couldn't force him out this is another important point, Because the US Did not break relations with the Vatican As a result of this even though they could have. thus recognizing the legitimacy of the Embassy means acknowledging it is a state of war which stops at the embassy further formalizing the status of War.

"Entertainers, actors, and athletes should not be paid more than police, soldiers, teachers, and researchers","This is pretty self explanatory, but I believe that people whose profession is to entertain others do not deserve better pay than those who risk their lives helping combat internal (police) or external (soldiers) security threats. A similar comparison is valid for those who help mentor and educate the next generation (teachers), or those pushing the boundaries of science (researchers).

It has been well documented that people serving in police forces, the military, public education, or research are not particularly well paid. According to Bureau of Labor data, the average salary of a police officer or public school teacher is around $60,000 per year, which I believe is inadequate considering either the risks they face (for police), or the credentials they must attain (for teachers). The average pay of an enlisted soldier is even lower than that of a police officer. A bachelor's is the minimum requirement for becoming a teacher, and I personally know many teachers who hold graduate degrees. Most graduate degree holders make more (in some cases much more) than what the average teacher brings home. The average pay of researchers is a bit higher (around 75k annually) than that of for teachers, but considering that most researchers have advanced degrees (even PhDs) they are still statistically underpaid compared to other graduate degree holders.

The military and police are vital to a properly functioning society, as they either serve to protect the nation, or ensure internal law and order. The same can be said for public school teachers, who ensure an educated populace (a PREREQUISITE and the VERY FOUNDATION of a democracy) in the future. Researchers are critical for scientific progress, which has myriad applications that can help increase efficiency, life expectancy, etc. A good example of this are various specific treatments for previously \~100% fatal cancers that have been discovered recently (CML is a good example that I can think of). Those that sacrifice their time and energy for the greater benefit of all deserve better compensation. The four professions that I have mentioned are critical to society, while entertainers, actors, and athletes are not necessarily mandatory. The world would not collapse without them.

Defund the Police is the worst thing to happen to the Black Lives Matter movement,"I will begin this post by addressing my position on the subject. First and foremost, I adamantly support BLM and their push for eliminating systematic inequalities that are entrenched in the US. The BLM cause is deeply rooted in unrelenting love for one another and creating unity in an otherwise divided nation. You simply cannot argue with the fact that we are all human beings who owe this unconditional love to each other, and no one is inherently inferior due to their race, gender, etc. You cannot argue with the fact that these inequalities exist.

It is from this foundation that I find myself conflicted. BLM protestors are without a doubt in the RIGHT to demand this equality, and the racism within the police force, whether conscious or unconscious, is a realistic place to start. There is a clear injustice that must be eradicated, and everyone can see this. This is why at the beginning of the protests, right-wing media outlets attacked the method of protesting. They simply could not argue with the message of love and unity without exposing their own biases.

With the introduction of ""Defund the Police"" as the BLM rally cry, these same media outlets have aggressively latched on to this tagline. This is what they've been waiting for to use a means to discredit the movement. I fully understand that this line is meant to be provocative, however it lends itself to oversimplification and misinterpretation. From what I've seen, there is even disagreement within BLM about what exactly this means. If we cannot agree among ourselves what action we want taken, how are those we are pushing to change supposed to act? If our message is love and unity, why would we coin a phrase that creates so much division? I am not claiming that the cause is not justified, it absolutely is. Much of the thought and reasoning behind ""Defund the Police"" is incredibly insightful and addresses major issues within our police force. I just cannot wrap my head around  why we would pose such thought-provoking reform and then shoot ourselves in the foot by giving both the uninformed citizen and right-wing media a reason to discredit our cause.

"Religion is not a race, it's a choice. Therefore being anti-religious is not the same thing as being racist.","You can choose what you believe, so having people challenge your belief choices and the flow on effects of those choices to the people around you is not racist, it's a reasonable line of argument.

You cannot choose where you were born or the colour of your skin, therefore challenging people on these grounds is racist and unreasonable.

Christians are not a race but they are a group of people with common beliefs that they choose to believe. The implications of these beliefs on people such as campaigning against abortion is reasonable grounds for argument and is in no way racist.

Muslims are not a race but a group of people with common beliefs. They come from many countries and have many different skin colours. To condemn then on the grounds of their treatment of the LGBTQI community is reasonable grounds for argument and is in no way racist

I understand there are some circumstances where communities will compel people to agree to the beliefs under threat of death, persecution or exile, and for these reasons I strongly oppose religion in all its forms.",jmy0hb,"Protection of religion comes not from the idea that it's a choice, but from the fact that historically there has been discrimination against people due to religion.

---

Also consider that although we have mixed religions in the US, a lot of countries have populations that are predominantly the same religion. We do outlaw discrimination based on national origin, but if we didn't have religious protection then we could discriminate against the religion of that country and it would have a similar effect.

Similarly, you can't *choose* Islam or Christianity if you don't even know that the choice exists. In those countries where everyone is the same religion, a lot of people really don't know that they can choose to be a different religion. They tend to have the idea that you *have* to be X religion if you are from country Y.

---

Also consider that sometimes choice is not a good determination of what should and shouldn't be protected. For example some people are born with greater propensity to commit certain crimes (such as theft, homicide, etc). That doesn't mean it should be protected. Protection and rights are based on what is right or wrong, not based on whether a person has a choice.

For example, transgender athletes didn't choose to be transgender, but people don't want them in women's sports because it would prevent women from being able to compete.

So basically, choice is not the determination of what is a right.",gbgm3yg,4.4
If Republicans were truly racist they would support abortion,"Abortions in the US are disproportionately had by people who aren't white. A racist would most likely support this control on the changing demographics of the country. This issue being such a crucial topic for Republicans indicates that they on the whole are not actually racist and that narrative seems to be false. Unless one is saying they are so stupid they can't sort out their goals and what would most benefit them. True racists and Nazi-minded people (a label which is often tossed around these days) would most likely support any form of eugenics or population control that benefited their goals.

I actually would like to be convinced that this is not the case because I am having trouble making sense of the world on this topic.

Note: I am not a Republican and am not trying to defend them.",uiw3ka,"3 Arguments. Both theoretical mainly as a way to get you to think. I don't believe these but may as well go all the way down the rabbit hole

Argument 1: Priorities

If I gave you a big red button that would kill your most hated enemy for the cost of the one you love the most would you press the button?

Is it possible that to a racist the preservation of your own is a higher calling than the eradication of the enemy?

Argument 2: Support

For arguments sake let's say the Republican party down to the last are racists. The slogan ""arbotion for blacks"" is one of those tenents that cause centrists to move away from you. Perhaps they understand that this specific goal is easier reached when in power. If you scare people in the center they vote for the dems and suddenly a lot of your other goals are no longer reachable

Argument 3: Cruelty

Banning abortions makes abortions unsafe to do. For a rich upper class Republican an abortion is as simple as flying where it's legal and doing the dirty deed.

But you leave the poor with bad options that frequently put the mother's life just as much at risk as the fetus.

&amp;#x200B;

It has to be said agai I doubt anyone truly thinks like this. The idea that all Republicans are racist and that racism is their number one goal above all things is silly to me. But if we're gonna talk about these fictional monsters let's really get into their head about why even they would still support anti-abortion laws.",i7f11x4,3.75
"The Green New Deal distracts from climate change, by tying climate change to left-leaning policy/rhetoric. The bill seems designed to raise republican opposition, and is a disappointment/insulting for people who believe that climate change is the #1 issue of our lifetime.","I would first recommend reading [The Green New Deal](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hres109/BILLS-116hres109ih.pdf) if you haven't already, its about 14 pages, with huge spacing (about 3-4 real pages).

But to summarize the bill in my own words, the Green New Deal calls for essentially every democratic agenda to be passed into law(to include climate change). As a democrat, I agree with most of the agenda items(it's literally the democratic agenda), but there is something wrong with creating a bill like this.

By tying together climate change, and a plethora of other issues, like equal protection and rights for illegal immigrants, government-run(?) healthcare for all, etc, it is ensuring intense opposition by non democrats.

Since I do not believe any rational human being could read the bill, and think it would get bi partisan support, my view is that there was no real intention of ever getting the bill passed into law/policy.

(Sure, the gender wage gap is important, so are Native American rights... But there's no need to make that stand on a climate change bill, and doing so is insulting to the Americans who want to see huge climate change initiatives as our national policy)

**The abridged, loose, logical argument:**

Premise 1) If you want a bill to get passed into law, when possible, you will write it in a bi partisan way.

Premise 2) Climate change can be written in a Bi-Partisan way

Premise 3) The Green New Deal was not written in a bi partisan way(or was written in a partisan way).

Conclusion) The Green New Deal was not written to be passed into law.

(And this disappoints me, because in my opinion, climate change is the #1 issue of my lifetime.)

Edit 1: I learned that the intent of the bill wasn't necessarily to pass something into law, but more of a political statement or some sort of rally cry. Not sure how I feel about that one or what changes, but its worth noting. (its a function of a specific type of house resolution)

Edit 2: After reading some of these posts, I now realize that the Green New Deal is actually divisive within the democratic party, and received a (soft) ""bipartisan"" rejection in the senate. This seems to indicate the increased importance of having a specific targeted bill, as it seemed some senators did not want to go on record supporting it, because of what it said.",l9ssyl,"I would disagree with premise 1. We haven't had a bipartisan bill in at least 12 years. The republicans blocked obama, even when he literally supported republican bills. The Dems fought trump as hard as they could.

As such, it literally doesn't matter what the bill says. The bill could say, Mitch mcconnell gets infinite blowjob's, but if aoc votes for it, he won't. So why bother toning it down, if you have the majority, you may as well turn it up to 11, you won't get any more or less support.",glk26b4,3.5
It should be illegal to put down a healthy animal in the United States,"The state should also be held to this rule. Annually in the USA spends about 2.5 billion on animal shelters. About 800 million of this is privatized leaving the government's cost at about 1.7 billion. 

Meanwhile we spend near 800 billion on welfare, 900 billion on military and 600 billion on schools. I think we could fork over an extra billion or two to cover the 1 in 3 animals that are put down every year by shelters and give them a better quality of life. 

I think the main counterargument would be that its not a great quality of life for some animals that can't get adopted, but dogs and cats both do just fine without humans. Dogs do great when paired in large spaces with other dogs. Cats do great with shared playroom with other cats. And there is plenty of empty government owned land to build shelters on.",k9avz0,"What should the penalty be for putting down a healthy animal, and who gets to decide whether the animal is healthy or not?",gf3hzdi,2.25
Civil forfeiture does not respect due process.,"CMV: In civil forfeiture law enforcement takes money or other assets suspected of being involved in criminal enerprise. The owner has to prove that this was not the case for them to get the asset in question back. This moves the burden of proof to the individual and, in my opinion, goes against the presumption of innosence. Furthermore one cannot prove negative, i.e. the absence of criminal behaviour. The burden of the proof in similar cases in other countries that I know of is on the law enforcement.

Someone who commits a horrible crime (eg. Murder or Rape) deserve the death penalty.,"This is solely about the 'deserve the death penalty' part of my view. For arguments sake, let's leave the fact that people can be wrongfully accused or be set up. I'm talking about people that have beyond a doubt committed a horrendous crime deserve to die.

In my eyes, there is nothing that can excuse crimes such as murder, rape, or bashing someone near to death. Anyone who has the capability to cause either fatal or such extreme harm to another living thing is in no way deserving of continuing to live.

You often hear people advocating against the death penalty say (and a TED talk on this topic featured this argument) that some people who murder don't deserve to die. That they had a shocking upbringing and fell in with the wrong crowd. They would never have done it if life wasn't so harsh for them. To me this isn't good enough. You've destroyed a life. You've ended the existence of a conscious being. A family now has a giant emptiness in it. There's a friend's left devastated. Kids now have to grow up without a parent. How can someone murder someone, knowing the impacts it'll have, not be deserving of the death penalty?

For crimes other than murder my view remains similar. For rape and bashings. You've still destroyed a life. Maybe more than one life. You've traumatised a person. Anyone who could do that simply isn't a person who's necessary to keep alive in this world. A person capable of these things is only a detriment to the human race, and so should be removed from it.

I understand that not all cases are so black and white. For example if you murdered someone who was truly an evil person who deserved it, my views are different. So for the sake of the discussion I'll make it as black and white as I can. We're talking about people who commit these crimes against innocent and completely undeserving victims.

EDIT: Im not sure how well I did at making it clear what I want people to challenge me on. This is not a debate about the complex issue that is implementing the death penalty. This is purely, on a basic fundamental level, does someone who commits a horrible crime deserve death?",ces44t,"If rape becomes a crime that can lead to the death penalty, the same as murder, there is no longer an incentive to leave your rape victim alive.",eu5y207,3.0
"If you believe in a progressive tax system, you should also support big social media regulation.","As I understand, a progressive tax system is a system that taxes based on different thresholds / tiers depending on how much money a person or corporation makes. This system means that depending on how big you are, you are treated differently. I’ve heard multiple justifications for it. Some relate to exploitation, others to societal progress, and others even think that this system is more fair that just a standard flat tax rate. I’m personally torn on the issue but then to agree as long as the place their taxes are going to are being used effectively.

With some social media companies becoming very big, I think a similar principle should apply. If you get too big like Facebook or Twitter where you basically become a default online public square, you should have some regulation that prevent some of the issues that come with that status. It is certainly unreasonable to expect Twitter to be as open as it is but also be as regulated as what a newspaper publishes, but I think regulations like applying terms of service fairly, bipartisan fact checking, holding audits to their algorithms, or forcing them to have unbiased options (like chronological order) for presenting user selected information can lead to help mitigate the dangers of social media we are seeing.

Main point, if it is fair to tax differently depending on the level of financial success it is also fair to apply different standards based on other types of success.",ku4hr3,"I don't see how the two issues are really connected. 

Progressive taxation is a question of how best to fund the services expected of the state. I don't think the the main arguments for it depend on the idea that any one person has become so rich that their assets dominate the society. 

The question of regulating social media firms hinges on whether they are so ubiquitous that they have become a public space. Or whether they are such important sources of information to the public that the state should ensure the information provided is balanced and accurate. 

I think that a compelling argument can be made in each case, but I don't think they're rooted in the same principle.",gipx4qj,3.5
We don't have free will because we can't choose what we like.," 

I  want to believe in free will, I really do, because without free will  then people are just mindless automatons but I just can't believe in it  the concept. The one thing stopping me from accepting free will is the  fact we can't choose what it is that we like.  We can't choose our  personality, we can't choose what foods we like, we can't choose who we  fall in love with. These actions or events simply happen.  Our  personality is just who we are.

Say  a moral person decides to commit an evil act. If people had free will  they would just simply choose to commit an evil act. But a person who is  moral will not commit an evil action because it feels wrong and goes  against his morality and personality. He can't simply decide he likes  doing immoral things, because he is unable to force himself to enjoy  immoral actions. He can't simply change his desires at all. Changing  desires is not something a person is able to do. You can't choose to  stop loving a person. You will love that person regardless of what  actions you take. No matter what you will love that person until an  action happens upon you that makes you lose that love.  Outside forces  are always acting upon us and molding our desires and personalities and  there's not a damn thing we can do to stop it.

I hope this makes sense because I am terrible at getting my word across.",f4isx4,"You can definitely control what you do as the creature that you currently are.

"There's a good chance we'll never meet ""alien"" life forms","I'll make my point from an ""abiogenesis"" pov, adressing life as a freak mechanical/chemical accident or even working through the idea of life being a way to achieve removal of excess energy, mostly along the ""dissipation driven adaptation"" model by Jeremy England.

Secondly, if the whole infinite universes idea make that 0.0001% chance seem good enough to happen elsewhere, the fact that so far living organisms as we know them are quite short lived and inequipped for travel, especially relative to planet life and distances involved, meaning that there might have been life at other places that we missed, and we might die out with our sun before another begins, and while prosthetics and organ replacement tech are promising, brains still die from age.

China is only communist by name,"They have a stock exchange and many aspects of a capitalist economy. Consumerism is a defining characteristic of the Chinese economy.

The only thing is that the CCP has full regulatory power, so in that sense it is a “planned” economy, but it still favors these capitalist practices. Concepts of debt and investment are hallmarks of the Chinese economy, just like in the US. Many OG Communist leaders were jailed (the Gang of Four).

most new genders and gender labels are not productive to have in the long run,"
Right now US, and in lesser extent other western countries, cultural and social complexes are centred around “identity”. Knowing to what group you belong and what name you give to that group is very important for your personal identity. Delineations of Identity are thus very important, and things like racial categories and gender categories become very important to define and identify with.

I understand how making a new gender can benefit the people who don’t feel like the other genders there are. But to me, this only makes sense in a cultural complex where identity groups are very important.

In this cishet society it makes sense to create another gender if you don’t feel at home.

But in the bigger picture, why the emphasis on gender? Shouldnt the better course of action be to let biological sex be biological sex. And then to let everyone be their unique person without having to give who you are a name? Why make your gender identity so important to who you are?

For context: I live in a country where American identity and gender ideas are gaining ground. I think there are things to gain from cultural exchange with the US, but it feels like the “American” focus on gender(eg everyone putting pronouns in your bio, creating a new gender whenever you don’t feel any existing ones represent you) goes too far beyond “accepting differences” and perpetuates the culture of identity",ru9qs8,"&gt; But in the bigger picture, why the emphasis on gender?

Women should not be expected to assume their husband’s last name when getting married.,"This feels like an outdated and frankly sexist tradition that is a relic of a patriarchal society. As we move toward a more egalitarian society where women and men are regarded as equals, I see no compelling reason for women to change their last names when they get married.

Hyphenating is a recent attempt to split the difference but it still puts the burden on the woman. We don’t see many men hyphenating their last names along with their wives’ last names. 

Aside from the philosophical arguments of fairness and equality, there are some tangible costs to legally changing a name. It’s burdensome from an administrative/paperwork point of view and can be disruptive as the woman manages the name change for years to ensure its been updated in all the right places.

Please note that I’m not commenting on what the husband and wife should use as their children’s legal last names.

having a non binary social stance is counterproductive and exhibits victim mentality. it's an empty social statement.," I respect these people on a surface level, and will use noxnbinary pronouns to refer to someone if I’m asked, but I actually think the whole statement is unnecessary…and honestly…immature. I think the whole concept is divisive and separates people even more than they already are. i've had discussions with NB individuals over the years, and my conclusion is most of these people just want to be victims.it’s just a way to be apart of the lgbtq community because that’s what “in” right now. Everyone wants to be apart of a marginalized group until they are apart of said group. It’s a cliquey, pretentious subculture in my opinion. I’ve seen people post on facebook etc seeking out book recommendations that don’t use gendered language because it makes them dysphoric. how many works of literature does that exclude? Pretty much all of them. i think upholding this view point makes the individuals identifying as such more closed minded. the whole concept of being non binary and barking at everyone over it is counterproductive and obnoxious in all honesty. it demonizes people who have no ill intent. how would someone know if they ""felt"" like a woman or a man? i don't identify with someone because we share a gender...at all. i identify with someone because who they are, what they've experienced and what they think. we have one body, i don't understand how someone would know the difference. if this non binary phenomenon never came about, i don't think most people would think about it at all. there's plenty of aspects about being female that make me uncomfortable, too. i don't like being objectified. i don't think i should have to uphold beauty standards presented to me by society. the idea of being pregnant freaks me out. i am uncomfortable when i'm menstruating. does that make me disconnected from my sex? maybe? i understand having a fluid sexuality, being androgynous etc. i think people should be themselves. just because you are born being male or female doesn't mean much when it comes to individuality, really. it's arbitrary...but i think its counterproductive to be all ""i'm neither of these"", ""i don't like cisgendered people because they don't get it."" ""I'M DIFFERENT!"" i'm fucking different too, we all are. to me, it's an unnecessary statement that isn't actually saying anything. it's 2020 and we don't need to conform to gender roles, but what's the point of saying you're neither sex when you are biologically? that's all that being male or female is, really.",g1x5nf,"There are a limitless number of choices we make, down to the most banal details of which direction to place the toilet paper.

The racist one-drop rule from America's slavery era is still being used,"During slavery, they invented something called the one-drop rule which declared that a single drop of nonwhite blood turns a person into a full nonwhite. Today, the one-drop rule is still being used.

One example to support my claim is the fact that mixed-race black people are pressured to identify as full black, even when they are technically part-white or part-asian. Obama is half white, but both Republicans and Democrats treated him like a full black. Why? Because that African blood supposedly turned him into a full nonwhite... even though he is considerably lighter than his black father...

There are other small examples such as ""minorities"" and ""BIPOC"" being code for nonwhite, but the main example is what happened to Obama. The racist one-drop rule from America's slavery era is still being used and the rhetoric surrounding mixed-race people is proof",vdzwpl,"So this is sort of true, in that whiteness has almost always been defined as an exclusion of other races and so people who are mixed race are often pressured to self-identify as non-white or mixed race rather than white.  However, there are no longer any legal prohibitions for people who are mixed-race identifying as white, or indeed many Hispanic people who are relatively dark skinned identifying as white. As a result, plenty of people who are mixed race or Hispanic identify as white even though in the past they would not have done so.

They don’t have a great location, they don’t have many efficiencies up the supply chain but they want to provide some good music and culture in the community while earning a living. They do paint-ins, live music, workshops, all that good stuff. So what they do is hire high school kids for about 4,000 hours a year on $11/hour. The kids have no rent and no bills aside from maybe gas and insurance. They gain experience while earning income in a cool work environment. Kids are happy, record store owner is happy, community is happy. With a $15 minimum wage, now the staffing costs go from 44k per year to 60k per year. The numbers no longer work and they have to close their doors. 

My proposal is to have minimum wage based on tax brackets. I don’t know the exact numbers but for places like McDonalds and Walmart the minimum wage would be $15, they can’t continue to abuse marginalized communities for their shareholder gain. For small businesses, it would be lower.  It’s a way of stimulating the economy without spending any tax payer money (aside from the costs of writing and implementing the legislation.) 

That record shop would be forced to offer other perks to make up for the wage difference: You get to book the venue and MC all the live shows, you help put together the order with your favorite music, you get to choose all the art to display, etc. I believe this would further stimulate the next generation of innovations in the local business community. 

Ways to change my view: demonstrate that local businesses could easily absorb the impact of the minimum wage increase. Demonstrate that this policy would be too hard to enforce. Demonstrate that big business could find a way to abuse this policy. Probably some other ways too.",lffrob,"I'd argue there is an even simpler solution: Eliminate minimum wage entirely and institute something akin to UBI.  If someone is entitled to earn a ""living wage"", I don't see why whoever chooses to give them any money at all is entitled to give them enough to live. And why are people with jobs more entitled to enough to live on than someone who doesn't currently have a job?",gmo1io3,2.8
Punishment is a broken system for behavioral change,"Change my view: Punishment is a broken system for behavioral change. I have felt this way for my whole life, because my parents never punished me in my upbringing. This makes me confident in my point of view, because I was never punished and I turned out fine. I know a lot of people swear by their parents choice to punish them, saying that it was the best thing for them. I think that people feel this way because they don't understand how to create behavioral change through other methods.


I think the fact that so many people rely on punishment as a corrective measure says a lot about our society. We believe that our words and actions are not powerful enough to change each other's minds, and this belief manifests  as violent and nonsensical actions. This is obviously a harmful pattern.


I believe that the cycle of violence continues and is supported by punishment. If a citizen needs a job, but is discriminated against and cannot find one, there is a large chance they could turn to crime. The punitive Justice system doesn't account for the extreme consequences that follow being imprisoned, like the fact that it is extremely difficult to secure a good career after being imprisoned. After going through prison or jail, people have inordinately lesser chances to join society normally. If people are so far gone and unable to join society because of their habits and mindset, they should get help, not punishment. 

This applies to children in the sense that their relationships with family are damaged, and will remain that way unless parents make amends. Children also are more likely to be violent when they experience violence. Everyone learns how to treat each other from the way they are treated, and children are even more mentally malleable at that time in their lives.",dda9ar,"I'll preface this by saying I largely agree with you. What I'd ask first, though, is when you say you turned out fine, was that *because* of the lack of punishment, or *in spite* of it? It's hard to sort of quantify the effects of one aspect of your upbringing when of course there've been so many more. 

I agree also that the more meaningful the goal that we're trying to achieve is, the less effective punishments are as a means to that end. But what if our goals are markedly less ambitious? What is the issue with punishment, for instance, as a way to combat drivers speeding in a residential area? Sure, we'd *like* it if people were aware of the risk they're posing to other people when they speed, but what we *need* is to stop them from speeding. Putting up a speed camera and dishing out hefty fines to people caught speeding seems like a good way to modify that particular behavior; we're not particularly interested in their motivation for speeding. 

I'd argue that for some of the more low-hanging fruit types of behavior, punishment works just fine as a system for effecting behavioral changes.",f2fug10,4.25
Activism is pointless unless you can change voters' minds,"# 

As an Australian, I frequently encounter Reddit and Twitter content lambasting Australia for our atrocious treatment of asylum seekers. But while I do support a decent treatment of asylum seekers, I also must admit that I believe that activism to protest Australia's treatment of asylum seekers is pointless unless you can change voters' minds.

A survey taken in 2018 showing that Australians are overwhelmingly anti-immigration [is frequently cited by anti-immigration parties to claim that the major parties have abandoned the desires of the people](https://twitter.com/Progressive_Con/status/1354749767247532035). A more recent survey taken in 2019 shows an improvement, [showing that merely 1/3 of Australians want less immigration, and almost 1/2 support boat turnbacks](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-24/vote-compass-election-immigration-asylum-seekers/11038070) (which is admittedly still a dismaying figure).

The reason I bring these up is to show that sentiment against immigration and asylum seekers is common in Australia, so no wonder the party responsible for mistreating asylum seekers is able to win the elections without electoral fraud. Back to the point, it also goes to show that lambasting Australia on social media, or going further and sanctioning or boycotting Australia in protest of the treatment of asylum seekers, is pointless because it doesn't change voters' views.

I also believe that the concept of ""*Activism is pointless unless you can change voters' minds*"" applies to different political issues too. For example, the anti-abortion laws in Poland, the anti-LGBT laws in Hungary, or the extrajudicial killings in the Philippines (and those are just the ones off the top of my head). Activism against these is also pointless unless you can convince the voters to not support such policies. Until you achieve that, these will continue, because the voters will keep voting to continue them.",ly1qmn,"In many cases, activists don't need to change voters' minds. They just need to get the people who already agree with them to vote more often, to pay attention to the issue more when they are voting, and to petition their representatives more about the issue.",gpqa2ez,3.25
we all have the right to die,"I think it is a bit odd that we, as a society, assert that living is better than dying. We are invested in keeping people alive and it just seems unethical to force people to stay alive if they do not wish to for whatever reason. We did not exactly make any agreements to only die of natural causes (And isn't depression or boredom or trauma or societal injustice also part of nature?). The current right to die discussions are around people suffering in severe measurable ways for a long time. Why is it reserved for only this group? Should it not just be our choice whether we consent to living or not? I'm just unsure why we would want to keep people hostage to ""life"" if they do not want to, regardless of whether it is rational or not by society's measures. I, of course, mean situations where it is truly ones own decision and there is no coercion by another person.

I understand there is a utilitarian argument to be made around keeping people alive. However, the choice to live is so so so personal and we should have the freedom to step out. Utilitarianism can be quite problematic at times ignore personal freedoms.

To be more specific--

We know that mental and emotional suffering is real and has an expansive impact on someone's quality of life and on those around them. There are ongoing discussions around the right to die in terms of euthanasia and suicide as well. I believe that people who have mental illness or have experienced trauma they are unable to live with should be allowed to end their lives-- why is this is a problematic view? I understand that a lot of the right to die literature discusses rational suicide and the concept of making informed rational decisions. But we are depriving people of their reality if we claim that mental illness distorts reality in a way that is unworthy of being taken seriously-- it does impact their reality, that is precisely the point. We all have our own realities and for some it is more painful that others. That does not make it less real or rational though.

Secondly, some people experience systemic barriers that really diminish their quality of lives and makes things unbearable. Why are those cases left out of consideration?

To be clear, in this example I am talking about ""while I appreciate and love life, it has been too painful for too long and I have tried several methods to improve things but it has not helped. So I have to leave"" vs ""I am in pain right now so I must die even though it has not been a long term experience"".",kx6pzi,You have the right to die but not the right to other people helping you do that.,gj8jawd,2.5
American job benefits are becoming irrelevant and are no longer as important to consider when applying for jobs as a young professional.,"I want to start off with saying I'm aware I haven't researched this enough, and that's why I'm reaching out to get several different opinions and see if anyone else feels similarly. I feel truly naive about the subject, but unfortunately I don't think I learned much from my college personal finance class.

Now that I'm in my mid-twenties, a number of Boomers in my life have suggested the importance of finding a job with good benefits. I, however, look for a job with a good reputation that will help me build a resume and continue learning skills for future positions and opportunities. Obviously, the ideal is a position that offers the best of both worlds, but it's just not that simple in my industry (restaurants/hospitality). Here are my thoughts.
Social Security: can we even rely on this anymore? Will it still exist when I finally have the opportunity to use it? I know it's required but it truly feels like a waste when you're living paycheck to paycheck. Perhaps not included in the category, but I think it's important to bring up.
Healthcare: Yeah, it's expensive on its own. I'd rather advocate for affordable healthcare. We end up paying exorbitant amounts anyway for terrible plans, so what's the point? I'm healthy, and my job depends on me being physically fit so will it really help me? Or will a medical emergency bankrupt me either way?

Life insurance: I don't have any worth at this point nor anyone I want to gain anything from my death. Maybe 10 years from now?

Vacation packages: Really unnecessary for me, if I can't make enough to afford a decent vacation anyway. Plus, I live to work and I would rather have a great job and no vacation than a decent job and a week or 2 a year off.

Retirement plans? Give me a break. If you gave me that money now I could actually use it and potentially have a decent life before I turn 60 or 65 or later. Maybe even invest it (through starting a business young, etc) and make more than what I'll earn from ""saving"". I can't imagine working for the next 40 years only to have enough money to do the things I've wanted but can't because I've developed health issues, or have sick relatives to care for, etc. Retirement seems like the biggest con out there and I've never seen it explained in a way that encourages me to pursue it. If I make enough money to save , it will go into a project to improve my life ASAP and to have available if life gets rough. Am I underestimating the value of the tax deductions?

Sick leave can be helpful, and crucial if you're prone to health issues. But the majority of what a healthy person needs should be covered in some way by the job already. But what am I missing here?

Plus, if we don't improve the healthcare and school systems, I won't be having kids. So that's an extra 250 grand+ I'll have at my disposal (not even going to go into how much college or competent childcare could cost in the future). There goes the value of maternity/paternity leave.

I know benefits were critical for the last generation, but my generation is buried under so much BS that it feels like just another way for people to get out of paying us fair wages. The fact that benefits are advertised as a way to measure how much a company cares for its employees is a joke at this point.

It all sounds stupid as I write it, but can someone tell me if I'm an idiot or if I'm seeing sense? Please don't explain like I'm an expert or like I'm 5, but at a level a typical young professional could understand. I know many of these views reek of liberal bias, but I'll take the hard truth wherever it comes from. Thanks a lot in advance.",j413zp,"Let's say, hypothetically, the stock market increases on average 7% per year.  This is a really conservative estimate.  10% would be likely more accurate.

7% growth doubles every 10 years or so.  In 40 years, you'll have 16 dollars per every dollar you invest today.  Inflation will have roughly halved the value of money, so the value of your money will be roughly 8 times what you put in now.

I shouldn't be shamed for giving up on finding love,"let me paint you a picture. There's a district of the town you live in that's an absolute warzone, the most dangerous goddamn place you know of. And yet, when you tell people you give the violence district a wide berth, they look at you like you have 3 heads. What do you mean I drove through there the other day and saw children skipping and dogs playing. I went there last year, and left missing my wallet and a not insignificant amount of blood. Are we talking about the same place?

&amp;#x200B;

Point on a map, of course we are. I ask another friend who lives there and he says it's prime real estate, the view from my penthouse is spectacular. I walked down one of those streets and saw diapidated tenements, boarded up shops and burning trashcans tended by stabby hobos.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have to scratch my head, why does everyone seem determined to get me to move to the violence district when I know that only shankings await? I tell them this and they say that only one or two backstreets are like that, the rest is fine. But I've been mugged, beaten up and made to feel scared and anxious on every single occasion, why in the hell would I want anything to do with that godforsaken place?

&amp;#x200B;

Now we collapse the metaphor, substitute the Violence District for love, and it's streets for relationships. If my experience has been nothing but negative, and I bear scars from having been there, is it not the most base of all instincts to avoid things that cause me pain? Maybe you found the mythical promised land. Grand, happy for you. So riddle me this, why should I brave those streets if the one i'm living on now is sufficient?

&amp;#x200B;

(yes this is metaphor heavy, but it's honestly the best, most condensed way of explaining this)",smboyt,"No one should be *shamed* for a decision that harms no one else, but...

&gt; why should I brave those streets if the one i'm living on now is sufficient?

The street you're living on *isn't* sufficient for most people in the long run, and people who have your well-being in mind know that avoiding it because of past difficulties isn't usually a healthy response.  Their approach to this, again, shouldn't be shame, but when a friend is unreasonably avoiding something important, it's reasonable to give them a nudge now and again.

Of course, that has a couple of assumptions built into it.  It's entirely possible that you are genuinely among the exceptions who actually don't have any particular need for romance; it's entirely possible that the pressure you're evidently getting is beyond what's reasonable and appropriate for a friend concerned about a friend's well-being to exert; and it's entirely possible that it isn't coming from people concerned with your well-being, but just social-convention shaming.

But if all three assumptions do hold?  Then part of a genuine friend's role is to help you grow--and that means pushing you (not shaming you) to get out of your comfort zone where it's healthy to do so.  Most people do benefit from having a healthy romantic relationship established, but it's all too easy to fall into a tolerable but ultimately suboptimal comfort zone when you've been burned a few times.",hvvo9dk,4.0
"""PUA"" and ""Game"" aren't that bad and are no worse than female dating strategies.","I'm an Autist (diagnosed by a real world medical expert, not google and tumblr) and whilst I'd spent almost 2 decades working on social skills both in school/college and after, was an incredibly late bloomer (midway through 24), and strongly believe I would still be blooming today if it wasn't for what I learnt from a few PUA channels on youtube. Ultimately, It confirmed something to me that I'd known deep down all along: that casual sex wasn't for me, to steal a term I've heard from a wonderful channel on youtube, it felt to me like ""Masturbating with someone elses body""

I'm yet to see a convincing argument from anyone about PUA that doesn't apply exactly to things women do. The two main complaints I see are the following: ""It's lying and deceiving"" or ""It's psychological manipulation"".

""It's lying and deceiving"" - First of all I personally never once lied about my intentions, I was explicitly clear when asked of my intentions that it's just casual for now and the most deceptive thing I did was describe my job of welding as ""Engineering"" on tinder, which isn't even inaccurate as it's a subset of Engineering and my college certificates all say Engineering on them. For sure there's a perception that ""Engineer"" means ""more money"" than ""welder"", but if they're not gold digging then that's all irrelivent.

Secondly, don't even try telling me makeup isn't cheating or deceiving- I've seen before/after makeup photos of women taking 20 years off of themselves or going from... I'm going to be polite and say ""Someone I wouldn't look at twice"" to actual supermodel beauty.  Oh, and then there's plastic surgery, which is the most disingenuous of all and is predominantly the domain of females, (Per stats provided by the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, the most popular surgery for women was ""Breast Enlargement"", with almost 8000 women having it, almost 4x the amount of the top 5 surgeries men had- COMBINED (at under 2000), infact even the 5th most popular for women had more recipients than the top 5 for men combined - Source: [https://www.statista.com/chart/18071/most-popular-plastic-surgery-uk/](https://www.statista.com/chart/18071/most-popular-plastic-surgery-uk/))

""It's psychological manipulation"" - Again, how is it worse than makeup or a lowcut top/dress. Red lipstick / nailpaint doesn't work on me (frankly a massive turn off), but on average, most men seem find women with red lipstick/nail paint/rouge more attractive and it seems to be working on lines of evolutionary biology by giving off signals of fertility and arousal. Can't find any hard science or numbers on this, but then again, when can we find hard evidence in soft science, though there is this post on PsychologyToday by a trained psychologist which does cite studies (although not hyperlink to them, and frankly I don't actually care enough to go dig out all of these individual studies and read them 3 times to ensure I'm understanding them): [https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/meet-catch-and-keep/201502/5-research-backed-reasons-we-wear-makeup](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/meet-catch-and-keep/201502/5-research-backed-reasons-we-wear-makeup)

As for the the latter, I don't think theres anyone on earth who would deny that a low cut top/dress is going to to do certain things to the average heterosexual males psychology.

I'm sure there's some bad eggs in the PUA/Game communities teaching some shady shit that's going to catch some people a case, but I never witnessed it 4-5 years ago and given I confirmed that casual isn't for me at all, I've not even viewed those communities since then. Overall I think they're a net benefit, with some useful tools that I'll no doubt employ when finding someone to settle down with and that most of the hatred towards them comes from the sociopolitical climate at the moment.

With all that said. Change my view.",tgwefu,"Something that might be worth doing is looking at PUA behaviours outside of a romantic context. For example, a lot of women will put on makeup to hang out with their friends, without there being any men present, and generally don't perceive wearing makeup as lying to each other. However, something like negging (backhanded compliments designed to make a person want to please you) in a gender-segregated group would generally be perceived as bullying.

"Ignoring nuclear energy is a big middle finger for the planet and experts on the field, while making climate change not look like a crisis at all.","The  fight against Green House Emissions is focused on one big  transformation: the Energy sector, whose trending solution of the  present is to use renewable energy to eletrify everything we can, and to  produce hydrogen with everything we can't eletrify. (Biofuels for  extreme scenarios).

While trying  to achieve such goals, our natural gas consumption is rising, since it's  a perfect fit for the variability of Renewable Energy.

Meanwhile,  most countries ditch on nuclear energy, which is the perfect  replacement for coal power plants. Discussions surrounding it tend to  compare it with Variable Renewable Energy (VRE), and tend to be biased.

Statements  of ""solar and wind are cheaper than gas at the moment!"" are common, and  unfair, since they do not account with long-term storage any time, and  makes a bad comparison against any type of established energy.

This  further increased when nuclear's main problem are costs, which is a  very respected argument. Yes, while gas is truly cheaper than nuclear,  and, although it emits GHG, it can provide everything nuclear can  (energy-wise), but VRE alone cannot. On top of this, the decomission of  solar and wind is rarely put into consideration. These include  unrecyclable blades and foundations of concrete that are not removed  from the environment, and solar's toxic electronics that can be more  dangerous than nuclear waste. They also come with big, ignored costs,  while nuclear energy takes it into account.

The  worst is the hype surrounding hydrogen. If it ever comes to reality, it  doesn't become only a storage solution: it becomes a necessity for  transport and / or heat. As such, this necessity cannot be based only on  the excess of VRE. So, again, we will be dependant on the most  available process: steam reforming Natural Gas. The funny thing is that  even here nuclear can help, as itsresidual heat is a free source of  energy to produce hydrogen, which usually is dissipated into the water,  going to waste.

I am not saying  nuclear is asolution of everything, but it's a damn good, proven help.  Economics constraints should not be a reason alone to not adopt it. This  energy density would allow us to further evolve ourselves, and there  are tons of things humans put money on for the betterment of humankind,  such as space exploration.

People  mention Chernobyl, but this was one in a kind accident, almost half a  century ago, and experts did tons of work for the betterment of the  technology. Meanwhile, a Banqiao dam breaks in China, kills several  hundred thousand on people, while putting MILLIONS without home and  eletricity, but no-one is scared of them. Because they do not fear it.  They can't even imagine it happening to them.

Every  technology has problems that can be improved and bettered, and plenty of motivated people are working on making it better, cheaper, safer. But it seems that we live in a moment where supporting Renewable Energy and ditching  everything else is the ""good thing"" to do, even if that is actually  making our progress slower in the fight against climate change.

People  fear the complexity of nuclear energy, such as they fear more airplanes  than cars, although everyone knows that cars kill way more persons than  airplanes ever did. Nuclear is the ""Shrek"" that the city is afraid of,  even if he does save the princess at the end.

As long as this fear of a clean, dense and well-established technology,  and disregard of decades of hard-work done from highly inteligent  people, are we really allowed to say that we are facing a climate-change  **crisis?**

While the failure and subsequent destruction of lives is not theoretical (anecdotes, family law cases, etc.), the failure to reform the laws required to get legally married suggests either lack of activism, or my conspiracy theory - that too many people benefit economically from marriages and failed marriages (wedding industry through the separation of one home into two) to disrupt the status quo.

"If you believe a boyfriend/husband has no say in an abortion, than it is hypocritical to not support paper abortion.","I just want to preface this topic with a few points about my personal beliefs that are relevant. While I consider myself Pro-Life I do not think widespread illegal abortion is a practical solution, rather I think we should have more support to limit abortions (more care for single mothers, contraceptive access etc.). I also think that if (as a man) you get someone pregnant whether it is a hookup or a serious relationship, it is your responsibility to care for your child and their mother, and anything less is deplorable. 

That being said I don’t want this to be an abortion argument, I am simply talking about the idea that within a relationship, the man has no say if the women gets an abortion which seems to be a major talking point of pro-choice crowds.  I want to be clear, I’m not advocating that a woman should need her boyfriends permission to get an abortion, however I think in the scope of a healthy relationship the mans opinion does matter and holds equal weight to the woman’s. 

Of course this is a nuanced issue as a pregnancy and a child effect the woman more, however I believe in a mature relationship the man should be able to pick up the slack to support his girlfriend in the pregnancy. 

This brings me to my main point which is that if you hold the opinion the man should have no say in the pregnancy of his S/O, than he should also have the right to a paper abortion otherwise the point is hypocritical. 

I would like to point out again, I am not advocating for paper abortion as a policy, I find it abhorrent, but I believe if you think a man should have no say in his partner getting an abortion than he should not be forced to give financial support for a child he did not want.",gqf338,"What's hypocritical?

Impeachment/25th amendment are the only real checks on the Executive Branch,"The president can do whatever the hell they want, and there is nothing that Congress can do to make them stop outside of impeachment. 

Every employee of the Federal Government works for the President, and, even if they don't, the president can run their sector of the federal government out of the West Wing. As a result, the president can order their employees to break federal law, and fire them should they refuse. Eventually, you'll reach an employee who will enforce the will of the Executive.

The military, for example, the President can just fire their top commanders if they have moral or legal objections to actions. Their newly promoted subordinate won't have those objections. 

Lets say the Supreme Court tells the executive to halt a deportation. The president orders the ICE agent to continue. The ICE agent refuses. The president moves that particular ICE agent to a different case. A new sympathetic ICE agent is placed on the original case. The deportation continues.

The deportation occurs and the Supreme Court has no recourse. The House has no recourse.

But what about pay you say? The House controls the purse strings!!!!!

The House refuses to approve more spending/borrowing and the government should shut down. The president orders the Treasury secretary to issue bonds. The Treasury secretary refuses. The president fires him and asks the new acting Treasury secretary to issue bonds. The new secretary does so and pays federal employees. Every employee is ordered to come to work.

Abortion is moral because of lack of sentience and therefore lack of desires,"I know abortion posts are probably fairly common, but my point here is one I haven't seen specifically addressed. 

On a legal and practical level I think you can make strong arguments for the pro-choice position pretty close to the point of birth. However I do also think the moral position is very justifiable, at least for part of the pregnancy. 

Here are three points: 

Point a) Currently conscious and experiencing sentience

Point b) Will at some point in the future be conscious and experience sentience

Point c) At some point in the past been conscious and experienced sentience

Now I believe it is immoral to kill a being that falls under point a), however I don't think either b) or c) *on their own* mean it would be immoral to kill. I think you need *both* of them. As if someone doesn't know they will ever experience consciousness, then you aren't taking away anything form them by killing them, as they had no desires (to be clear a ""desire"" is literally anything that a person could expect/want. I don't mean grand desires like ""I want to be rich"". Just any expectation that you will still be conscious tomorrow could be classed as a ""desire""), and if they can't ever be conscious again, you aren't taking experience away by killing them, they already had 0 potential for future experience. Some examples: 

1) A ""braindead"" person who will never wake up, only being kept alive by machines. - I don't think it is immoral to kill this person, they are not conscious, and never will be again. You are not taking experience that they may have desired away from them. 

2) A sleeping person - I believe it is immoral to kill a sleeping person, as, even though they are not currently a), they are b) **and** c). They have desires, as they have been conscious in the past, and, all else equal, will be conscious in the future. 

3) A Fetus (before 18 weeks or whenever consciousness begins) - I don't believe killing this being would be immoral, they don't have desires, therefore by killing them you are not taking away their desires. The fact they will have desires in the future is irrelevant, as they don't expect to have them. 

To be very clear about terms, by ""conscious and sentient"" I basically just mean has the ability to think and have desires, but is also aware.",nbk8bh,"Under your axioms (it's only immoral to kill someone that has experienced sentience and will experience it again), your logic is sound, even if many people will disagree with some of its implications.

However, these axioms are based on just what *you* feel - why would they hold universally, or, in fact, in what way is your argument more than a slight generalization, without external justification, of ""I feel that abortion is moral""?",gxzrxub,2.5
"It seems like ""Americans"" aren't allowed to criticize other countries.","This is a double standard that kind of urks me. I've seen countless times on the YouTube comments section where some ""american"" criticized or made of another country only to have some replies that talk about how ""America is worse or this is just like America"" and phrasing their comments as if the original poster has no room to talk. Of course, if you say something bad about America or American, it's more often not to people fine (Not to say that nobody will ever get offended this.) Reasons why I this isn't a good for someone to do this is:

1) it's a red herring fallacy and/or a tu quoqui . Just because America is objectively worse in this expect doesn't make this issue in another country any better. It's kinda childish at best and a deflection from a possibly valid criticism at worst. Even then, this ""American"" could be aware that America has the same issue that he/she is criticizing another for but America isn't the topic being discussed about. 

2) It's not always objective or true that America has this particular problem to the same extent of another country or worse than said country. It could be true not always. 

3) This is only works assuming the person making the criticism is American (which is why I put American under quotation marks in the title). Just because some is making an english comment or post ""arrogantly"" doesn't automatically mean they are American. They could be Canadian, British, or Australian. 

If you're curious:
This entire post spawned from a comment on an Ace Attorney video jokingly criticized Japan's justice system for being ""Guilty til proven innocent"". Instead of  debunking or challenging this comment, someone replied with ""like US sh***ier versión (or something like that).

being a conservative is the least Christ-like political view,"From what I know, Christ was essentially a radical leftist. He was all about helping and loving the poor, hungry, disabled, outcast. He would feed 10 people just in case one was going hungry. He flipped a table when banks were trying to take advantage of people. He was anti-capitalist and pro social responsibility to support, love and respect all members of society. He was, based on location and era, probably a person of color. He would not stand for discrimination. He would overthrow an institution that treated people like crap.

On the other hand, conservatives are all about greed. They are not willing to help people in need (through governmental means) because they “didn’t earn it” and it’s “my tax dollars”. They are very pro-capitalism, and would let 10 people go hungry because one might not actually need the help. They do not believe in social responsibility, instead they prioritize the individual. Very dog eat dog world to them. And, while there are conservatives of color, in America most conservatives are at least a little bit racist (intentionally or not) because most do not recognize how racism can be institutional and generational. They think everyone has the same opportunities and you can just magically work your way out of poverty. 

Christ would be a radical leftist and conservatism is about as far as you can get from being Christ-like in politics. The Bible says nothing about abortion (it actually basically only says if someone makes a pregnant woman lose her baby, they have to pay the husband). It does not say homosexuality is sin, just that a man should not lie with a boy (basically, anti pedophilia) based on new translations not run through the filter of King James. Other arguments are based on Old Testament, which is not what Christianity focuses on. Jesus said forget that, listen to me (enter Christianity). Essentially all conservative arguments using the Bible are shaky at best. And if you just look at the overall message of Jesus, he would disagree with conservatives on almost everything.

EDIT: Wow, this is blowing up. I tried to respond to a lot of people. I tried to keep my post open (saying left instead of Democrat, saying Christian instead of Baptist or Protestant) to encourage more discussion on the differences between subgroups. It was not my intent to lump groups together.

Of course I am not the #1 most educated person in the world on these issues. I posted my opinion, which as a human, is of course flawed and even sometimes uninformed. I appreciate everyone who commented kindly, even if it was in disagreement.

I think this is a really interesting discussion and I genuinely enjoy hearing all the points of view. I’m trying to be more open minded about how conservative Christians can have the views they have, as from my irreligious upbringing, it seemed contradictory. I’ve learned a lot today!

I still think some conservatives do not live or operate in a Christ-like manner and yet thump the Bible to make political points, which is frustrating and the original inspiration for this point. However I now understand that that is not ALWAYS the case.",kvwbxj,"You're quite incorrect on your views of conservative people.

Let me explain: 
""MY tax dollar"" yes, here we don't mind taxes because it's mostly spent towards helping other people AND improving the life standard. Europe doesn't spend ridiculous amounts of money on military like the us does, that's why we have FREE healthcare  FREE education at all levels and the BEST universities and colleges ARE FREE. 
But people care about their money, and get very fucking upset when the taxes go towards things that dont bring any good. 


Also countries in Europe are very good at helping people who are financially fucked but still wanna contribute to society. As the government won't let you starve here and WILL raise you to at least middle/lower class IF YOU DO NOT STARTTAKING DRUGS AND DRINKING OUT OF THE NORM. That's why conservatives here hate the homeless, because they're lazy and don't need help. Those who got in a sticky situation and NEED help and WANT to work themselves back to the norm, the govt will give tax money to help. 


It's that easy. Take a look around the world.",gj45hqi,4.5
There is no such thing as objectively “good” or “evil”.,"I was watching a Michael Knowles video on YouTube where he said “taking your kids to church is ‘objectively good’”and “encouraging your kids to be transgender is ‘objectively evil’”. 

This is just an example but it got me thinking how much I disagree with the premise of something being objectively good or evil. To label anything with these two adjectives seems to only amount to a conjecture, something subjective, not anything factual. 

As I understand, the definition of objective would mean that it remains true no matter who you talk to. To be “objectively good” or “objectively evil” it cannot involve feelings or opinions, and must represent facts. 

I’m looking to see if anyone can change my view on this.

EDIT: Mind changed, because I cannot prove that there isn’t an ultimate standard for good or evil.",k5g5wr,"Good and evil have different definitions depending on culture. However, once you have established what constitutes good and evil, you can objectively measure actions accordingly.

obejectively evil according to that particular set of morality.",geenjmf,3.2
"changing your gender, either physically or otherwise, is conforming/accepting conservative roles and accepting that to be X you must be X","To enjoy, partake and do specific things means you must be the conformist version of that thing.

They are accepting and conforming to the social constructs that they are supposed to fight against.

you can be a hairy man who likes to wear dresses, wear makeup, etc. you don't need to feel like a female, because your ""feeling"" like a female is a constructed view of what a female is.

Edit: people are disregarding the point. The point is gender should not be its own thing as it's only an idea of personality created from generations of norms and roles. All dysphoria is a fundamental belief that men mean this and women mean that. If you can separate biological function from made up human words, you can accept who you are and do whatever you choose. Making gender a thing is hindering true human progress.

"the, “____ is a social construct” statement is dumb…","Literally everything humans use is a “social construct”.  If we invented it, it means it does not exist in nature and therefore was constructed by us.

You have to get people to acknowledge that we don't have to do things the way we're currently doing them before you can convince them to change anything.

The kind of argument you're talking about has 2 major weakness that I see:

1. It's cliche and people tune it out (just like you said)
2. It's only the beginning of an argument. It's not a solution, it's just a reminder that change is an option.

So maybe this exact kind of wording and delivery is ineffective, but you can't make things happen without using this line of reasoning to some degree just so you can pave the way for whatever the better ""social construct"" solution might be.

"If a candidate has the qualifications to be president, especially over their opponent, they shouldn’t have to be super likeable/charismatic for people to vote for them. It should be obvious that they are the best choice.","I personally know a lot of people who didn’t vote this year because they didn’t like Biden or Trump. I could totally understand not voting for Trump, but I didn’t understand not voting for Biden. Whenever I pointed out that Biden served as a senator for almost 40 years and as a Vice President for 8, they would agree that he was more qualified than Trump but say they still didn’t “feel a connection” with him so refused to vote for him. They also didn’t care that he was apart of an administration that helped America recover from a recession, beat Swine flu relatively quickly and stopped Ebola from spreading, problems similar to what we are experiencing right now. I just don’t understand how you can know someone is more experienced and qualified to literally be the head of state and still not vote for them because you don’t feel a personal connection with them.

Another example of this is Hillary Clinton. Clinton was an abnormally hated candidate. Despite being one of the most qualified people to ever run for office, millions of people still couldn’t bring themselves to vote for her just because they didn’t like her. As a result, she lost to aa man with no prior experience in politics. I know at least ten people who hated her and didn’t vote for her/voted third party who were in tears when she lost and went to protests against trumps win.

Fiction is better than reality," 

1. Fiction uses metaphors to reach truths that are beyond language's capabilities.
2. Fiction can create infinite connections that include all of reality and much more.
3. Fiction can speculate the future.

Your youth degrades with every passing second and you can never get it back.

The moment you were born, you have a ticking clock that no one, not even you, can observe, that knows exactly when you will die.

You, and everyone else, has limitations that logic, physics and the very nature of reality refuses to let you surpass.

There   are millions of people who hope to become a singer, dancer, athlete,   actor or even something less glamorous but equally fulfilling like a   successful business owner, a published author, a news anchor, etc.

Reality   has boundaries, laws, restrictions and limitations that, no matter  what  advancements are made, are impossible to surpass. This leads to   an  acceptance of insatiability, disappointment and unfulfilled desires.

Failing   to be a ballet dancer because of a car accident that paralyzed you  from  the neck down. No regenerative powers you can just inhabit or  enact. No  Android body you can transfer yourself into. No. It's gone.

Never being able to fly through the sky at sunrise with the birds.

Never   being able to bring your loved one back to life who was wrongfully   killed. Even when they're inches away from you. No Phoenix Downs there.

Reality, once all avenues are explored and thought about or even known about, is often disappointing.

But   what if you could have programs like the ones in Overlord? Or an even   better version that would make you the authority of your own reality,   one that harmed no one and created whatever you wanted, whether it was   no limitations of simply an adjustment of those limitations?

Virtual Reality programs that could flawlessly recreate fiction to overlap and overtake reality.

Unfortunately,   not only would such technology be possible but, even IF something like   that were to be developed for usage, the public would never be able to   experience it. Reality limits us.

From   having superpowers to bringing back loved ones to going on a dungeon   raid will all be impossible dreams that will be there as ephemeral   pleasantries in fiction that reality will never allow for us to actually   experience.

And as every year   passes, we have to come to accept that a lot of what we want will never   be. You won't have the lover you dreamed of or that perfect job.

Fiction   and its worlds are better than reality in terms of satisfaction,   freedom, creativity and indulgence. No amount of alcohol and drugs can   overcome a limitless amount of worlds we will forever be locked out of.

The international community should cut all ties with China until they stop the mass genocide of Uighur Muslims,"It’s inexcusable that the vast majority of the world still maintains ties with China as they do the worst mass genocide since the Holocaust, and the only mass genocide that can compare to it. China needs to be held accountable and we need to send the message that this isn’t ok. The best way to do so is to cut all ties, including trade and diplomatic relations, until China halts this mass genocide. Women are being raped to death. Men and children are being worked to death. People are being sterilized. You can’t sit by and allow this to happen.

The negative consequences that I can see happening is we lose (in a short period of time) a lot of exports, but I’m sure we can all agree that we can wait a year for a new iphone if it leads to the end of a mass genocide. We can trade in other places. We should do anything we can to stop this human rights violation, and it starts with cutting ties to China.

Planned obsolescence is the same as deliberately selling a defective product and the timeframe should be disclosed to the purchaser.," Firstly, planned obsolescence is different to using poor quality components materials for cost saving. Planned obsolescence (P.O) is deliberately including design flaws to ensure a product stops working or has reduced performance after a certain amount of time. It does not include items that need to stop working for safety reasons such as an expired gas detector.

 As an example, there are two very similar phones that cost $500 each, one has a P.O date of 2 years, and the other has a P.O date of 5 years.  As each phone gets nearer to it’s P.O date it’s value approaches zero, so after 1 year the first phone is worth less than the second. The second phone represents a better investment. 

It’s not possible for consumers to make the best decision for their financial circumstances without knowing the P.O date and the manufacturer should have to disclose it.",nev5mz,"It's not necessarily that items are planned to fail at x, but are designed to last at least until x.

Everyone and anyone is worthy of being forgiven. Even if they have done horrible things in their past or even have bad intentions for the future.,"In this world we often find a way of finding any random or specific reason to hate others or even go as far as to justify the desire for their life to be taken, but read me out (because this is text and you can't hear me out... moving on) No matter what or who you may think of in this world that you believe isn't worthy of your forgiveness including murderers or cheaters for example... These people are all people, just like you and I. Now this isn't me saying I will forgive and happily befriend these types of people just because they are people,  because I do acknowledge the fact that their horrible acts and lives they have negatively effected are horrendous. 

I like to look at it like this, we all came into this world the same way (unless you were developed in one of those artificial pregnancies in some machine) no but really, we all came into this world as human beings, and we all had our own personal share of experiences in the world and what it had to give to us specifically. Depending on what the world threw at us, we all reacted to it differently, some of us came into the world without/ a lack of things, others with more than enough, some of us suffered biological impairments coming into this world which one could deem as ""unfair""; the first major lesson the world likes to teach us all before we even know what a lesson is. So I'm getting all washy and holistic here but stay with me. When you consider this, you realise that we all start at square one and build up in different and sometimes distorted directions. We all ""sin"" and disappoint/ hurt people. So when you level this understanding, it's easier to look at these people that are fairly and rightfully deemed as bad people in more of an understanding and reflective perspective. 

When you consider the fact that we are all the same in some way, you begin to see yourself in others, sometimes it's a part of you that you like, other times it's a part of you that you hate and would rather forget. But when you start to view people as individuals in this way as opposed to them ""just being that way"" you build this authentic understanding, and it becomes easier to not just choose to forgive them but acknowledge that they slipped up in this life, you know? The wrong things happened at the wrong time or their minds developed in the wrong way. But I just struggle to hate and condemn these people, I just feel sorry for them. Maybe this is how Jesus chooses to forgive others with this somewhat being in mind, us all being his family regardless if we disappoint. To not forgive and Cary hatred like this  is a heavy burden to carry on our hearts, and in my opinion, it does a person no good on the long run, it'll just run you down.

But anyway, please do let me know your views on the matter I'm super curious to read what y'all have to say.

Social media moderation should be done by the judicial system,"*This is not a view about whether moderation should exist or not, it's about who does it*

In the last century, we came to the agreement that freedom of speech is one of our most important freedoms. And we create laws to protect it: you can't force a newspaper to not talk about a subject, you can't forbid someone to talk about something, express their opinions or their point of view. Each country have their own vision of what falls under free speech, but it seems we have reached a global agreement: unless the tribunal says otherwise, you're free to express your views.

Tribunals can block some content, usually on the following basis: Harmful to national security, to minors, copyrighted content, ... It is important to note here that I'm assuming your justice is independent, otherwise you have a bigger problem than social networks moderation

&amp;#x200B;

For the last 10 years, free speech has changed a bit: we express our opinions mainly by privately own platforms: Facebook/Twitter/Instagram/Reddit. Even journalists and politicians communicate mainly trough them, just look at the fuss produced by Trump's Twitter account. This poses a new free speech problem: if my opponent and I have the same right to free speech, but I can only express in my local newspapers while he can on Twitter, are we really equally allowed to practice free speech ? I don't think so, which means that even if my opponent and I are both equal in the eyes of the law, we are still dependent on the equality given by those companies.

Zuckerberg recently pushed for the idea of an ""Oversight Board"", where you could appeal the decisions made by moderators if you disagree with them. While the idea might sound appealing, Zuckerberg is pushing for a duplicate of the judicial system, privately owned and dedicated to social network moderation.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's my opinion: Social Media content should be moderated by the judicial system. I'm not talking about every message posted on your old local forum, but content on the top social networks, where being censured is way more problematic, maybe social networks with more than 100 millions users ?

How would it work ?

\- Financed by taxes on the companies themselves: they're already paying for their moderators, the difference would be that the money comes from a tax-like system, so that no pressure can be put on the moderators themselves

\- We don't need a judge in a black dress and in a court overseeing this: a person with a law degree, or even a special certification would suffice, as long as they know about the specific laws, and are given enough impartiality

\- No need to moderate every content: only content flagged by users, or autonomous systems could be reviewed

\- Actual system sucks for moderators: low-pay, difficult content, ... Managing them by a public system would allow to work without looking for profit at all costs

From the answers I received, there seems to be a few things I misexplained:

\- **I don't want to block moderation for unlimited free speech,** I just don't think it should be handled by private companies, who could technically ban you if they disagree with you. This is not a view about whether moderation should exist or not, it's about who does it

\- **I don't want to give moderation powers to the government:** Justice and Executive are two distinct entities in democracies, Judges don't take orders from the Executive, are independent and impartial, which is why they are already in charge of issuing arrest warrants, deciding whether or not to jail people, ...

I'm really interested in hearing thoughts about this, please don't hesitate to correct my English as I'm non-native",f78nj0,"So I have two main issues with this. 

1) social media shouldn’t moderate speech anyway. In the eyes of the law, there are differences between publishers and platforms, with social media being considered the latter. Therefore, social media should only censor ILLEGAL content. If they remove things because they are ‘harmful’ which is very subjective, they potentially move into the realms of publisher which means they should be treated as such (I believe some things are different depending on which you are considered to be). 

2) if the judicial system say what should be moderated, the list will be vague. For example, hate speech. Hate speech is subjective, whilst some is clearly hate speech, other times, it’s just someone’s feelings got hurt or an expression of an unpopular opinion. So by what would be a vague set or criteria, it gives social media companies the legal authority to censor more ‘harmful’ content without the risk of loosing their ‘platform’ status and associated benefits, which I am slightly sceptical that, that’s what’s going on with these suggestions lately.",fiavl6a,3.25
Androids in Detroit:Become Human are not alive,"I played this game a few days ago and I hold the belief that Androids should not be given the status of a living being and/or should not be granted any rights. My reasons are as follows -



1) They are human made in labs from scratch. They don't occur in nature.


2) If some rewiring is done or some components are removed from them, they will become emotionless no matter how much one tries to ""Awaken"" them. This is based on the fact that a certain amount of advancement (technologically) is needed in that android for it to have all the things it's needs to Awaken. Otherwise, they're just as inanimate or lifeless as a toaster, and no one can Awaken a toaster.


3) Yes, Androids can die and their memories can be formatted, which is seen in other living beings too, but they can also upload their memories in its entirety to another server and if at all they ""die"" they can be brought back to life via fixing. That cannot be done to any other living being.




For the time being, these are my reasons, if I get some comments, I will clarify further if needed.

"Using only toilet paper to wipe yourself clean is incredibly unhygienic, and using water/wiping solutions is pretty much a requirement.","Perhaps it’s the culture I was raised in, but my whole life here after going #2, cleaning up afterwards always goes something like this

Spray water using the provided hose (one that doesn’t seem to exist in most countries), while washing out your bottom thoroughly using your hand. After it’s been cleaned, dry using toilet paper thoroughly as to not leave any moisture behind. Then, wash your hands. Washing hands prior to even going to the toilet may be required at times, as to not touch your anus with some bacteria you’ve been lugging around on your fingers.


A lot of people might already be repulsed after reading that, the idea of directly washing your poop stained butt with your hand. I’ve had many discussions about this with foreign online friends and they all thought this was disgusting. I personally don’t see how this could be an issue if you wash your hands properly after. If it’s such a big problem, then you can also just spray water all around, and dry it out with toilet paper whilst also picking out residual feces with it.


Cleaning out your butt with just plain toilet paper does not work. It’s practically impossible to thoroughly clean and dry your butt with just toilet paper, not to mention the fact that you have to use way more TP with this method than with the water method. Wet wipes may be a decent solution for this as well but I am not familiar with those as of now. 


Some of my friends argue that with your daily shower does your butt truly become cleaned out, and that throughout the day it’s at a very acceptable level. I personally don’t think that’s true at all, both methods do not address the issue of bacteria as no soap is used in either, but the TP only method definitely leaves behind way more bacteria with the fact that it leaves behind very miniscule amounts of feces. Additionally, I doubt that the people who find the idea of cleaning out their butts with their hands disgusting would even proceed to clean it properly in the shower either.

"In ""The Temptation of St. Anthony"" by Dalí, the third elephant only has two legs. Furthermore, I believe this is not on purpose; Dalí simply forgot them. Change My View.","So as the title says, I am stating that the third elephant in the painting ""[The Temptation of St. Anthony"" by Salvador ](https://i.imgur.com/GuBndSt.jpg)[Dalí](https://i.imgur.com/GuBndSt.jpg)[ ](https://i.imgur.com/GuBndSt.jpg)[(with edit)](https://i.imgur.com/GuBndSt.jpg)   in 1946 only has it's two front legs.

There are no hind legs painted for this elephant, and [I have added to the left picture the contours of the first three elephants each filled in with a different color to emphasize my point](https://i.imgur.com/GuBndSt.jpg).

I believe that this is a mistake by the artist and NOT on purpose.

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, I really don't *expect* my view to be changed but I would be amazed if anyone can convincingly argue how this is either not the case, or indeed on purpose.

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate Dalí was a master painter and one of the greatest in his field, but also, he, like anyone, was inherently human and therefore as able as anyone to make mistakes, overlook or simply forget stuff. So arguments in the line of ""you can't know what he meant"" or ""he was one of the greatest painters therefore he would not have made such a mistake"" or similar probably won't convince me much.

&amp;#x200B;

At some point while visiting the Dalí museum, I had the chance to talk to one of the curators/employees and asked them about the missing legs. They didn't have this particular painting in their collection but they had a collection of books on Dalí throughout the exhibition to accompany the displayed works. They said they didn't understand what painting I meant, so I showed them in one of these books. They looked stunned for a moment and then tried correcting me by pointing at the legs of one of the other elephants, and every time I followed the direction of one of those legs to show they in fact did not belong to the third elephant, they would point to another leg and so forth until I gave up.

They would not have it.

&amp;#x200B;

Even with the obvious focus on legs in this painting, I can't find any mention of the missing legs online, there's nothing about it on the wiki page or on it's page on [dali.com](https://dali.com/temptation-st-anthony-perennial-favorite-among-dali-fans/), no book articles, nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Examining the painting, we see the third elephant's rear is obscured by the fourth elephant, preventing the viewer to see the start of it's rear legs. Had it had legs, they would presumably come into view somewhere beneath number four's belly or behind number four's front legs Yet we only see some material hanging from number four's belly and a yellow glow. I don't think these hanging shapes have anything to do with the missing legs, as there is similar stuff hanging from number three's trunk and the horse's front feet. Also the last elephant in the distance is painted from nearly the same angle and it's belly and hind legs shape are clearly similar.

The argument that Dalí might have found this area too crowded and therefore used the yellow glow / sunlight to hide the missing legs to keep the composition clear is not convincing to me, because even if so, the missing legs should come into view beneath the clouds where there is more than enough room for them.

auce belongs in the cupboard not the fridge.," If you put your sauce in the fridge, you disgust me. I’m joking, but as a true Aussie through and through, I strongly believe that sauce belongs in the cupboard, here’s why:

Side note: When I say sauce, I mean store bought, tomato sauce, bbq sauce or mustard.

1. Why would you ever want cold sauce, with a warm sausage, meat pie, steak. Take your pick. It’s a mix of different temperatures that ruin the flavour in my opinion. But with the sauce in the cupboard. It’s at room temperature, your problem is solved.

2. No one likes having to squeeze as hard as they can to get the sauce out of the bottle, but if you put your sauce in the fridge, this is what happens. Your sauce freezes smh. 

3. Sauce has enough preservatives to keep it in the cupboard anyway. All you bloody people saying it’s unhealthy. Your wrong. I’ve done it for years and I’m perfectly fine.

"The idea that the unvaccinated are ‘taking up beds’, or undeserving of care is wrong and a profound perversion of liberal values, progressivism, and the antithesis of the compassionate goals of modern healthcare","So upfront, I’m an ICU nurse, about ten years into the career.  I’ve worked only in the United States, but have worked in 5 or 6 different states, East to West coast, and the brunt of that has been in Western moderately to overwhelmingly ‘progressive’ large cities.  

Things to get out of the way: I’m vaccinated, I believe the vaccine is scientifically an incredible achievement, safe, and generally everyone who can get it should get it, certainly anyone with any dangerous comorbidities like HTN, obesity, or DM.  This isn’t a discussion about vaccine efficacy.

During the pandemic, specifically the delta waves in late 2020-early 2021, the ICU units I was working on were alternating between waves of dying COVID patients, almost entirely unvaccinated, and being filled with severe end stage alcohol abuse and IV drug use patients. At one point, in a weeks time we went from entirely full of COVID patients, to 100% full of alcohol abuse and withdrawal, suicide attempts, IVDU, and end stage lung disease from smoking, generally in addition to obesity, uncontrolled diabetes, etc.  These other conditions are not new, ICU’s have been this way for decades.  My coworkers were appalled, and the opinion was often that the unvaccinated were taking up ventilators and beds.  I couldn’t help but think; *what kind of supposedly liberal worldview would look down upon the group of people being literally slaughtered by an unprecedented airborne pandemic virus as unworthy of treatment and compassion?*. This concept has bothered me for over a year now, which is why I’m here.

The premise of my position: *healthcare resources since the inception of modern healthcare have been overwhelmingly skewed towards use by people of lower socioeconomic status and poor health illiteracy, and COVID is no different.*  This isn’t rocket science, people with less resources are chronically stressed, make worse health choices, and suffer from more chronic diseases than health literate, well off people.  They spend far more time sick in ICU’s than healthy people.  Robert Sapolsky did a lot of [great work](http://www.precaution.org/lib/05/sick_of_poverty.051215.pdf) on the subject, and “Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers” is an excellent read on the subject.

Not being vaccinated is correlated with being conservative politically, but far more concretely correlated with [being uneducated](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/12/who-are-the-adults-not-vaccinated-against-covid.html) or being [poor or marginalized](https://newrepublic.com/amp/article/163319/covid-vaccine-hesitancy-denial-misinformation-poverty).  *It is still to my knowledge profoundly illiberal to mistreat and look down upon uneducated, poor people in general.  In the setting of a global pandemic and an era of high government mistrust for these communities, acceptance of this view is absolutely embarrassing.*

Common argument I’ve heard and am entertaining; *the unvaccinated simply made one unacceptable behavioral/moral choice, the loads of other chronically ill morbidly obese, long term smokers, and general abusers of their health have biological predispositions for using healthcare resources;IE not their fault.*

Well, yes and no.  Behavioral science is a fascinating and evolving discipline that I’m not well versed in, but vaccine hesitancy seems to me to be an extremely arbitrary point to draw the line between victim and villain.  When a patient is hospitalized for a suicide attempt, we’re saddened that they stopped going to therapy or taking their antidepressants, but we don’t believe they’re taking up a hospital bed, or berating them for this poor choice.  When a patient decides to stop taking their prescribed diuretics, or skip dialysis and ends up on life support, knowing full well of the consequences (this happens *astonishingly* often), we don’t look down on them for it.  We treat them.

This argument is rooted in the idea that some types of people have diagnosed diseases and are incapable of being at fault or making decisions for themselves, but the unvaccinated are not privy to that status.  *This sort of implies to me that we believe smoking addiction or food addiction has biological/social causes and being unvaccinated does not, or that those causes are less justified.* My understanding of behavioral science and human nature is that these processes are more complex and assigning agency or lack thereof in a black and and white manner doesn’t seem beneficial.",sle03e,"Just to be clear, choosing to not get vaccinated for a non-medical reason is not on the same level as other ""unhealthy"" actions like smoking or being obese for one important reason. Except for second-hand smoke (which is situational), smoking and being obese aren't contagious. They don't directly affect the health and safety of others.  

The unvaccinated, however, substantially increase the spread of the virus. Biologically, the more a virus spreads, the more opportunities it has to evolve into new strains or variants. For this reason, unvaccinated people are also (somewhat ironically) a major contributing factor to breakthrough infections.  

Unvaccinated people bear disproportionate responsibility for the number of cases, the use of often scarce medical supplies and space, and for the development of new variants.",hvtm8pg,3.2
While it is entirely possible to be transgender. It is not possible to be on a non binary spectrum.,"I totally understand the concept of being transgender. Due to psychological and hormonal issues an individual may genuinely feel so deeply feminine or masculine that they are they are closer to the opposite gender than the one assigned at birth.

However, it simply doesn’t make since that a person can feel as though they are a gender completely outside of the masculine feminine range. I could maybe even understand a sort of “somewhere in between” gender (I don’t know what it’s called)  but I genuinely knew someone who seriously identified as a lamp. How can someone feel a certain way that is outside of the range of feminine to masculine. 

I don’t mean to attack anyone and I respect all people for their existence as human beings alone but I genuinely do not see how it can be physically possible to be something that doesn’t exist with in a humans realm of possibility.

Please CMV",crvxnj,"&gt; I could maybe even understand a sort of “somewhere in between” gender &lt;

Yeah that's non binary

&gt; an individual may genuinely feel so deeply feminine or masculine that they are they are closer to the opposite gender than the one assigned at birth. &lt;

Feeling more feminine or masculine doesn't make someone trans. Definitely not the case for tomboys and fem-men. Someone is trans if their gender identity is opposite from their assigned gender. It exists independent from gender expression.

&gt; I genuinely knew someone who seriously identified as a lamp. &lt;

How can a human identity as a lamp? Even if it's something like race, gender identity is different because gender identity is an innate biological identity. There's a natural mechanism in human brains to identify your gender.

There's a natural spectrum of sex in humans. This is because the biological processes that make a male and female don't go right all the time as is in natural systems which causes variation, it's what we recognize as Intersex and therefore sexes exist along a spectrum. Transgenderity can be seen as an Intersex condition, it's when the sex of your brain ( what we refer to as gender ) develops separate to your physical sex. A similar sex variation can be seen in brains and thus a gender spectrum can also be seen. This variation is why we have gender fluid, non binary and agender individuals.",exacdxv,2.0

My argument is just that suction, by its very definition, is a direct result of, and necessarily requires, at least a partial vacuum. Unless there's a way that I may not be aware of to create suction without a pressure differential.

That is exactly what they are trying to convey when they say it isn't sucking.  It is pushing, not pulling.  Suction implies pulling, which is an incorrect way to think about what is happening.  Saying ""it doesn't suck"" is a way in which to better describe and understand the mechanics of what is actually happening because, as you said, it is pushing, not pulling.

That of course leaves no definition for the word ""suction"" so it is the same type of semantics involved in saying, ""cold doesn't exist, it is just a lack of heat"".

England wasn't as bad as they are made out to be during the American Revolution,"Growing up in America, the British aren't always shown in the greatest of lights during their actions in the 18th century. However, there are a few things that are worth mentioning that may shift views of them in a way for two main reasons.

England whether they were truly serious about it or not were usually more anti-slavery than America was. While many Southern states refused to let blacks serve in the military, England said they would grant black slaves serve with them and grant their freedom at the end of the war. At the end of the war, when Loyalists were fleeing America in droves, British ships allowed escaped slaves to tag along and flee to other parts of the British Empire where more often than not, they were granted freedom.

Also, England seemed to be trying fairly hard to not screw over the Native Americans. In the Royal Proclamation of 1763, the English government outlawed settlement west of the Apalachian Mountains by colonists, protecting that land as an Indian Reserve, not to mention England was more successful in getting tribes to fight for their side than the American patriots could.

This is in response to another post, as I found that this was really the biggest issue with my view.  For those coming from that pose, hopefully this gives better context.

I have some close gay friends, so this is a concern for me as someone who has strong religious beliefs. I'm worried that if they were to ask me about my views and I told them, they would no longer want to be friends.  I think we should be able to be friends, but I get that it’s quite tricky since I’m basically admitting to thinking a major part of their lifestyle is wrong.

Christians (the real ones) don't hate people because they are trans or gay.  But I think the problem people have with Christians' view on this is that it is in a sense (or maybe completely) denying a trans person's chosen identity. I'm curious if it's possible for a Christian to hold the view that transgenderism is a sin without it upsetting or being problematic for trans people.

My main thought process through this is: what if my LGBTQ friend asked me what my view on it all was? What would my honest response be? And is there a way that we could still be friends afterward? This is my concern going in. I'm not trying to get rid of my LGBTQ friends, but I'm also not willing to lie about what I believe.

As a Christian, I don’t have a problem with being close friends with people within the LGBTQ community.  I don’t want to or plan to go around telling random people on the street my religious beliefs on the matter.  I think that’s unproductive and harmful because it’s not ever going to be seen as coming from a place of love or respect for them as a person.  Is that also going to have to be the case with my gay friends?

The science fiction ability to directly upload information to people’s brains would destroy society as we know it,"Just got done reading a post about Elon Musks new company which deals with brain implants which got me thinking about brain implants and technology to brain interfaces and I came up with the conclusion that it would transform society into something we cannot even begin to comprehend.

Let’s start with what that may look like. For this scenario we will assume everything goes absolutely perfectly as far as the technologies purpose. No such thing as “brain malware”, mind control, brain hacking, or some kind of dystopian development occurs, although this is a potential worry of mine as well. But for this scenario we will assume it does not happen. 

One of the main things determining income in our society currently is the level of education one obtains. This is due to the supply and demand. If you have a valuable skill set in a field that less people have the knowledge of, you will be paid more because someone needs you to do this job and there are not many candidates who can do it. Go to school longer and you get a better job, generally speaking (assuming it follows the supply and demand principle still).

Now imagine you can upload an entire education in seconds. Now anyone can be a doctor, anyone can be a lawyer, anyone can be an engineer. How do you know what to pay people now? Are these jobs really that much harder than say a janitor now that you can upload knowledge? 

Suddenly, no one knows what to pay people. People who went to school before the development of this technology now suddenly find themselves competing with infinitely more of their profession. The majority of what determines wages in a capitalist society, crumbles literally over night.

At best, society now pays people based on creativity and potentially performance. Having knowledge does not necessarily translate to application, although the technology may be able to solve this. People who are able to use their new knowledge creatively MIGHT be paid more but I am skeptical because you have just as many other people thinking creatively. The supply drastically increases and thus the demand and price falls. 

Society itself now has to completely reorganize itself from institutions that have been built on for thousands of years. Could this arguably be a good thing? Perhaps although I guess I’m not creative enough to see it. Will it absolutely unravel the fabric of society, for good or bad? Undoubtably. And again this is WITHOUT anything going wrong. CMV

corporations should be required to pay for the disposal of their products.,"If companies were explicitly responsible for the disposal costs associated with their products it would incentivize the production of items that are more reusable and less costly to dispose of.

Yes, this would increase the cost to consumers, but consumers already pay this cost indirectly through taxes and degraded resources.

High Schools should have higher standards for graduating.,"Here is my view. A diploma is a piece of paper. It has no inherent value to society. In a way it is similar to money. It may have value to the person with it, but to a society as a whole it has no value. If you print more money, inflation occurs. The same is true for a high school diploma. Giving someone else a diploma makes everybody else's diploma less valuable. 

The only value diplomas have on society is they are an indicator of knowledge. However as the percentage of people with a diploma grows, this indicator become less valuable. I would argue the most effective indicator would occur at 50% as this splits people evenly. 

High schools that give diplomas without the student obtaining sufficient knowledge are doing a disservice to society as a whole.  High schools should have more rigorous standards so that the value of each individual diploma increases (as graduation rates decrease). CMV

&amp;#x200B;

Note I have no opinion concerning those with disabilities. Additionally I am not doubting the value of knowledge only the value of the diploma itself.

edit: This also applies to colleges and Universities as well.

edit2: Additionally higher high school standards will benefit the poor as they will be on (more) equal footing in high school as high school is free.",dbui5o,"We live in a society that places more value on education and degrees than ever before. Every year, more people attend college than the year before. This occurs because we live in a different world than we used to. With the rise of technology, many of the manual labor jobs that used to be a necessity have been replaced by machines. Therefore, the current demand isn't for manual labor, but for people to contribute to the technology behind them. Unlike manual labor, these new and emerging fields require an adequate education to navigate. I don't necessarily believe that handing out more diplomas makes them any less valuable. Instead, I think that in a society that places importance on education, more people are incentivized to receive that education and complete high school and possibly even higher education. Many jobs well-paying jobs only consider applicants who have completed high school, if not college or graduate school, so in an attempt to provide for themselves, more people are turning to higher education. 

I also think that handing out more diplomas doesn't devalue the ones earned. I would always talk to my parents and my grandparents about their schooling experience, and they always told me that they never worked nearly as hard as I did in high school. They would tell me stories about how easy school was ""back in the day."" The reason more people are earning high school diplomas isn't because of the rigor of the coursework, but instead due to the rising popularity of higher education in modern society.",f25z29t,3.25
Rapping (or singing) about expensive brands is harmful and makes the music hard to relate to.,"I feel that this has instilled a consumer culture within people more than was there before, and it is typically about expensive products that very few people can afford.

This not only leads to people feeling pressured to buy things they cannot afford but also props up industries that survive on hype and trends rather than delivering a quality product.

As someone that does not see the appeal in Louis Vuitton and Lamborghinis and is a long way from affording them I also find this music to be alienating and does not speak to my experience or an experience I can sympathise with.

People that are also not wealthy but like this kind of rap music, how do you feel when a rapper talks about these products?

I know this is not representative of all rap but I feel it is a growing trend and I do not understand the appeal.",huwseu,"&gt; People that are also not wealthy but like this kind of rap music, how do you feel when a rapper talks about these products?

Some people are inspired when they see or hear things that they want; they are given additional motivation to pursue whatever they want. Is this just a part of consumer culture? Probably. But they still buy into it; and they demonstrably have few problems with it, despite obvious drawbacks of such a culture. *But that's on them.* You don't need to concern yourselves with their reactions, or feel pressured by them.

Not sure how strongly this applies to music as opposed to things like speeches but it's something.

Fox News should be investigated for making unauthorized contributions to the Trump Campaign.,"Fox News seems to be the most-watched news service in the US. When you compare their coverage of anything Trump with the other major services they are  complimentary toward him and play down or ignore negative stories. The network promotes a conservative point-of-view (which is probably good for balancing news coverage) but there is a big difference between balanced reporting and blatant support of the Trump Campaign and the Republican Party.

Fox News seem to devote a lot of their air time to in-depth coverage of the good side of the President, including giving him air time for frequent live appearances. This could be interpreted as a contribution to the Trump campaign since the opposing candidate almost never appears, more rarely in a long-form interview environment. It could also be argued that Fox News is at least partly foreign-owned (considering the Murdoch family). 

I propose that Fox News be investigated for providing non-monetary but highly valuable contributions to the Trump Campaign and the Republican Party.",hatkgc,"(1) Advocating for a political stance, a political party or a politician in no way counts as a contribution to political campaign and/or party.

(3) I think what you want is something similar to an Equal Time Rule but not for candidates.

However, the FCC has ruled that it only applies to talk shows on a case-by-case basis. In addition, this only applies if the candidate is directly receiving coverage. If Fox News is covering the Trump Campaign as a whole, and not directly granting time to Donald Trump, they aren't in violation.

Metric is better than imperial and the US should switch,"Quickly, how many pounds are there in 100 ounces? How many feet are there in a mile? Which is greater: 5.5 pints, 94 fluid ounces, or 3 quarts? How many square yards are there in an acre? 

At the very least, most people would fumble a bit before seriously answering any of these questions. Maybe even use a calculator or reference guide. At worse, some people would not try or be able to answer some of these questions. 

The Imperial System is obviously very clumsy and confusing to use even for Americans. This is the reason why the United States of America should finally stop using the Imperial System of measurement. To be fair, there are two other countries that also use the Imperial System, and they are Liberia and Myanmar (Burma). 


These three countries should instead use the Metric System. The Metric System is superior to the Imperial System for three reasons. 

First, the Metric System is simple to understand. The simplicity of a base 10 system of measurement, such as the Metric System, makes it extremely easy to understand especially when dealing different scales of measures, such as meters versus kilometers. For example, it is obvious that 100 meters is 1/10 of a kilometer. No serious thinking is necessary. 

Second, calculations in the Metric System are also easier. This is probably why most researchers, doctors, and scientists use the Metric System even in the United States. For example, which is greater: 989 grams, 1.1 kilograms, or 1 million milligrams? How many meters are there in a kilometer? How many milliliters are there in 1.25 liters? 

Third, the Metric System is the international standard. This is probably the most important reason. Car manufacturers already realized that having similar parts in different measurements for different countries was a waste of resources, so all cars are now built using the Metric System for redundancy eliminations and cost reductions. Furthermore, all goods exported outside of the United States have to be label in metrics, or else they can not be sold. N.A.S.A. actually lost a $125 million dollar spacecraft, called the Mars Climate Orbiter, over the planet Mars, because one team was using the Metric System and another team was using the Imperial System. That was a very costly mistake that could have been avoided if everyone in the world used the same system of measurement. Since over 90% of the world uses the Metric System, it is by default the international standard. 


The Metric System has been proven to be far superior than the Imperial System, so why hasn't the United States of America converted? I believe it is NOT because Americans are afraid of the Metric System, but rather Americans are concerned over how painful the conversion process would be. In the long term, I believe the benefits and cost savings to convert to the Metric System would greatly offset the short term inconveniences. 

As a result, the United States of America should finally and completely stop using the Imperial System of measurement for the Metric System that has been proven to be simpler to understand, easier to calculate, the international standard, and reduce redundancies, errors, and costs.",w30y8d,"Just out of curiosity, can you give realistic (even if hypothetical) examples of where a person needs to do these calculations?

I am not a God denier trying to prove the non-existence of God, but trying to understand why God is portrayed as he is. Most western religions explain God as all-knowing, all-powerful, and all-loving.

However, also because of experiences in my life, I think he is not all-powerful and is bound by a set of rules he can not change. We only advance through struggle, if he is all-loving and all-powerful he would have set up a better way for us to grow.

Openly carrying gun owners at protests are some of the least likely people to defend others in the case of an actual gunfight,"Look I don't want to get into the idea of whether or not the 2nd Amendment is ok or not. For this view, it's legal, they have the right to do so and are not breaking any legal rules by carrying their weapons in an open carry state.

But every time I see these pictures of protests... I see a group of individuals, almost all white, usually in combat gear of some sort, or hunting gear. Generally a single firearm proudly holding onto it as if it's some kind of phallic symbol of power. 

But it's not protecting *anyone*. Oh sure, it's there 'just in case'. But just in case of what?


That the police come? You are prepared to shoot the police? Last I checked most legal gun owners were pro-police. Usually 2nd amendment people are the most ardent supporters of the 'blue line'. So you're going to shoot them?

Ok, so not police. Then the military? The National guard comes in, you're going to shoot them? So the people whose camouflage you are wearing, many of who have served as well, are now going to shoot their fellow patriots? 

Ok so not the military.

The random bystanders? No they aren't armed and what kind of threat is posed here.

So there is no real chance of a gunfight. But yet you're bringing a firearm to a public place brandishing it as if it's locked, loaded, and ready to be used....despite the fact that the above scenarios have shown the likelihood of you using it is... 0?

This leads me to believe that it's all for show and the person most likely to actually defend his fellow person is not the one openly carrying a rifle, but the CC owner who is able to defend himself without needing to let everyone know. 

Making up for your shortcomings by trying to use intimidation is not a substitute for the power of your words. Proper gun ownership teaches:

* Don't point a gun at anything you're not willing to kill
* Always assume a gun is loaded
* Be sure of your target and what lies behind it

By bringing openly carried rifles without intending to use them or having any reason to carry, the only reason I can find is for intimidation and making yourself feel bigger than you are. Teddy Roosevelt always used to say ""speak softly and carry a big stick"", but there's a quote by Leonardo Da Vinci that says ""He who truly knows has no occasion to shout"". If you're truly there to 'protect' people, brandishing your weapon as if you are ready to fire, acting like a military individual in a war zone, it's pompous, irresponsible and frankly impotent.",g9dz22,"&gt; But it's not protecting *anyone*. Oh sure, it's there 'just in case'. But just in case of what? 

Most of these protests are linked to protesting against gun control as means of reduction of gun violence.

The United States is closer to oligarchy than democracy,"It's hard to argue that the monetary influence on both who gets elected and which laws are passed far surpasses the influence of the vote to the point where it (almost) doesn't matter.

In order to even make Congress, you have to be backed by corporations and billionaires, or be one yourself.

Laws are bought, not debated and decided on with reason and the best interest for the country. Net Neutrality is a great example of oligarchs pulling the strings, as is the private prison industry lobbying against legalization. 

There are exceptions, but they face an absurd uphill battle. Oligarchy is built into the system given the vast amount of power money has in the political system, and laws that seldom restrict it (why would the parasite administer it's own antibiotics?) 

In summary, with campaign donations and lobby (little more than legalized bribery) there's no reason a politician would disobey the will of their corporate doners when the propaganda campaign to bring them back to office will be well funded. 


""Specifically, if fewer than 20 percent of wealthy Americans supported a policy change, it only happened about 18 percent of the time. But when 80 percent of them were in support, the change ended up happening 45 percent of the time. There's no similar effect for average Americans.""

I don’t think it matters if animals are killed humanely for food.,"
When it comes to food, I don’t care if an animal has a quick and painless death. It would be nice if it could but if it doesn’t... I’m indifferent. 

If I was at the grocery store, about to pick up a couple of delicious duck breast or a whole leg of lamb, and you told me that these farm raised animals were in agony for 9 minutes before they died, I would not not buy the meat. 

Or if you told me Chick-fil-A’s supplier of meat botched the slaughtering process for a batch of chickens... I would still got get me a #4 with a lemonade (no ice). 

Now I don’t advocate animal cruelty *just because*... like dog fighting, burning kittens, skinning raccoons alive or dragging a live deer behind an ATV for giggles. 

I’m not saying being mean to be mean. I am saying when it comes to the process of making food available, I can easily excuse the bad. 

And yes... I will openly admit there is hypocrisy in my stance.


I just know that supplying meat for tens of millions of people is not an easy task. It won’t be a clean task and it won’t always be a humane task. I don’t think it’s avoidable really (at a price for most people).

Or you can look up how animals are genetically breeded to the point their bodies break down in the pursuit of maximizing output. It's pretty disgusting stuff. But anyways, so it's not really just about the minutes before they die, it's about suffering their whole lives. Are you also indifferent to that?

It is a legitimate choice to not vote in a democratic election,"Democracies across the globe can vary hugely. To compensate for this, I am restricting the scope of examples to the UK and US (whose political systems are already very different!). I have 2 main arguments. 


A) Both the UK and the US have flawed non-proportional electoral systems so for most individuals it does not matter who you, as an individual, vote for. 


B) For some, all of the available options are equally bad. It is not reasonable (or practical) to ask an individual to stand themselves.


Non-proportional systems are intrinsically undemocratic as the say of some individuals matters much more than others. For most people, a combination of the odds being stacked in favour of one of two parties and the all or nothingness of the system means the outcome of their constituency or state is virtually predetermined from the outset. 

For example, if you are a republican living in New York, it frankly isn't worth spending the hour or so travelling to a booth and wating in line. Whilst I am not a psychic or an expert on American politics, I can say with absolute certainty that Mr Trump will not win there. In fact, I was stunned to find out that Republicans won NY presidential elections as recently as 35 years ago. In the UK, we have constituencies that have always voted for a single party. 

Additionally, in many cases both options are unpalatable. For example, in the UK do I vote for the virulently racist and homophobic Conservative Party (literally nicknamed the Nasty Party) or the seemingly incompetent and anti-semitic Labour Party? Fun choice. 

It's also not reasonable to ask me to stand for several reasons. Firstly, running an electoral campaign requires vast sums of money and time that I just don't have. It's almost impossible to win without this. Secondly, I have a personal history that makes running for office even more difficult. The gay dude with a foot fetish running for Prime Minister - the media would have a field month. Thirdly, even if by some miracle the stars aligned and I won, I can't win a game of Civilization on the hardest difficulty, I have no idea how to run a modern nation (though I suppose that hasn't stopped Trump). 

I am not too interested in a political debate of left vs right though for those interested I have both left and right wing views in roughly equal proportions. What I am most interested in discussing is why voting in non pr systems is worth it for individuals that don't live in swing seats.",cz8cet,"I promise, no one exists who hates both parties, or even both candidates in a given election, EXACTLY as much as one another.",eywze9g,2.5
Boycotting Amazon isn't even symbolically effective protest,"I have been wrestling with this subject for a while now as many of my friends and family argue on behalf of pivoting away from using Amazon at all. NYTimes actually published an article on it recently: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/style/amazon-abstainers.amp.html

It's ambitious, and I want to support it, but even when forgetting about the effectiveness of boycotts in general (I think we can all agree that there is a serious lapse in regulation, and that type of action is what's needed most here), I'm just not convinced that shopping on Amazon.com factors that much into Jeff Bezos' gratuitous wealth or the company's awful business practices. Please, CMV.

To summarize the handful arguments that I've been working on:

1) Amazon.com is more of a massive logistics operation than a shopping venue like Walmart. My understanding is that buyers set up ""shops"" and execute sales and whatnot on the website for the most part (there is, of course, the rising trend of Amazon-made products - is it substantial enough to discount this point?). So, in effect, Amazon connects buyers and sellers, and then manages the shipping process. When people say you should buy from a certain person or company, Amazon.com is sometimes the easiest way to find and purchase from them.

2) The margins are so slim on both the products and the shipping, that Amazon couldn't possibly be making all that much money of individual sales. As someone who looks to cut expenditures as a financial imperative (the looming doom inherent to modern life is a different conversation, let's just say altruistic nirvana is not an option), the fact that it appears that I am getting less ripped off on Amazon than, say, at a local bodega, gives me the impression that there is very little profit to be made, even when you factor in the yearly cost of Prime.

3) Most tragically, I think Amazon is an inescapable behemoth at this point. So you want to shop at your local ""mom and pop"" joint instead? Honestly, they might just order from Amazon and then add a couple dollars on top. Probably not, but they are certainly participating in a distribution system that is defined by Amazon. I need to say that I particularly hate this kind of ""ethical-capitalism"" where people acknowledge a disparity in cost, but justify it by saying they want to ""support"" a certain person or group. Why don't we just accept the cheaper, more efficient behemoth and then you can be supportive by making it so someone doesn't have to waste their entire day behind a cash register in a brick-and-mortar store that is likely prohibitively expensive to rent. Then, just go ahead and hand that person the extra $20 or whatever you saved if you really want to support them financially :D

4) On the subject of inescapability, let's not forget the fact that most of the internet runs on AWS. And, apparently the profit-margins on that are very good.

5) Finally, the stock market. Jeff Bezos gets his disgusting wealth from his shares in the company, not directly from sales: https://www.businessinsider.com/how-rich-is-jeff-bezos-mind-blowing-facts-net-worth-2019-4
It seems that investors have been going crazy over AMZN this year, and, unfortunately, many of us who work normal jobs are complicit in that through our retirement accounts (comments on that ""social safety net"" withheld for now - yuck)

Elements of human behaviour that libertarian socialists allege are features of capitalism versus anarchism are really features of large societies versus small societies,"For context, I'm a social democrat who's familiar with secondary literature on anarchism and Marx. I'm hoping to take this at a slightly more nuanced level than socialism 101. I'm going to try and make this short and not ramble.  

I think anarchists are falsely attributing bad features of society to capitalism when in reality they are features of big societies generally. I think anarchists wrongly believe that the benefits they theorize under anarchism is the ""true"" human nature that capitalism in some way distorts. I posit that regardless of economic or social system, most of the the human behaviour being discussed will fall in line with the scale of a civilisation far more closely than it does with that civilization's structure. These are some non-exhaustive examples to illustrate my thinking.  

 * **The anarchist principle of mutual aid** - Anarchists posit that a voluntary work system where everyone helps however much they desire to at whatever they desire working as is a unique feature of anarchism. Without very much encouragement, you can see this occur in any small group of people. Proximity breeds empathy, and a close connection to every person in the system and the obvious visibility of all of the socially necessary labor needed to survive means that mutual aid is inevitable. As societies grow, labor specialization eventually makes it impossible to know every person for whom you take and render services to. This distance introduces a previously non-existent temptation to take more than you give as you are divorced from seeing the consequences of your choice. Rent-seeking is scarcely possible when you're known to every person in the system, and the concept of private property itself is nonsensical. If capital co-ordinates labor, it should be obvious that when labor is simple to organise, the need for capital is limited. That said, complicated labor is responsible for incomprehensibly vast utile goods, and I don't think the principled argument alone outweighs the benefits of specialization that a global economy enables.

 * **The anarchist objection to coercive hierarchies** - I'm a huge fan of [this feminist essay](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm) and [this post from SlateStarCodex](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/) about social hierarchies. To paraphrase, as a community grows, the strength and complexity of the hierarchy needed to maintain it also grows. In large social groups, structurelessness is not an option - refusing to create intentional and accountable hierarchies leads to the informal creation of unintentional and unaccountable social elites who hold disproportionate social power. When a social group is very small, there is no need for strongly codified social rules. As the social group grows, the number of conflicting desires swells until rules are needed to co-ordinate them.  

 * **The anarchist principle of voluntary association** - In an isolated single community, the idea of voluntary association works fine. If you don't like it, leave, and go do your own thing. This works fine in small communities. However if a community upstream from me builds a dam on the river that we both share which kills the fish I need to eat, one side suffers coercion. Either the community upstream is obligated to compromise with me which ruins their right to voluntary association, or they're not, in which case I don't get to opt out of the relationship because my community is dependent on them. The larger a society gets, the more need there is for interaction and collaboration between people.   

 * **The anarchist problem of enforcement** - Conflict is inevitable, capitalism or not. Where social fights occur, in small communities it is sufficient for every member of the community to weigh in on resolution and punishment directly. As a community grows, conflicting aims also grow, and the ability to trust all community members equally to enforce proportionate justice is diminished. There is a need for some form of protective force to keep the peace by might. The existence of such a force is not only coercive in and of itself, but if my community autonomously decides we're going to seize some of the resources your community is depending on, might ends up making right. 

I'd love to have my view changed.",s2i81f,"This is a huge topic, and many of your points rely on assumptions about human nature and social structures which would need to be validated with archeological and anthropological evidence. Until recently, I definitely tended to share your view, as it conforms to a model of societal progression in which complexity is intrinsically linked to hierarchy which has been the dominant theory of civilizational development.

Rather than argue my nascent contrary views, I would highly suggest you read the recently published [The Dawn of Everything](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780374157357) by David Graeber and David Wengrow. The late David Graeber was a famed anthropologist and left anarchist and was a major figure in the Occupy movement. They considers many of the points you have raised and evaluates them against the historical, archeological, and anthropological records to see if such views are supported with evidence— for the most part, they are not.

It is really an excellent book, which though long, I breezed through because I found it so intellectually engaging. If you are seriously interested in investigating these questions, I think it is indispensable.",hsezdo3,3.4
I am dropping all Trump supporters from any reasonable social setting.,"I am fine disagreeing on any number of topics, and consider myself a fairly reasonable and open minded person. At some point however, you can't just agree to disagree and go on engaging with someone who supports reprehensible activity. I am fine with republicans, criticism of democrats, support of most republican policies, but it has become clear somewhere along the line that any further support of Trump and this administration is morally reprehensible and risks destroying the country. To that end, I have booted a few trump supporters from social groups and would no longer engage politely in settings where I learned of someone's political position.

That being said, this leaves a weird dilemma. It certainly seems awkward and unnecessary to ask someone's political position before socializing. I certainly don't want to have a loyalty test to join any given sowing circle.  Does Don't Ask, Don't Tell make sense for social engagement?

It has also been argued to me that instead of ostracizing, i should welcome and engage with Trump supporters to try to change their minds. I am of the opinion if nothing in the last 4 years has changed their mind, they are certainly not going to change their view with anything I say to them.  Clearly there is a line somewhere, and I don't feel i should be encouraged to nod politely at a dinner while someone espouses Qanon conspiracy theories or some such.

Am I wrong to shun these people?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

&amp;#x200B;

So I've gotten a fair number of replies asking I list out all the evils of the Trump administration I find so reprehensible. This kind of boggles my mind, as even if you don't agree you must know what his opponents object to, right?

But in no particular order, and without too much detail here is something of a list:

1. Assault on truth
2. Assault on science
3. Assault on the Press
4. Assault on democracy and voting rights, and legitimacy of elections
5. Encouragement of Racism, defense of racists, confederate legacy, racist travel bans
6. Encouragement and defense of police brutality

6a) Sending in DHS to seize people without accountability or due process

7) Using powers of government to profit

8) Using powers of government to his own political ends

9) Whatever the hell is going on with Russia

10) A badly executed trade war with china, bonus points for destroying TPP and then looking for allies to go against china

11) Gross mismanagement of the (stuff that is making the world sick)- \*trying to post without new moderation policy kicking in\*

12) jailing people at the border in inadequate facilities, separating families, imprisoning children

13) Gutting and corrupting important government agencies

14) Climate Denialism

15) Pushing through tax cuts in a booming economy to further mortgage the future for present political gain

16) Using the pardon power as a political weapon, or to help various cronies

17) Basing resource and tax decisions on who supports him politically, bonus points for life saving equipment during a pandemic

18) Promoting conspiracies, and backing conspiracy minded congress people

&amp;#x200B;

That's just top of my head. I'm sure I've missed some major items. Basically the exact kind of list you would think a trump opponent would be upset about. Not sure why this isn't obvious (even if you don't agree with the objections). But there you go.

So far no one has really changed my mind any, although I have enjoyed a few conversations. Also kudos to everyone for so little Hitler analogies. It's so hard!

We need to seriously change school classes.,"Students need to know basic math, reading, writing, spelling, basic history, economics, sexual health etc. But schools have taken it way too far. Most people don’t need to know AP calc or AP Chem or read 10 Shakespeare plays. Schools are supposed to prepare children for the future and for adulthood. That’s not what they’re doing for the most part. Here are some subjects schools should teach kids:

1. How to manage your money, get a loan, buy or rent a place, etc. 
2. How to pay taxes. 
3. How to not get scammed. 
4. How to drive.
5. What healthy and unhealthy relationships look like.
6. Consent.
7. How to not be a bigot.
8. How to be a nice person.
9. How to work with other people (group projects don’t count. I’m talking about classes that teach students basic skills on how to work with other people. Group projects don’t do that).
10. How to communicate well with other people.
11. How to deal with difficult people.
12. How to take care of your mental and physical health. 
13. How much money you need to have and the responsibilities of parenting. Many people don’t realize how big of a commitment parenting is and how it can take a toll on you financially and mentally.
14. How to not procrastinate.
15. What to do if you are addicted to anything (because you can be addicted to anything).
16. How to manage your time better.
17. What to do if you are struggling academically.
18. How to educate yourself on politics and why it’s important and why voting is important.
19. Being empathetic. 
20. How to properly do research.
21. How to make sure your sources are trustworthy. 

I’m sure there’s more but those were the ones that came to my mind as I’m writing this. These are all things every single person needs to know in the real world. The majority of people don’t need to know AP calc, chemistry, extremely old literature , etc. I’m not saying that we should get rid of these classes. These classes should serve as electives that students can take if they want to. But students should not be forced to take them as most of them will not need to know this information later in life.",ggu0a6,"The (apparently widespread) view that school should be the sole source of education for children is, I believe, dangerously incorrect. 

Children spend about 6 hours a day at school, so approximately 5/7*6/16= 26.8% of their waking life (assuming 8 hours sleep). Presuming that all they learn to go through life should be conveyed in that significant yet minor portion if their life is a major hurdle to getting children to grow up into people who know, as you put, things that you “need to know in the real world”.

I would like people to realise that all caregivers of children are influential in their education. I think even more importantly, the primary caregiver, be it a mother, father, other guardian, are in the best position to teach these real world skills.

Its much easier for a carer to sit down with their child while going through their own taxes to teach them about it. You wouldn’t expect a teacher to do the same, would you? Same goes with driving, buying a property, how to be a nice person, etc. 

Additionally, a lot of the things on your list also cannot just be “taught”. They need to be experienced. For example, you can teach people what empathy is at school. However, it is that 73.2% of the other time a child has where they need to realise how and when to use empathy. They learn this from interacting with peers, adults, and even those younger than them. As the saying goes, it takes a whole village to raise a child.

Schools should never be seen as the only place where a child learns, or even the main place. Their function is auxiliary. They teach children the things that their primary carers may not have experience in, such as AP chemistry or calc.",fq5yfws,3.75

Bitcoin will not remain a popular currency,"I have been reading about the viability of Bitcoin, and from what I understand, it does not make sense. I am not referring to crypto as a whole, just Bitcoin.

Here is my reasoning:

1. **Deflation is more disastrous than inflation:** Inflation means that price can change infinitely, deflation has a hard stop at zero. People do not have an incentive to borrow or lend during periods of deflation. There is no reason to buy today what will be cheaper tomorrow, and tomorrow is always the day after. 
2. **Debt is good:** A lot of Bitcoin enthusiasts talk about the perils of debt. They say that by adopting Bitcoin, people will only be able to spend what they already have. However, debt is useful. Debt is far older than fiat currency. It dates back to when we used gold. It is just far more systematic now. 
3. **A decentralised currency that doesn't quite work:** My concerns here are two fold. First, the decentralised nature of the Bitcoin ecosystem creates a preference for the status quo. Big changes take months or years of consensus building to implement. In several situations, it is important to change policies quickly. It is also hard to educate people about the long term effects of a new policy — the kind of policy that may be undesirable in the short term but has positive long term effects. 
Second, having a centralised Fed has worked well for us. Recessions have become shallower and further apart after the introduction of the Fed [[source](https://imgur.com/8kP9j4A)]. I do not see a benefit to abandoning a central authority. This point is specifically related to using Bitcoin as a currency. 
4. **It will not prevent war:** Contrary to what the Bitcoin Standard proclaims, it will not prevent war.  ****[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/nakext/according\\_to\\_the\\_bitcoin\\_standard\\_debt\\_enables/gxu5u16/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/nakext/according%5C%5C_to%5C%5C_the%5C%5C_bitcoin%5C%5C_standard%5C%5C_debt%5C%5C_enables/gxu5u16/?context=3) 
I find the entire book to be riddled with inaccuracies. But this one irked me the most. 
5. **ETH has far more promise and may become the primary crypto currency:** I see how NFTs can be desirable and Ethereum as a platform does seem to have the potential for future innovations. This boosts the value of Ether. The flexibility for change and error that we see on ETH is also a lot more promising than what Bitcoin offers. It is also likely that a new crypto currency may emerge that is more valuable. 

It may also be that I have only read the opinions of extremists in the Bitcoin boat. I have unfortunately not come across moderate ideas which might make more sense. In fact, I have primarily seen Bitcoin talked about in the context of a currency.",oaybmx,Can you give a timeline?

"There is no reason to be offended by words, including all variations of slurs.","Wouldn´t being offended simply mean that you admit to be what the word implies you are? Isn´t it just the matter of using reason to determine that you indeed don´t have a reason to be offended by someone calling you ugly, If you know you are pretty?

This applies for other way more ""offensive"" words too. I won´t name them, but I think in this time and age you can guess pretty much all of them. I mean, If a word is supposed to degrade a race for example, Is it not just the matter of knowing what and who you are, to not be offended? Or, if being offended for someone else, knowing what they are? It would also imply that by being offended by these words, you agree that they have some degree of truth.

I also think that the best way to fight these ""offensive"" words and slurs is to not fight them, but instead show people why they shouldn´t listen to them. Show them that they are not defined by them, and show them how to think for themselves.

The best ethnic cuisines are often the inauthentic Americanized versions,"I am a passionate world traveler and would like to consider myself a purist, but in most cases I have found the domestic versions of ethnic cuisines far superior to their ethnic counterparts. 

I think this goes well beyond “what we’re used to” and simple palate adjustments.  I think it has more to do with resources and quality. Yes, there is a lot of shit quality processed food in America, but we also have infinite resources being the wealthiest nation in the world. It follows that anyone with the means would make their way here from these foreign nations, bringing with them their cultural traditions.

I used to get so excited to try the “authentic” versions of the dishes I have come to love in a sort of elitist foodie gatekeeper mentality.  I have found the majority of them to be extremely disappointing and often bad. 

Examples:

Indian food - the rich, creamy, curry-heavy Punjabi dishes we enjoy in the West did not originate in India, but in the UK. Southern Indian cuisine is much leaner and more vegetarian based, and while there is still plenty of good food to be found all over the country the real prize is what we get in most stateside Indian restaurants.

Chinese food - I recently discovered a higher end Chinese restaurant near me has a secret “Chinese” menu of more authentic dishes. I tried a few, not very palatable at all. Weird fish based dishes and far less flavor/spice on this menu.

Mexican - this one is debatable, authentic Mexican street tacos and entrees are pretty outstanding in their own right. That being said, Tex-Mex is what I always come back to, it is true comfort food.

Italian - similar to Indian, the rich and creamy sauces found in the states are scant in Tuscany. Alfredo is very thin and oily, not as flavorful and robust as in the US.  This is a toss up, however as plenty of Italian dishes made in Italy are far superior, mostly due to the climate and freshness of the ingredients as well as the rich culinary traditions.

What do you think?",lol2u1,"&gt;I think this goes well beyond “what we’re used to” and simple palate adjustments.

Reading your descriptions of the Americanized versions below, I'm not sure this is true. In fact, it seems very clear to me that it *is* a palate thing, because you repeatedly talk about ""rich"" and ""creamy"", which in fact just means ""fat"", and American restaurant prioritize fat, particular with the use of a lot of extra butter--like *way* more than you would even think. It seems like your palate has become accustomed to that extra fattiness and associates it with goodness and comfort. Which is not a knock against you at all! This is definitely a uniquely American problem, and one I had a lot of trouble with too when I first started traveling and trying dishes in other countries. We are very used to our food being a certain way, and it's hard to break out of that bubble.

That said, it's also just a matter of preference. I loved Butter Chicken/Chicken Tikka the most when I first started trying Indian food too, but the more I eat it, the more I notice that the depth and variety of flavors in other dishes is much more satisfying to me. Italian food is my absolute favorite, and after traveling to Italy, it was definitely an adjustment, but after I started to think of them as different food cultures, it was much easier to appreciate the food I was eating for what it was, rather than trying to compare it to the Italian-American I was used to.

&gt;I think it has more to do with resources and quality.

As someone who also really loves to cook, I will say that it is actually often close to impossible to make some authentic dishes from other cultures in America. We actually *don't* have the resources, mostly because we just don't have the climate or the demand for certain things. Where I am, for example, it's extremely hard to find goat meat, which is prominent in many Middle Eastern, African, and South Asian dishes. It's also hard to find good, fresh seafood, although I know other parts of America don't have that problem. It's also more difficult to find particular spices, peppers, and other fruits and vegetables that grow closer to the equator. So when it comes to ""resources"" there actually are some constraints. The kind of amazingly fresh, bright seafood dishes that you might get in, say, Greece, you're just not going to be able to recreate here. Ditto certain Caribbean or African dishes that require ingredients that are very hard to source.",go6f6ps,5.0
"There is no valid reason for looting stores (ex, Target) as a result the George Floyd incident","I’m all for protests. I won’t say I condone riots or setting buildings on fire but I can understand why they happen (riots are the voice of the unheard), I can also understand looting when there is a scarcity of basic necessities in a time where an oppressor is stockpiling resources while people are dying.

I tried but cannot think of a valid justification for looting a store off the back of someone being murdered by a cop. It seems like opportunistic thievery. I know there’s clearly systemic racial issue leading to inequality and that a small percentage of people are getting disgustingly wealthy, and the elected officials don’t represent people, etc etc. I think that looting in this situation undermines the goal for equality/seeking justice - ie. stealing a bunch of lamps from Target is not only ineffective. This would be pure speculation but based on what George Floyd's family and friends say about him I don't think that he would have wanted to die so a bunch of people can steal from stores. Furthermore, the people who support looting are a hindrance to progress.",gutkyk,"I feel like you're not interested in having your view changed because ""valid reason"" is... what, according to you?

A huge number of problems in the United States would be solved if politicians were limited to a single term.,"I hate politicians. Primarily at the federal level, but at the local level I'm still not a big fan. Our world needs order and someone needs to make the rules. I hate, however, that being a politician has become a class all of its own.

So much of the fervor and hate that exists in the country is fed and fueled by people pointing fingers at others and calling them evil. ""Republicans are racist, vote for me!"" ""Democrats are communists, vote for me!"" It all comes to the same point, getting as many people behind you so you stay in power instead of the other guy.

Some congressmen have held their office for longer than I've been alive. I'm a mom of two with a bachelor's degree. In that time, they've enriched themselves and their families/friends in the millions of dollars.

I've talked to people about this before, and they've always said that two or three term limits would be ok. I think one would be even better.

Once someone is elected, they spend so much money trying to convince people to vote for them, either by campaigning, or posturing in the political arena, saying they're doing so much, when in reality, nothing happens. No more re-election would erase all of that immediately. 

Yeah, government is complicated, it takes a little while to figure it out, giving an extra term or two helps them figure it out. I don't agree. There's been many a time where important laws get passed quickly. If you feel the pressure to get things done before you're replaced, you'll figure out a way to get things done faster. 

Having single term limits would stop the ""career politician"" from being a thing. You get one term at the local level, any position, and one term at the federal level, any position. After that, go back to being a dentist, or a truck driver, or a school teacher. Manipulation and lying wouldn't be something people get paid for anymore. Plus, people in office would be more in touch with the normal American.

Think of your least favorite politician.(Trump doesn't count, he is a lot of things, but he is not a politician) How much better would it have been if they'd been released back into normal life years ago? Or if they had a definite end to their awfulness in a few months? It'd be a bummer for the very few good ones there are, but with more turnover, more actual good people would have the chance to make a change. Good honest people who would be willing to take a break from their lives for a couple of years to make good changes in their communities.

I would really love to be taught some different aspects of this. I'm not an expert of government or politics, so I really want to be taught the flaws in my thought process.

I'm not saying it would be the ultimate best answer, but it would fix a lot.

Edit: Thanks so much for the people who responded with info instead of just saying ""people like you are why the world sucks."" I've given out a few ∆s. My view is changed.

A big problem in politics is the corruption. If the ""career field"" wasn't so insanely lucrative, it would resolve the problems more than putting a single term limits. The prospect of being reelected would be a bit more incentive to actually do good, but keeping lobbying out of the picture would help a lot.",hyh435,"I've long thought that presidential terms should be six years and limited to a single term.

"Existential Nihilism, even if unhealthy, is a logical philosophy and can't be proven wrong","I'd like to start this thread by saying that I really want someone to change my view and convince me of another way of thinking, as I express, this one is unhealthy.

Existential Nihilism, as transcribed from Wikipedia: 
""Existential nihilism is the physiological theory that life has no intrinsic meaning or value. With respect to the universe, existential nihilism suggests that a single human or even the entire human species is insignificant, without purpose and unlikely to change in the totality of existence. According to the theory, each individual is an isolated being born into the universe, barred from knowing ‘why’, yet compelled to invent meaning.""

I slowly came to realize this after I decided no religion can be proven right, and their doctrine seems too unrealistic to me, being disproved by science in many ways. My theological status would correctly be described as agnostic, because I don't believe we can factually prove that God exists or that he doesn't.
(Notice that I differentiate religion from God, I find religion false, while I find God unknown)

Without any way to prove there is a superior force that affects this world and works in our favor, life doesn't have an outcome, if I die today or 60 years from now, what happens afterwards is unknown, so I don't know what my life's meaning is, if there is actually one, what drives me to live?

Another thing I should bring up is Faith. I find faith to be irrational and an attempt from people to give life meaning. Do I find it wrong? No, I actually find it to be the best thing about religion, making people feel well, and give their life meaning of some sort. But I am unable of such thing. Any faith I've been able to have is in myself,  being that I have an irrational belief I will succeed in most of the stuff I do and in life. (And somehow it works, but that's a discussion for another time)

Morals are also important when discussing this. I personally have morals and believe they are important to live in a society, and for the well being of myself and the people around me. Are these things important in the outcome of everything? No, but till I get completely subdued by this way of thinking, I must give blind importance to these morals. Despite this, other generally accepted morals I can't conform with and disagree, which I may create separate threads for.

In my daily life, I entertain my mind with other things and ilude myself, namely by focusing on emotion and not rationality, but it always creeps around, so I wish to change it.

PS: 
-I'd advice to refrain from trying to convince me of a religion or similar, it will likely lead nowhere, but I won't stop you and will discuss it with you as well as I can.

-I likely have spelling errors in all this text, but not enough patience to re-read it, so I apologize.

Edit:
-I guess I am not really looking for a philosophical debate, because the reason of my question isn't entirely discussing philosophy. I meant an answer that while disproving nihilism, it would give some meaning to life. Answers that show contradiction in this philosophy don't really get me somewhere.

-My first mistake was not knowing existential nihilism well enough, I can't create meaning either. Or better said, I can, like anyone, create and give meaning, but it has no value and would be similar to faith, in the way that it is a coping mechanic to deal with the lack of meaning life comes with.

-After a user's comment, I realized that even if the Christian religion existed, while alive, the point of living was escaping eternal suffering, but after dying, going to Heaven or Hell, life would be pointless again as I see it.

-I guess I reach a conclusion that only emotion can give someone's life meaning, and that people must create that meaning, altought this conclusion in no way helps me overcome my personal struggle with having reasons to live.",cn5zxi,"The problem with your application of this philosophy is that everything is relative to something else.

Trans women are not equivalent to biological women,"The same things hold true for trans men and biological men. A transgender person may transition towards being the opposite gender but they are not equivalent. People often argue that there is no discernible difference between a woman and man that has transitioned. This is not true. 

For example, a man that transitions into a woman does not have a uterus. A trans woman can't carry children and still has an XY chromosome instead on an XX chromosome. A trans woman can't have periods, while a biological woman can.  Additionally, a trans woman will also have a higher bone density than a biological woman will. 

This is precisely why USA powerlifting has banned trans women from competing.

Next, people often talk about gender. However, they are misguided on what gender actually means. The dictionary definition on gender is "" the range of characteristics pertaining to, and differentiating between, masculinity and femininity."" This is mainly used in relation to gender roles. Men like sports, women like dresses, etc. However, this is just playing into sex stereotypes. Gender means masculine vs feminine. For example, my older sister is a tomboy. She is more masculine compared to most women. However, my sister being a tomboy does not make her a man. In contrast, an effeminate man might crossdress or like fashion designing, but this does not make him a woman. 

Next, there is an idea that a trans-person has a brain that aligns with the gender that they want to transition towards. However, this is not true. The problem is that men and women don't have different brains. The brain is a sex-neutral organ. There aren't any structures that vary between genders. It's not like women don't have amygdala or men don't have a hippocampus. Gendered brains are pseudo-science, we are the same species.

Finally, you can see the double-standard society puts on this specific issues. Take the case of Racheal Dolezal, a white woman that pretended to be black to get an NAACP position. When the news broke out, virtually everyone on both sides of the political aisle condemned and mocked her. Dolezal then said she was ""trans-racial"", which only resulted in more mockery. We as a society can see that it is illogical for someone to be trans-racial and identify as part of a group that they don't have a biological basis in. If people want to transition or change their genders, that's fine. However, we should be realistic. A person who identifies or transitions to another gender is not the same as someone who already that biological gender. Trans women aren't women, the same way that Racheal Dolezal isn't black. There is no logical basis for saying that there is no discernible difference between a trans man/women vs a biological man/woman.",cnk7fp,"Racheal Dolezal was mocked, but aside from losing her job her racial identity is irrelevant to her daily life.

For instance trans women are usually very feminine and like traditionally feminine things and trans men, are usually extremely masculine.  One of the main criteria for gender dysphoria is playing with the toys associated with the opposite gender and having friends of the opposite gender.  There is even evidence that trans men existed in history and passed as men, while having jobs such as a doctor, soldiar or other male dominated jobs.   Brain scans also show that male and female brains exist and that men are more interested in things and women are more interested in people.

I understand this is a very charged issue but I've been struggling to reconcile seeing protests in the UK (my home). Firstly, I want to make it clear that I wholly support the BLM movement, and while I don't fully agree with the riots in the US I understand why they are happening.

However, in the UK we are having full scale protests, people attacking and injuring police officers etc.

This is a global issue and I am totally in support in people coming out across the UK in solidarity and remembrance of George Floyd and the many anothers who have lost their lives at the hands of awful police officers.

However, in the UK racism is far less entrenched and institutionalised in the police force than it is in the US. Don't get me wrong, we still have bad cops, and there is unlawful policing, such as minorities being disproportionately likely to be stopped for carrying a knife. I don't however think this warrants the response the UK has had. 

The vast vast majority of our police officers are good people, and the majority of unlawful police officers are put to swift justice. So it saddens me to see the actions of another country's law enforcement inspire rage and hatred for ours, who almost certainly disavow those actions as much as the protesters. I do know know who these protesters are protesting against. 

I am very aware there possible flaws in this logic which is why I feel motivated to post here.",gyx5dd,"Well i always thought the same about the german police. An then i read a bit for myself and found the incidents at Dessau. Where a prisoner suddenly catched fire and other things happend to people of color.

Those who call for education help don't care about Rural Schools.,"I see every day advertisements advocating for more funding for inner city schools because they don't have adequate access to STEM and computer science education. However, with living in a rural area of a heavily rural state I've only ever seen 1 person or advertisement advocating for rural STEMification and that was with a recent gubernatorial candidate who has a STEM background in a rural state. It seems, given that disparity, that the concern isn't STEM education. I want to know why, as it seems, rural America, specifically it's education, isn't important to those who advocate for educational increases and such.

Edit: Thank you all for this discussion, the subreddit did its job and has changed my view.",kls780,"It’s pretty much impossible to develop rural STEM jobs without something like a national lab being built nearby. If you want more rural STEM students/grads, you should support much higher levels of federal science funding to create more national labs.

This also drives education policy in these regions because local schools tend to focus classes towards skills required by local industry.

The network effect forces STEM jobs into a few hub locations due to how rare the skill set is and the need to cross-pollinate STEM workers.",ghax510,3.25
"Reddit is the worst site for politics, political congregations, and political discussion.","[CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc&amp;t=294s) made a hauntingly prophetic video in regard to how emotions, particularly, anger, manifests within large groups of like-minded individuals. Although it isn't explicitly stated in the video, I believe that a way to diffuse much of the problem is by having both sides talk to one another.

[Germany Talks](https://www.zeit.de/wissen/2019-08/armin-falk-germany-talks-behaviour-research-english)'s story is far too long for me to go through, but the essential gist of it is that once someone fills out a survey of their political views, they get matched up with those who, if they check the box to be able to talk to people that disagree with their views, have different political views. The project was an unexpectedly wholesome success and there are already expansions towards this concept.

Reddit is the polar opposite of Germany Talks. Like many other platforms, Reddit allows for the specified indulgence in particular communities that interest them. While the first thoughts that come to mind would be relatively non-toxic hobbies such as the News, Gaming, Jokes, and many others, the isolation between said communities creates a literal cultural divide between subreddits with the only means of interaction between the two is through cross-posting or organized brigades.

While this isn't necessarily a bad thing as r/gundam isn't remotely related to r/accidentalitalian, issues arise when communities that revolve around politics surface. If you watch CGP Grey's video, the anger germ doesn't get cultivated between two groups interacting with one another, they get cultivated and get increasingly toxic in settings between groups of like-minded individuals (sound familiar?), where they get angrier by stating their detest for the other side (it sounds familiar to me). These politics also spread and take over other subs with wildly different purposes. While r/unpopularopinions used to be about, well, unpopular opinions, now they're a circle jerk hub of conservative viewpoints that aren't necessarily seen culturally as ""popular"" in mainstream media. r/murderedbywords is now a dilapidated retardation of r/trumproasts. And r/conservative and r/ChapoTrapHouse are toxic to anyone who doesn't exactly align with their beliefs.

r/changemyview is the subreddit ontop a shining hill confoundingly by actively encouraging participation on both sides. However, I believe that since the CGP Grey-effect is in full swing, people who lean on either extreme are disconcertingly becoming more and more unwilling to talk to each other, because ""obviously the other side is a brainwashed moron who needs Fox News or CNN to spoon-feed them fake news since they can't think for themselves. I watched Mr. Robot and it really says a lot about our society."" This leads to the trend of more and more centrist voices only participating in this sub, which although I don't discredit centrist opinions, is hardly a viable method for us to be able to congregate and discuss matters on political issues that concern us.

As a self-pronounced conservative myself, I get offended when someone attacks me of my viewpoint by generalizing me to fit a stereotype when they claim that they want to strip everyone from their stereotypes. I get offended when conservatives become disillusioned with ""society"" with their few encounters with those with political opinions that are different to them under the guise of ""we just want to talk!"". I get overjoyed when there are people like Boyan Slat who, at such a young age, created such a needed technology for our society and am unapologetically appreciative to people such as flat earth community, who dare to challenge against the industry-funded research and are willing to even do their research themselves. But if you bring up the good qualities of flat earth or even the anti-vax community, whom I'd applaud for similar reasons, (and also abhorrently hate for other reasons) in a discussion? You immediately get downvoted and essentially, for all intents and purposes, suppressed because you *dared* to speak against the hivemind.

We need more systems in place on our website, which does have its good qualities, to be able to encourage and cultivate programs similar to Germany Talks. I don't have a system in mind. posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/dlfx9n/can_members_of_the_trump_cult_be_deprogrammed/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) or (truth be told I looked around in my own traditionally conservative subreddits for an example to balance things out but it's 12 AM on a school night so I'll let your mind fill in the blanks) is not only unhelpful, hypocritical, but kind of pathetic. Now [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouFellForItFool/comments/cjlngm/you_fell_for_it_fool/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)? this is good shit.

EDIT: I would like to clarify a couple of things after receiving some helpful comments.

While I'm unsure if my identity would be relevant at all to the discussion, I feel best that it'd be helpful to point out that I am a 17-year-old Asian-American living in Asia. I lived in America for brief periods of my life and studied abroad in Canada for several years. I hope this clears up any sort of potential mischaracterization of my identity.

Victims of sexual assault should not be required to pay child support,"While female sexual predation of males is more rare than the reverse, in the context of statutory rape of males by women, there is the possibility that the non-consenting child will inadvertently father a child as a result of the rape.  In every state that has considered the question, fertile male victims of child sexual abuse by adult females have been ordered to pay child support despite the fact that they were unable to consent to sexual intercourse at the time of conception.  

Every state within the United States criminalizes all or most sexual contact between adults and children under the age of 16 or 18.  State legislatures reasonably concluded that younger adolescents lack the emotional, mental, and physical maturity to consent to sexual relationships with male or female adults.  These laws are referred to as statutory rape laws because, unlike rape at common law, consent is not a defense.  In virtually every state, a violation of the statutory rape laws is a serious felony, that often comes with lifelong consequences (including registration as a sexual offender).  Statutory rape laws are part of a comprehensive approach to laws involving children, with penalties and regulations paralleling the laws in place for  other sexual crimes involving non-consenting adults or children.  The relative age and maturity of children also factors in to restrictions in place for their well being in other areas of the law, including medical decision-making, labor regulations and even contractual agreements.  In general, and for obvious reasons, the adult in the transaction bears the burden in the event that the prohibited transaction is revealed (as with sexual crimes including statutory rape) or the child no longer wishes to honor a contractual agreement (in the case of a business or vendor who wants the minor to honor a contract).  

This is not the case with statutory rape of a male child that results in the birth of a child. A leading California case on this question, Cnty of San Luis Obispo v Nathaniel J (57 Cal Rptr 2d 843 (1996)) illustrates the approach of American courts: In that case, Nathaniel was a 15 year old boy seduced and raped by a 34 year old female named Jones.  Nathaniel described the sex as ""mutually agreeable act,"" but Jones was prosecuted and convicted of statutory rape.    After her conviction, the prosecuting attorney's office brought an enforcement action against Nathaniel, claiming that he was not meeting child support obligations and the state was entitled to collect reimbursement from him for social welfare payments made to his daughter.  

In the case of Nathaniel J, the court said that he was not ""innocent"" as he consented to the sex, and the court determined that public policy favored child support payments even in cases of child rape.   In essence, the court held that Nathaniel was liable for child support  because he voluntarily engaged in sexual intercourse despite the fact he  was a minor at the time.  No one disputed that he legally **could not  consent to sexual relations**.  And his case is no exception; every court that has considered the issue reached the same conclusion, using the same reasoning. See, i.e.,   Michael J. Higdon , FATHERHOOD BY CONSCRIPTION: NONCONSENSUAL INSEMINATION AND THE DUTY OF CHILD SUPPORT, 46 Ga. L. Rev. 407, 425 (2012).  

 The reasoning has even been extended to cases of non-consensual sex. See S.F. v. State ex rel. T.M., 695 So. 2d 1186, 1187 (Ala. Civ. App. 1996)(sexual assault while man was asleep); In re Paternity of Derek S.H., 642 N.W.2d 645, No. 01-0473, 2002 WL 265006, at \*1 (Wis. Ct. App. Feb. 26, 2002) (unpublished table decision)(child support imposed even where jury found that man's sexual intercourse with mother was involuntary).  

There are a number of reasons that this rule does not make sense.  Apart from the fact that nonconsensual sex is nonconsensual, and therefore any sexual assault does not involve a choice on the part of the victim by operation of the law, the law of many jurisdictions perversely excuses \*voluntary\* sperm donors from any liability for child support. In Wisconsin, for example, a semen donor who provides sperm to a licensed physician to be used in artificial insemination of a woman other than the donor’s wife bears no liability for child support (and also has no parental rights).  Yet if this same woman raped the man while he was rendered unconscious, she would be entitled to child support.  And the law on sperm donation is logical; by freeing the donor from liability and the prospective mother from fears of later claims of parental rights, artificial insemination has become an alternative option for millions of people who might not otherwise be able to conceive.  

What does not make sense is imposing liability on non-consenting victims of sexual assault.  A woman who rapes a minor or adult male and becomes pregnant as a result should not be entitled to receipt of financial support from her victim.  Nor should the state have any right to pursue male victims of sexual assault for child welfare payments.  

If you disagree, change my view.",lm3lqd,I think the issue is deeper than just child support - why is a statutory rapist receiving custody?,gnt4q1o,2.5
The Monster's name IS Frankenstein.,"There is always that one A-hole that needs to be pedantic and clarify that the Monster from the book ""Frankenstein"" is never giving a proper name and that 'Frankenstein' refers to the scientist (Victor Frankenstein) that creates the Monster. But in the book, the Monster thinks of his creator as his father and there are several instances where the father/son dynamic is allude to, despite the fact that V. Frankenstein rejects his creation. This (although strained) 'father/son' relationship would allow the Monster to take his creator surname as his own. Further, as parents are wont to say, "" I brought you into this word, and I can take you out""; Victor if nothing else did literarily bring the 'Monster' Frankenstein into this world and even tried to take him out of it. Additionally, the Monster when he confronts his creator questions why he was abandoned and left to fend for himself. From the Monster's perspective, he felt that is creator had an obligation to care for him in the same way a parent must care for their child. In this narrow sense, Victor acts  or is expected to act as a parent, which makes him a parent. **This is why the Monster can and should be referred to as Frankenstein**  or the Monster Frankenstein ( to avoid confusion with his creator.)

My argument is not that the Monster has a legal right to use the name 'Frankenstein'. ( he does not- because he is not legally a person, but a mish-mash of a bunch of already dead people.)

This is a  (slightly tongue-in-cheek) argument for the Monster's  justification in potentially choosing to take on his creator name and using it in the more common sense in which names are used. i.e.- an identifier.",jlbn3e,"On page 218 of the original edition ( published January1818 Lackington, Hughes, Harding, Mavor &amp; Jones), the creature is talking with the old man in his hovel and tells him, ""It's always 'aghhh'  or 'help' but never 'Brian'.

Vegans (especially if their diet is because of environmental reasons) should consider consuming insect proteins,"I want to be clear that the word 'consider' is intentional in my title. My view isn't that they should definitely start consuming insects right now without any thought. My view is that their consideration should go beyond something like ""I'm vegan and vegans don't eat meat, thus consuming insect proteins would be wrong and that's that""

&amp;#x200B;

\- Insect proteins contain B12, Iron, and a nearly complete protein. These are things that have to be supplemented in a standard vegan diet.

\- Insects get slaughtered by the millions to harvest plants anyway. There isn't a way (commonly used) to avoid killing insects to produce most food.

\- Harvesting plant based foods also kills birds, rodents, and small mammals like rabbits. This isn't the case with insect farming.

\- Insects offer the possibility of ""vertical farming"", taking up far less land per calorie produced than even plant based foods (and also cattle/chickens obviously)

\- Insects also thrive in very densely packed environments, great again for space used per calorie produced

\- If a vegan places different values on species at all, they may even have a **duty** to include insects in their diet. Insect farming doesn't kill mammals that can feel pain, farming plant based foods does. So by consuming insects, they are avoiding kill birds, rabbits, voles, etc...

\- I've heard from vegans that ultimately the idea is to ""do the least amount of harm"". Consuming insects that can't feel pain, and that have a very short lifespan anyway, and that would be killed to produce crops anyway....seems like lesser harm than all the mammals and insects that are killed to farm crops.

Quick note: I really don't want to get hung up on whether or not insects can feel pain. I think we can all agree that to the best of our knowledge, we think a mammal is more susceptible to pain than in insect.",f9et34,So something I would ask first is... in what form are we consuming these insects?

So I base the opinion off the fact that most of the world's happiest nations are much smaller than the US population-wise.

Conservatives aren't being unfairly censored.,"Conservatives aren't being censored. Racists, misogynists, homophobes, transphobes, conspiracy nut jobs, and (recently) insurrectionists are the ones being censored. There is nothing in the terms of service of Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Reddit, or any other platform that explicitly discriminates against conservatives. If conservatives weren't any of those things I listed, they wouldn't be be banned. You can be a fiscal conservative, you can believe in the border wall and stricter immigration, you can be a Christian and hold traditional values and you won't be banned from these platforms on that basis. Even known white nationalists like Nick Fuentes are verified and remained unbanned from Twitter because they do their best to dogwhistle and stay within the limits of the TOS.

In addition, liberals and progressives aren't immune to censorship. If they break the TOS, they will be banned. And it has happened; notable left wing streamers and content creators have been banned from Twitter. The YouTube algorithm once unfairly demonetized LGBTQ content creators because it falsely flagged them as sexualized content.

My point is that political affiliation isn't something that any social media company takes into consideration for their terms of service. If anything, conservative companies like Parler are the ones using political affiliation to ban users. Any disproportionate censorship that conservatives face on Twitter, YouTube, etc. is their own fault.

I'd also add that these companies are almost purely driven by profit motive. They don't care civil rights, they don't care about LGBTQ, they don't care about cyberbullying, they don't care about disinformation. All they care about is their bottom-line, and conservatives pose a huge risk to it by jeopardizing their ad revenue.

The problem is that those labels are being applied way too broadly, and most of the people who are falling under them unfairly are conservatives. 

Racism ought to be only specifically trying to oppress people because of their race. Not anything that happens to disproportionately cause people of a race any unpleasantness. Capitalism isn't racism. Preferring tradition over modernity isn't racism. Criticizing cultures that are associated with specific races isn't racism, especially when the culture could be changed for the better (e.g., cultures that champion education should be praised and those that eschew it should be criticized.) 

It's similar for all the others. Recognizing biological differences between men and women isn't sexism.

People who support right wing politics are either ignorant or selfish,"As the title suggests I support left wing policies on a lot of economic and social issues.

I genuinely don’t understand why this is such a popular idea, and why more people aren’t struck with immense dread.",gsbtjf,"I think the concept of destiny &amp; fate can have very positive effects when applied to the past instead of to the future. Think about a time where you accomplished something or were very happy, and then think about all the little events that had to go exactly right to get you to that point in time. For eg. I frequently think back to my close friends in college, how each one of us had to get into that college, choose it, per-chance bump into each other, have conversations, etc. to end up friends. Framing that as a ""meant to be"" has positive effects on my mood. Many positive psychology researchers recommend similar exercises (eg. the Science of Well Being course on coursera talks about this)

As for the future, applying this concept has never bothered me much because I don't know that the future holds for me. I might be fated to suffer in life, or I might be fated to be super successful. Not knowing that means that I still feel that I am free to do what I want.",fs47yyc,4.5
Judgement and rejection is the sole and unnecessary painful result of the misunderstanding we have of each other,"Some people argue they don't like someone else or argue that a person should be condemned or should be different etc. Sometimes people even reject themselves on the basis they are not fitting their own moral standards.

Some people draw a bad guy of someone else on the basis that e.g. they got cheated on or the other person is their boss and gives them order or that person has committed a crime and would trivially reject them from any friendship benefit if not even enjoy to see them suffer

There are countless dramas about who's in the right religion, the right skin color, the right sexuality, who's phobic of what, who belongs to the right community, and causes people to infuriate themselves to the point they even commit hatred murders.

I'm not exactly sure to what extent this is trivial to demonstrate but I am in a mindset where I try to embrace reality as it is without any must or should and I believe to have an easier time mediating conflicts and avoiding them because I try to understand the inner reasons of everyone without any kind of judgement

I make the assumption that in a hypothetical world where everyone perfectly knew how everyone would function. Even the most sadistic sociopath would be workable with, because their killer instincts would be controlled, their pain would be eased, and likely so they would be made utility of. Nobody would be surprised by the fact they don't care your well-being. In my opinion, this would be utopia

So CMV but when you judge and reject on any basis you contribute to societal suffering because you lack the power or the will to really understand someone else.

e/ It has been raised in the comments my definition of judgement and rejection could be taken various ways so let's be clear I stick to that definition of judgement:

Judgement is implied wrongness or goodness in some persons. Making hierarchies and evaluating people. Judgement can take form of insults but not exclusively so. The idea is applying an idea of moral good or bad, (lack of) merit, (un)worthiness on a person or a community.

Similarly, when I speak about rejection I speak about rejection of others made on the basis of that judgement",n7rjpz,"I think it is optimistic to to say that all strife is down to a lack of common understanding. Realistically, people sometimes have reasonable but conflicting interests. If I apply for an interesting job with good pay, because I prefer to do things that I find interesting and like buying stuff, but don't get hired, it doesn't bring me any real comfort knowing that other applicants would also enjoy interesting work and money. Maybe the other applicant is a great person, who really needs the additional income, but it is just as likely that neither of us is obviously more deserving than the other.

Even if someone is behaving badly for sympathetic reasons, that doesn't necessarily justify the behaviour. Even if I know that who violently attacks me is only lashing out due to trauma from previous experiences, I still don't want to be attacked. It isn't enough for me not to have any unreasonable expectations of a murderous psychopath, I don't want to be murdered.

Understanding people's motivation and thinking may be useful for humanising them, and non-judgemental language may help with communication. But I don't think that means we should stop considering whether behaviour is acceptable or enforcing moral norms. I don't see that a world of perfect understanding would be a world in which no one did anything undesirable, it would just be a world in which people would have more information about those trying to wrong them.",gxehhs2,5.0
"I'm not sure why socialized healthcare is controversial in the USA, it seems like the Dec. of Independence &amp; Constitution guarantee it","I'm definitely no expert about this stuff, so I hope to learn a lot here.

We have this famous locution that the government should protect ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"" in the declaration of independence. The preamble in the Constitution doesn't change this much, saying that the goal is the ""common defense,"" and ""general welfare,"" of citizens, and to ""secure the blessings of liberty.""

To me it always seemed weird that minimal healthcare isn't directly involved here. I'm thinking here of things like emergency medicine, non-elective surgeries, and the like. I think it's hard to see how the primary way of insuring ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" or ""general welfare"" doesn't specifically mean saving your life, or reasonably preserving it. It seems like these statements basically say ""if the government does *anything*, it should try to keep you alive and well."" 

A lot of times I think of police services, for instance. We agree that the state should keep us safe. So, if someone shoots me in the leg, I can count on the government to take care of the criminal. If I lose my leg because of an accident, though, we must go through this sort of convoluted process with insurance and private healthcare. Plus, we have other positive rights, like roads, the post office, an attorney, etc. Perhaps you could even consider the army a positive right of something that defends you. Where did healthcare get left out?

What am I missing here?",jekw1z,"I see something similar with my constitution, the thing is that they have idealistic statements,  since they are idealistic and not literal, they become subjective, some people might say that healthcare protects life for example, while others might say that is bringing communism to the country, then going against those statements, it's more complicated than that, but what I mean is that most probably, that part of the constitution won't exactly affect legislation made.

From a simple moral point of view, healthcare is nothing more than the protection of life, and it's totally justified, not to mention the state exists to protect society, therefore healthcare it's not controversial, no matter what the constitution says.

The thing is, right now there are two kind of ideologies in democracy, one is Neoliberalism and the other is socialism.

Neoliberalism, to put it simple, is like Liberalism + Globalization, the important part to note here, is that the main principle of liberalism, is that the state doesn't interfere with the economy of the nation, it let's the economy regulate itself while it just watches over it, this sounds confusing, to make it more clear, liberalism arises from the American revolution, because the government decided who Americans where allowed to trade with and the prices, and liberalism wanted to get rid of that.

Socialism on the other hand, is born from the idea that liberalism didn't take Into account the injustices that would bring a state where corporations grew big enough to take over politics, where legislation is made in favor of corporations with no protection to the nation's citizens, therefore, the government should make some regulations to protect society.

Socialism will say that corporations have no interest in the average American being able to afford healthcare, because of this they need to offer healthcare for those who can't afford it, While Neoliberalism thinks this is interfering in the economy of the state, making health companies lose money, and people not being able to afford healthcare is the consequence of a flawed economy which they should try to fix instead of directly interfering.

This is why it's controversial, the ideals of both political models are not compatible with each other, I tried my best to not tell which side I am, because if I think people should be allowed to have free healthcare doesn't really matter, the truth is that free healthcare being controversial is totally justified, if we go with the definition of controversy, which is a public disagreement.",g9eyd4o,4.0
Democrats impeaching is a poor political move,"The main argument for impeachment I've seen is that the evidence suggests Trump is guilty and therefore should be impeached because that is what is right, regardless of what the Republican leadership says.

I would say I agree that the evidence is quite clear that Trump abused the power of his office, but the current political landscape means that being ""right"" doesn't really matter. Republicans have made it clear that they do not support impeachment and think that Trump is innocent (whether they truly believe this or just want to retain the presidency is up for debate). So, the articles of impeachment will be passed along party lines. Regardless of whether or not impeachment is ""right"", this makes it an entirely political act. Because the vote falls on party lines and the democrats hold the majority, it is easily construed as the Dems abusing their majority to attempt to remove a president they don't like. The articles move to the senate where the trial will happen. Mitch McConnell is best at blocking and overriding anything he doesn't like and as the majority leader in the senate will have no problems stone-walling conviction. The vote here will likely fall along party lines as well, further politicizing the process. At the end of the day, Trump won't be convicted and there will be an easy sound bite that the dems attempted a political coup, and the lack of conviction indicates no harm was done. This will drive moderate voters to vote Trump in opposition to the democrats' audacity to try and overthrow a president. Trump will likely be re-elected and the whole thing will have been for naught. Further, it will give a free-pass to more of this abusive behavior for his second term and future presidents.",ecfi68,"&gt; The main argument for impeachment I've seen is that the evidence suggests Trump is guilty and therefore should be impeached because that is what is right

If this were what Democrats truly believed and they were truly motivated by doing what is right, then they should (a) impeach regardless of the political consequences, and (b) do so in a scrupulously fair manner.  

They did (a), but avoided doing (b) in a shameful and unconstitutional way.  This is why I don't believe them when they say it's their moral duty.  If they were doing it out of moral duty, then they would do their moral duty to apply fairness and due process.  

&gt; I would say I agree that the evidence is quite clear that Trump abused the power of his office

No such evidence has been presented during the impeachment investigation.  The closest thing they have to evidence was a rumor started by Gordon Sondland based on his own suppositions, and the same guy stated under oath that he had heard the President very clearly contradict that rumor.  

Debunked rumors are not evidence.  

&gt; Republicans have made it clear that they do not support impeachment and think that Trump is innocent (whether they truly believe this or just want to retain the presidency is up for debate).

We definitely believe it.  All of the evidence is in our favor, even after an unfair process in the House.  

There is literally zero evidence against him, while there's ample evidence that Democrats are doing this as an election strategy.  

Already two House Democrats have defected from the party over this.  More of them may defect or vote against it, either out of moral duty or out of desperation to try to save their seats.  We don't know yet if the Senate will also oppose impeachment in a bipartisan manner, but it seems quite likely.",fbbur1g,4.0

Most omnivores can’t reasonably demand tolerance from vegetarians and vegans,"Let me start off by painting a heavily exaggerated picture to show what I mean.

*Fair trigger warning: There will be descriptions of animal cruelty. If you don’t want to read those, jump to the next heading.*

&gt;You’ve been in this town for two months now. When you moved here in the spring for your new job you really didn’t have any social connections in the area whatsoever. To say that you were thrilled when your coworkers invited you to socialize last weekend would be an understatement. You would meet in the backyard of one coworker. You already had a bad feeling when you heard that. A warranted bad feeling, as it turns out. As you arrived you already saw them. Cages of kittens, a few lambs, and a bucket full of fish.  
&gt;  
&gt;Your host greeted you. “Hey, I’m glad you made it. Take an animal”, he said as he strangled a lamb. “Umm… thank you but I don’t strangle animals…” you answered. A few coworkers have started to listen in, when you said that. “Not even fish?” one asked. “No, no fish either”, you answered shyly. An awkward atmosphere hung in the air. In a misguided effort to alleviate the tension the host spoke up again. “Hey guy… How do you spot a non-strangler…? Don’t worry: They’ll tell you, hahahaha.” He gave you a small pat on the back. “Just kidding… You’re one of the good ones, I’m sure. To each their own, you know.” And with that he took another kitten from the cage…

# Where I’m coming from

Okay, so I’m one of those “good ones” myself. I’m a bit more vocal online but in general I don’t tell anyone I’m vegetarian if there’s not a immediate need for it (such as an invitation to dinner), I don’t speak out against omnivores eating meet in front of me or try to missionize. Hell, I even buy meet for other people while running errands from time to time.

The one thing that has always struck me the wrong way, however, is the demand that vegetarians and vegans should be tolerant towards omnivores. I think it’s fair to say that most people nowadays have a strong distaste for animal cruelty and causing the needless suffering of sentient creatures is seen as unethical at the very least. Seriously, I’ve seen my fair share of people demanding torture for people that killed animals for their amusement. Most of them weren’t vegetarian or vegan (which is why I chose that allegory above). Yet they still don’t want to be judged by vegans or vegetarians.

If you care to locate the dissonance between those two things, it oftentimes boils down to “food is different and there’s no way to eat without causing some suffering.” But food isn’t really different: Most of us can live exactly as or even healthier and better without eating meat than on an omnivorous diet. We can’t really buy that explanation because our mere existence refutes it. Similarly it’s true that we can’t eat without causing some suffering but time and time again it has been shown that not consuming meat is probably the single most-effective harm/suffering-reducing decision an individual can make. The way I’m seeing it is that it’s basically a “I don’t care how the sausage gets made” situation.

If we are using tolerance the way we currently do, as the arbiter through which we enforce societal norms while still allowing for a pluralistic discourse, we should be consistent about it. You can’t have your ~~cake~~ animal love and eat ~~it~~ them.

Maybe ya’ll can make me stop feeling bad about being “a good one”: Change my mind.

"It's a bad idea to use inclusive gender neutral language when talking about abortion, pregnancy or childbirth","I have seen quite a few posts saying that people need to stop using words like mother, vagina, pregnant women, breastfeeding or talking about female reproduction. Instead advocates suggest using more inclusive language like front hole (instead of vagina),pregnant person, chestfeeeding, and uterus-havers (instead of women) when talking about abortion, pregnancy or childbirth. My issues with this is that it often starts to objectify women and 99% of the time abortion/pregnancy/childbirth is a women specific issue. I think it does more harm than good to try to separate women from a women-specific issues. I see why people want to include trans-men in this discussion but in my view it comes at a greater expense to have myself and women referred to as a uterus-haver, when 99%+ of the time those that have a uterus are women.

"it might be a double standard that it is okay for social media to ban/censor certain worldviews, yet cake makers must make cakes for people who are gay","Well, this isn't exactly a CMV because my view on this is not fixed. If I had to guess, my view is only that I think there is a double standard going on and I would like to have explained why it is not.

Let me start out with saying that I genuinely support the LGBT community and find that a lot of injustice has been done to them in history. I am completely convinced that people who are gay should not be discriminated against, that violence against them is completely unjustified, that they should have the right to marry and adopt children. I have a bunch of gay/bi friends, online and IRL, and I absolutely despise homophobes.

That being said, I don't think we can or should force homophobes to interact with the LGBT community privately. And as far as my understanding goes, most cake making services are private establishments.

Don't get me wrong: if a cake maker refuses to make a cake for a gay pair, I think they are stupid, but why would a gay pair accept a cake from homophobes in the first place? If I was gay, I would prefer knowing that the person in front of me is a homophobe so that I can tell them that they are a horrible person and that I could avoid them forever.

Aside from that, is it not a double standard? The argument goes like this: the ban and censorship of certain worldviews ""does not violate the right to free speech"" (the principle, not the legal stuff about the country prosecuting you), because social media websites are private companies and they have the right to not want to deal with certain people. You have no right to use their services unless you follow their rules. While most seem to be free on the surface, they are obviously not free as we give them a lot of our data.

Now, why do cake makers need to provide a service to people who do not follow their rules and conditions? And if we accept that they do, why do social media sites get to discriminate against people based on their worldviews?

If it is not a double standard, where is the difference?",kx4dtg,"The standard is this - You are not allowed to discriminate on the grounds of protected statuses.

"Ranked-Choice Voting, especially in single-winner elections, are designed to make traditional parties win while giving opponents of these parties the illusion of choice, and social democrat and libertarian Americans shouldn’t want it","Many Americans want to switch to ranked-choice voting systems.

At this point, three countries use this for national parliamentary elections, namely Ireland, Malta and Australia.

In two out of three of these countries, there is a two-party system.

1. Malta uses 13 5-member districts for their parliament and doesn’t even have any other parties in parliament.
2. Australia has two directly elected chambers, the House of Rep being elected through IRV in single member districts, and the Senate STV per state. Each of the six states has 12 (!) seats and both territories have 2. Back in 2016 they actually held an election for all of the Senators at once, which means you would expect a big break from the duopoly between the Liberal/National coalition and Labour, but out of the 76 seats, Liberal/National won 30 and Labour 26, leaving only 20 seats for third parties and independents.

Now let’s say you want Instant Runoff, the most common form of ranked-choice voting in the US with a separate social democratic and libertarian party. What happens in the presidential election;

1. Voters can vote for their initially preferred candidate
2. The libertarian candidate has the lowest first-preference votes. Most of these votes will go to the Republican, then there might be some going to the Dems and social democrats. The only reason I can see votes going to social democrats is their shared opposition to the war on drugs and interventionism but since they’re polar opposites fiscally it won’t give much.
3. Social democrats lose. The Democrats have had their primary already without Bernie and therefore are not splitting the vote, and considering how the election furthered with Biden vs Bernie I can assume the Dems have some more preference votes than the social democrats. And since any right-wing party that might lose will probably have votes going to Dems since they’re less leftist, the social democrats won’t gain from that
3. Final counting round a runoff between the Dems and the Republican

And in congressional elections, this will probably end up with similar results. AOC will retain her seat, but other districts where social democrats can’t even win the primary will not go to them. In fact, in an instant runoff, some social democrats in safe Democrat districts might actually lose their seats due to transferred right-wing votes to liberals.

Now a different story would be a multi-winner race. But where is this possible? Not for the presidency, maybe for House in larger states where there’s multiple seats. However, in states with one or few seats, this will still accumulate the centrist votes and thereby lowering chances of social democrats. Also, it will make voting hard in large states where voters will have to rank every individual candidate separately.

It’s clear the current parties are overdue, but to create a multi-party system, ranked-choice voting is not sufficien.",hrk6kd,"Yes, ultimately it would lead to Republican vs. Democrat, but it would remove some stigma against championing or campaigning for 3rd party candidates and political beliefs.

"Realtor fees for apartments are predatory, and landlords should be required to pay their own realtor","For those unaware, realtor fees are an extra cost on top of the rent and security deposit the tenant is expected to pay to cover the cost of the realtor hired by the landlord to help fill a vacancy.  Usually this fee is equal to one month's rent.

I'm not sure if this is strictly a New York thing, but it's the only place I've seen it.  In my view, the realtor fee is predatory because only gullible or desperate renters would actually agree to pay an entire extra month's rent so that the landlord can have a free realtor.

I actually got into a bit of a heated discussion with a realtor showing me around an apartment some time ago over this fee.  When going over the rent, deposit, and utilities, they indicated that there was a realtor fee.  I casually mentioned that I don't pay realtor fees.  Their response was that realtor fees are ""just the way it is"", and my reply was basically that it's only ""just the way it is"" if people accept it, and I don't.  I asked her to inform the landlord that I was interested, however they would have to pay for their own realtor.  Unsurprisingly I never heard back.

The problem is when the options are very limited and most (if not all) available places have a realtor fee attached.  If realtor fees are paid by tenants because they have no other good options then landlords &amp; realtors will continue to exploit renters.   When buying a house, the seller pays their realtor a percentage of the home sale rather than require the buyer to pay extra on top of the sale price.  For some reason though, landlords and realtors are more than happy to take advantage of renters.

CMV

Edit: A lot of folks have said that if there was no up-front realtor fee, the landlord would just bake the cost into the rent.  As another commentor mentioned that the fees realtors charge (especially for places where the rent is $3000+) are way too high for the value they provide.  The only reason they can charge so much is because the property owner isn't paying for it, but if dumping the cost on the renter wasn't an option then they would be forced to negotiate a reasonable fee with the broker, and *that* cost would be passed on.",eluhhi,"For a landlord, it's costly to find a tenant.

"I will totally support acting ""terrorism"" on Comcast for demanding better internet.","Living in an apartment with no other choice aside getting stuck with Comcast really sucks. It's even worse if the service goes out every other day. But I will pay my full respect and support to people who deliberately damage Comcast devices or jamming Comcast signals as an act of ""terrorism"", requiring them to lower the price and broaden the bandwidth.

At first it may not cost Comcast too much, but this cost can build up faster with wider and wider campaign. Raging people will be calling customer service, and the calling center workers on the other side won't be able to figure out what is the problem, thus submitting tickets for tech to inspect damaged nodes or jammed cords. At the same time, ""terrorists"" will utilize social media or forums for posting their request: fairer pricing, wider bandwidth and NO DATA CAP. It should attract customers from other ISPs to mock poor Comcast users, and ideally, catching public attention for triggering protests and FCC investigation against unfair pricing and data usage limits.

In the short term it may seem like a total lose for customers like us. However, if this campaign were to success to some certain degree, we will be the ones benefit from lower rate, better bandwidth and no data cap, i.e. reasonable service we deserved. It is worthwhile for me to pay the short term costs for long term profits. Therefore, I take anyone who are in it with a high regard, I will never be on the side of criticizing them or demanding them to stop.

Disclaimer: I will be fully supportive and respectful, but this **does not** mean I have the ball of doing so.

Religion has no place in the modern world and steps must be taken to eradicate it,"Now, this idea has been troubling me for a long time. The frustrating part is that it is the only strong view of mine that I feel is not justified by reason and my core values. I have a sort of irrational, almost instinctual distaste to religion as a concept, which is quite ironic since the opposite of being a part of a dogmatic religion should be open-mindedness. That's why I would like to ask you to either give me reasons to make peace with religion or be comfortable with this view of mine. Below are some thoughts I had about this.

First, religions are restrictive by nature. It is not a problem in itself, as laws are also restrictive, but the authority of the laws in religions lie not within utilitarian circumstances or human free will, but within an unreachable deity (or deities) and their sacred teachings, which cannot be questioned or revised. This makes the teachings of religion absolute for all circumstances, times and people, which is problematic as these tend to change. It is possible to avoid this by avoiding change, but I cannot accept it as change and progress is one of my values (besides, there is an argument to be made that change is unavoidable). I believe that currents are taking us to reality when the teachings (maybe not all, but many) of most religions will be obsolete and even harmful, so that is one reason to wish to remove religion from humanity's path.

Second, and this may be on the more ""irrational"" side, I find the metaphysics of religions problematic. Religions tend to have descriptions of reality, phenomena and truths of existence which are mystical in nature. Most religions have something to say about creation, the mechanisms of the Universe and what happens after death. This knowledge is not substantial in my opinion, as again it is derived from authority of a deity and sacred texts, and valid only if faith is present. In all fairness, science is not guaranteed to bring us to the truth either. Causality itself is an assumption which is true only as long as it is continuously verified, and there is nothing inherently certain about knowledge gained from evidence. Even so, I personally choose to believe in the assumptions of science and especially that evidence leads to the truth, and not to believe in the religious knowledge in sacred texts given by God (or deities in general). Epistemologically speaking, I don't think that one is necessarily better than the other, but personally I am biased towards science and against religion when it comes to knowledge about reality. The reason is that science brings consistent (and frankly satisfying) results and serves to improve our lives, while the knowledge from religion doesn't have practical utility and often even hampers education and advances in science. On a personal side, the knowledge about the reality in religions feels unsatisfying and against reason and common sense. I don't know whether it is just me, or whether everyone is a little frustrated with it, but I think it is better for us to have a knowledge base that is not being rejected by our reason. 

Third, and this is very subjective and I feel will raise the most objections, religions serve no useful purpose. Of course they don't really have to (some principles must be enforced in all cases - whether they bring harm or good), but my impression is that most religions are constructed so that it is implied they should bring happiness and good things to those who follow them. And I think they don't bring much good - not anymore at least. They might have been essential for building societies bigger than a family-tribe, but in modern world we have mechanisms that ensure successful cooperation without the same religion - or with no religion at all. We are tied first of all economically - we cannot live a modern lifestyle without all of humanity working together - fruits of globalism. Furthermore, many societies are deeply secular, and they are successful like that. The questions of moral nature are being taken care of by the law, based on the will of the people. So religion is not necessary for a society to thrive, in general. What about just useful? Also no, reasons as in the first argument above, plus they create unnecessary divisions. What about useful for the individuals? This is more tricky, as no one can vouch for all the individuals' experiences, but I will go ahead and say that even in that dimension religions are not that useful. Some people cope with stress through religion, enhance their emotional state and health, some are encouraged to do good through the teachings of religion, which I believe is important and impactful, and some derive sense of meaning in their existence. This all is true, and this all is very good for people, I agree. But I don't think that the source of it all is necessarily the religion itself. In fact, I think religion acts like a catalyst that unlocks people's potential to these positive things, but it is not unique and it is not indispensable for this purpose. People can be mentally healthy, motivated to do good and see meaning in their lives without religion. And my argument is that it will be even easier without it. I think people are more content when things fall into their places under their willful, controlled effort much more than when they do due to higher authority they cannot question. What I am trying to say, in religion life is not as reliant on an individual's action, so merit for good things also isn't felt as strongly as one's own, and that dulls the good things' intensity also. I will leave this thought at that, as I haven't developed it fully yet, but please let me know if I am making sense or if I am wrong somewhere.

About the ""steps must be taken to eradicate it"" part, I think above reasons are good enough to reach this conclusion. By getting rid of religion we (a) don't loose anything positive that we cannot do without, and (b) we eliminate all the negatives of the religion. I know this goes against free will and people's right to live as they want, and it is the main point of conflict for me, but for the sake of argument let's say this actually is worth it in utilitarian sense, and in the end will lead to more open-minded and free society. This is one last ""old-time"" measure to get rid of the ""old-time"" way of life. Of course the way it is done is important as well, so no coercion, no punishment for practicing, no violence, only subtle and soft methods. In the end, the process of abandoning religions is already ongoing due to many reasons. What I am proposing is to accelerate this process by enforcing and multiplying those reasons. 

Those were some of my arguments why to disagree with religion. Are they good enough reasons to want religion gone completely? Help me tone down that passionate voice inside, please. Thank you.",uvr5fd,"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/extra/85qihtvw6e/the-faces-from-chinas-uyghur-detention-camps

Bashing Republicans against trump (as is frequent on subreddits such as r/politics) is harmful and ultimately unproductive.,"I grew up in the south (SC to be specific). While I had parents who exposed me to a variety of ideas, and I grew up with many socially liberal ideas, I was surrounded by church going ultra right republicans for 18 years. As I went to college, I challenged myself to learn about new ideas and expose myself to a variety of solutions and ideologies. I have made huge strides in thinking for myself, and many of the people close to me push me to investigate things for myself and use logic (as I sometimes will get defensive (an emotional reaction) instead of using my brain; I am continuously working to improve on this). I am much more liberal than I was entering college (I’d say I’m pretty much a centrists) but if someone put a gun to my head, I’d probably say I’m conservative over liberal. 

This being said, I’m 21 now and this is my first election I can vote in, and I will almost certainly be voting for Biden. Trump is a despicable person who has no place as our country’s president. However, it is really disheartening to go on Reddit and basically see people bashing me for evaluating new evidence and slowly changing my views. People don’t change overnight, and it’s hard for me to continue and try to change and empathize when I hear rhetoric such as “remember they’re still republicans”. I have several issues with this:

1) it discourages people from aligning themselves with you. 

2) it makes compromise impossible by promoting a sports team mentality 

3) it discourages republicans from speaking out against trump 

4) it makes changing hard.  Being demonized for changing is just bad in general 

I understand a healthy amount of skepticism but this idea that just because they are republicans or just because they used to be republicans means they can’t have good ideas imo is dangerous. Am I missing something here? I want to continue to challenge myself to think critically and change my beliefs based on the available evidence, but that is increasingly hard if I am put down for changing.

Tipping should not be expected for takeout orders,"This is inspired from an argument over tipping on pizza takeout orders, but I feel like it applies to all restaurants offering takeout. My points are below.

I tip for services that are provided where I feel the employee/worker generally has to go out of there way to complete that service. Examples are waiters, delivery drivers, hair stylists - people who respond to customer requests and often do additional work. 

I believe takeout orders are a product, not a service. Yes, someone is making the food is the bare minimum work that must be done to create the product that the customer wants. Takeout orders are pre-ordered and usually cannot be altered once put in. Whatever comes through on the ticket is what gets made. The customer comes to the restaurant and picks up the food, requiring no additional work from the staff than what would be required for any other transaction at a business. CMV.

Some points I’ll address that I think may be a counter: 

1. I don’t think packaging the food to go is any additional work. The food would have to be plated if served in house - putting it into takeaway containers is arguably easier.

Edit: this does not apply to pandemic stipulations, I understand the desire/need to tip when indoor dining is shut down.

Edit2: So far I think the best argument is that takeout orders may lead to dissatisfaction with in-house dining, thus leading to lower tips. However I think this is ultimately forcing one customer to make up for another customer (who is requiring more time/attention/service) that understanding tipping to be “a reward” for a good job as opposed to compensation for their service.

Edit3: Clearly plenty of people disagree, but I don’t think tips are expected anymore after reading hundreds of your comments. Let the hate pile on, it is clear many of you are angry at the way society is structured and would like to lay blame and fault at my feet.

Edit4: To all those who continue to comment insults, strawman arguments, and just generally off the mark comments, I suggest you write to your local representatives to advocate for the change you wish to see. Directing your vitriol at a singular man for the woes of society is pathetic and asinine, but many of you have no desire other than to secure your supposed moral high ground while doing nothing to effect real change.",lnkhwg,Cough up a buck ya cheap bastard.,go3pej0,1.5
"Students' grades in the ""gym"" parts of Physical Education should be based on how good they are at the activities, and not the effort that they show.","In S7E1 of Mr D (a Canadian sitcom about, in essence, a phys-ed teacher), Mr D decides to grade his students on their ability at the sports/activities that the class does. This, of course, causes a hilarious uproar among other teachers. Reflecting on this, I think that it is a reasonable approach.

Take, for an example, a mathematics class. On tests and exams, you are predominately assessed on how well you understand the material, and not how much effort you put into learning; a talented but lazy math student could indeed get a much higher grade than a student who puts in a lot of effort but struggles mathematically (for a potential various host of reasons, but that's neither here nor there for this argument).

Why not apply the same logic to the gym portions of phys ed? For starters, it would give students who are academically talented a chance to learn how to struggle and succeed at something that isn't always in their academic wheelhouse. This would build resiliency and develop a strong work ethic among students that may not develop it through a standardized school curriculum. 

Secondly, it gives students that are talented at something besides academics a taste of talent and interest being rewarded. Even if ""gym"" isn't a skill always required in the adult world, giving students a taste of success outside of raw academics would be beneficial for students self esteem.

I am in no way married to this view and I can indeed be convinced otherwise with a strong argument that the ""effort"" based grading is fair and beneficial overall.",s9gbrr,"The problem is that the purpose behind more academic classes is different than the purpose behind gym classes.

The purpose behind gym class is to become more physically fit and act as a baseline requirement for students to live a somewhat active life.

edonism should not be for everyone.,"What I define hedonism as, is the subjective definition of maximizing pleasure or/and happiness.

Now I define myself as being a hedonist at least in term of happiness but that’s irrelevant to this cmv.

The problem with everyone being able to try and achieve a hedonistic mindset is that hedonism is subjective and some genuinely evil people would try to find pleasure in hurting others or worse, it can also be for some an extremely egoistic viewpoint and some historical figures have used it for their own good and stole from the people. Soviet socialism in Eastern Europe had the communist leaders stealing resources from the place for their own happiness. Same is true with North Korea with the Kim family where Kim Jong Un  really focuses on common defense for the country and his own welfare while his country is starving.

Also some psychopaths hedonistic pleasures could also be twisted and same with many other people.

The only real reason why I see myself as hedonistic right now is because I’m for the first time in my life without a big goal and I’ve just gone through a traumatic mental illness that left me in a psychiatric hospital and in the period I had the mental illness I was in constant psychological pain and uncomfortable so this is kinda an period opposite than that maybe as a response to the experience I’ve become a bit hedonistic.

But in regards to hedonism I don’t feel anything positive about hurting others or making harm overall but just make myself happy and my hedonism mostly is just in regards to food and doing exercises since I love that.

Anyways I’ve written a bunch of stuff that’s very irrelevant but what I just want is someone to CMV on the opinion that hedonism isn’t for everyone and can be misused by some to hurt other. Not all people should lead a hedonistic life or strive for it.",dopgxi,"So what you’re saying is that people shouldn’t be allowed to do things that hurt others, almost like we should have a system and laws to prevent such abuses and a set of people charged with enforcing said system?",f5pqhpz,2.0
being non binary has absolutely no meaning,"Before starting, please do not participate in the debate if it's going to be triggering, or you're not going to speak respectfully. If you identify as non-binary, I will address you as such - I am not trying to make anyone uncomfortable, however the nature of my view will unavoidably make people uncomfortable, especially if you are non-binary, and whilst this convo would be best carried out w someone actually non-binary, please do not engage if it's gonna have detrimental effects on your mental health (It's simply not worth it). I am completely open to having my mind changed, my current opinion is based on the evidence that I have been exposed to personally, so please share evidence that would point to the contrary.

Generally, it seems to me that being non-binary doesn't have any actual implications (this is outside of societal discrimination). The definition of non-binary from what I can find online is that you're either no gender or both at the same time. Now this already, seems very contradictory in itself for obvious reasons, as it's essentially a schrodingers cat type of situation. Going into more detail though, the issue I have is that being non-binary seems to have no physical manifestations (as opposed to being trans for example, as trans people tend to change their appearance and behaviour). I am not saying that if you're nonbinary or trans you need to translate that through physical appearance, but I do think there needs to be some kind of practical life change and what not- the absence of this is why I feel that being non-binary is ultimately quite redundant. As with everything else that we choose to identify such as religion, there is always some kind of life change eg. If I say I am a Christian, I probably live my life according to what I believe to be Christian values. I can go on with the examples black people have African decent, gay people are attracted to the opposite sex etc. What makes the person said identity isn't that they just say so - there is an actual implication that comes with it. This doesn't seem to be the case with non-binary people though, the most common answer to my question is just usually because ""I feel like it.""\* Feeling a certain way in this case however, doesn't seem to translate into an objective truth when there is no other presentation of being non-binary if that makes sense? Looking on twitter, there seems to be no pattern within people identifying as non-binary (as opposed to being trans where the pattern is people identifying as the opposite gender and living life accordingly). What I mean is, there is a whole spectrum of people who say they are non-binary, yet still present as very clearly masculine or feminine - what makes these people non-binary other than the fact they say so (eg. a person who was female assigned at birth, wears very feminine clothing but says they're non binary and vice versa for males. Or even female assigned at birth who dresses masculine - how are they different from a tomboy).

\*With that I would also like to make the point that a feeling is a consequence, not a cause (e.g. depressed people are depressed because if a hormone imbalance which causes them to feel said way), so please consider that within a responses.

Now a popular contender for a practical implication of being non-binary is being referred to as they/them. There are several reasons though for why I don't find this convincing. Firstly, not every language has gendered pronouns, such as Hungarian. If being non-binary is just being referred to as they/them, how do u do that for languages that don't make this distinction - what makes a Hungarian speaker non-binary because it's not being referred to as they/them. Furthermore, if you apply this linguistic feature as the sole determiner of gender, you would have to apply this same rule for he/she - as in it should be enough for a transgender person to simply be referred to by their chosen pronoun to fulfil their objectives, yet this is not the case because it's recognised that linguistics are not a good way of implementing change ie. something does not become true just because people say so. Therefore, I am still left w the question, what makes someone non-binary, because it doesn't seem to be their pronouns, nor their lifestyle.

I have also seen now people start identifying as non-binary transfemme etc. Surely this is contradictory - u can't be all genders or neither, whilst at the same time distinguishing a binary (femme) and saying u specifically do align w a gender.

The whole point I'm trying to make here I guess, is that it would make much more sense to use non-binary as an adjective, because it doesn't seem to hold much meaning as a gender identity. For example, David Bowie could be a good example of non-binary as an adjective rather than a gender identity. He was a male, but wore make up, dresses etc, thereby being non-binary as he didn't align to his preset male binary. It would also solve the issue I presented earlier with being non-binary transfemme. If we just considered non-binary to be a term that just says I don't conform to my traditional gender roles, it makes perfect sense that you are non-binary and feminine at the same time.",mbu5nm,"&gt;  The definition of non-binary from what I can find online is that you're either no gender or both at the same time.

Gender is a spectrum so it makes sense thats theres an inbetween point

&gt; Firstly, not every language has gendered pronouns, such as Hungarian. If being non-binary is just being referred to as they/them, how do u do that for languages that don't make this distinction - what makes a Hungarian speaker non-binary because it's not being referred to as they/them

Well yeah you're talking to english speakers so its an issue for gendered languages.

&gt; Furthermore, if you apply this linguistic feature as the sole determiner of gender, you would have to apply this same rule for he/she - as in it should be enough for a transgender person to simply be referred to by their chosen pronoun to fulfil their objectives,

"If you say “billionaires shouldn’t exist,” yet buy from Amazon, then you are being a hypocrite.","Here’s my logic:

Billionaires like Jeff Bezos exist because people buy from and support the billion-dollar company he runs. Therefore, by buying from Amazon, you are supporting the existence of billionaires like Jeff Bezos. To buy from Amazon, while proclaiming billionaires shouldn’t exist means supporting the existence of billionaires while simultaneously condemning their existence, which is hypocritical.

The things Amazon offers are for the most part non-essential (i.e. you wouldn’t die if you lost access to them) and there are certainly alternatives in online retailers, local shops, etc. that do not actively support the existence of billionaires in the same way Amazon does. Those who claim billionaires shouldn’t exist can live fully satiated lives without touching the company, so refusing to part ways with it is not a matter of necessity.

"The popular idea to ""cut negative people out of your life"" isolates the mentally ill and prolongs their suffering","Hi all,

I've grown up in a city where the advice ""cut negative people out of your life"" is extremely common. People often give this as advice when talking about relationships, friendships or even acquaintances. The advice is often unprompted and spontaneous, or it comes out of related discussions.

The reasoning behind this point of view (as far as I can gather), is that we are influenced by the people we surround ourselves by. If we cut out all negative people, we can have a happier life. If all of the people we talk to are positive, then we will become positive. As a result, life will be a lot easier to deal with. It's also more fun and exciting talking to bubbly, happy people than people who seem sad or down.

My practical experience of this advice is as follows. When I or anyone I know is going through a bad time (including mental illness), people will simply stop talking to that person for \~3 - 6 months. The idea is to 'wait out' the negativity, by cutting that person out of your life for the period it takes for them to recover. I have had this done to me and I have done this to other people. In both respects, I feel that the advice has caused great harm.

One of the leading causes of mental illness is isolation, and one of the leading causes of prolonging mental illness is isolation. At the same time, one of the common DIY 'treatments' to many mental illnesses (loosely termed) is socializing and having a strong support network.

I believe that by cutting negative people out of our lives we are either causing mental illness or prolonging mental illness in the people we are cutting out. Another byproduct is the obvious imperative to therefore appear 'happy' at all times. This leads to men (predominantly, as far as I can tell), not talking about their suffering and mental illness. This effect is just as damaging, for the same reasons listed above (we need to share our emotions in order to properly deal with them).

Before you mention it, I know that the common objection to my view will be ""people need to look after themselves"". On the one hand, some people can't handle negative people in their life, for they are suffering themselves. On the other, the negative person should deal with their own issues via psychology etc. The problem with both of these points is again, a strong support system is essential to recovery for many mental illnesses. A psychologist is not always enough on their own.

I am willing to change my view on this. I feel quite negatively about myself and others who have internalized this advice, so if I could change my view I would probably feel better about myself and other people.",m4no4c,"Negative people are otherwise healthy people who, often through selfishness or bitterness, are toxic. Mentally ill people are people who are hurting or suffering. There's a VAST difference. In fact, most mentally ill people aren't going to go out of their way to cause you distress or harm, aren't going to cause you the type of drama often associated with this expression. The expression is for people who talk behind your back, manipulate, use you, are just mean. Mentally ill people (I'm married to one and have a ton of experience with this) are more likely to hide away or become more reclusive when they are hurting. My wife has bipolar disorder and is not negative or toxic but either in a depressive state and barely able to get out of bed or manic and ""fun"" and energetic (and capable of making terrible decisions when it comes to alcohol or money). That's when she's manic or depressive. More often than not, though, she's just worn out from it or doing her damn best to get to her appointments and take her meds and be an awesome mom.

Patriotism is a ploy by the right to be more electable without actually helping the poor,"I've never understood why people care about patriotism, or even precisely what they mean by it. I cannot fathom why someone would have a different opinion of a politician, or anyone, based on how often they stand in front of a flag, or profess to have a deep care for their country. Even if it was sincere, it wouldn't make the slightest difference to the effect their policies have on their country. Obviously this is done by politicians on all sides (e.g. Starmer in the UK), but it seems particularly characteristic of the right, and the right are far more likely than the left to attack the other for being 'unpatriotic' or 'hating their country'.

But these politicians aren't stupid. They know patriotism has no material consequences, and is just a helpful facade that will help them get more votes if they do it effectively. So why would they keep pushing it other than for that? it also seems to me that at times of crisis and scandal, and when politicians and media need to defend things that are particularly indefensible, they defer to patriotism. When the right want to defend why statues of horrible people are proudly on display, they accuse the left of hating their country. When they want to defend why the UK still has a monarchy, they defer to patriotism. When an American politician wants to build support for a war, they make a big display of 'supporting our troops'.

I think the effect of this is that space in the political discourse that could be spent on real issues is wasted. That the voters who understand politics the least get convinced that the other side just wants their country to do badly. That the votes of a fraction of the population is often fought over by mere displays, rather than any policies specifically aimed at helping that fraction. That debate about controversial issues, like how the poppy in the UK has become associated with militarism, get shut down and robbed of nuance, and devolve into meaningless accusations.

It has been pointed out to me that this is quite Western-centric, and I no longer claim this is true of all parts of the world.

Songs like Man in the box, Rooster or down in a hole by AIC have such raw emotion and technical skill involved and I have yet to find a Nirvana song that trumps any 3 of those songs I just mentioned.

"In art there are no specific requirements for quality, thus criticism lamenting the absence of something is invalid.","Quality to me is the amount of great things something has. This sounds a bit stupid but ""great things"" is the most general term I could think of.   
Anything that could entertain you. It could be action scenes or dialogue or just great cinematography.   


So I think in art reviews lamenting the absensce of a specific feature or thing is not valid criticism. For example ""The movie has no character development"". You don't need character development. It's one thing writers can do to make it entertaining. One thing. Out of many possible things they can do. Lots of great movies or even tv shows have no character development.   
Mostly procedural shows.   


And now you're gonna say ""But non procedural shows need character development"". No they don't either. Cause genres are a social construct. It makes no sense that the quality of a thing is dependant of the genre it's generally considered to be a part of. The simpsons could have season spanning story arcs, that wouldn't suddenly mean Homer has to change throughout the series.   


I believe too often people's opinions on art is too much dependant on their expectations. Another example is the game Cyberpunk 2077. Criticism I've heard is that the world feels empty or that the AI is bad.   
But that doesn't make the game bad. They are just things that could have made it better. But the game has many things that make the game good. So it's still great, just not for the same reasons as other games are great.   


TLDR: Quality is the amount of great things something has. It doesn't matter what these things are. Thus saying ""This piece of art does not have this thing"" is not a valid argument in an art review. The only valid argument is ""It does not have enough good things to make it worth consuming"".",lo7xrr,Could you name a movie that is really good without character development?,go7okw6,1.5
"Eliminating financial inequality is impossible, and trying to eliminate it is the wrong approach","\[Disclaimer: I don't have a degree in economics this is just my opinion, I'm sure there are plenty of things I'm not considering, and I'm willing to learn more.\]

My argument is this, in order to enforce equal pay while still incentivizing harder work government is required to mediate the distribution of labor, and therefore the hierarchy is merely rearranged in the government's favor (which because of human nature is ripe for abuse). On the more capitalist side of things, unregulated capitalism can lead to workers being exploited (with wages that don't allow upwards mobility, and access to high quality education being varied and biased towards descendants of the upper classes), and therefore the hierarchy is simply arranged differently and unjustly from a different angle.

I believe that instead of trying to eliminate financial inequality, the better approach is to aim for a system where the average citizen has as similar resources to scale the society's hierarchy as possible. I think in practice this can be achieved with stricter regulations that require all public high schools to reach a higher minimum baseline quality to receive government funding (and for funding to be expanded to account for this). This in order to provide a system where no matter your social class, your children will have the tools to climb the economic hierarchy through their merit (and intelligent moves in the market). (((Outside of tools necessary to develop the competence to even contend in a hierarchy))), I believe the market should be as free as possible (with regulations preventing negative externalities within reason).

It is not unethical of me to pirate a game I have already paid for on another platform.,"Paying full price for a game on one platform should give me this ability to play on another. I am not buying a physical product, I am buying a rights to play a game that I’ve paid for. I should be able to source the game without paying for it again to play on another platform. Paying twice for me to play the same game on 2 platforms is not fair.

I can play the game twice on PlayStation for $79.99, but if I want to play once on PS and once on PC I am obliged to pay $159.98.

Windows games seem to allow cross platform licenses which I consider ethical. This should be, from a morality standpoint, the fair way.

Having to pay double to cross platform is unethical and as I result I should not feel bad for pirating said game.

\-------- EDIT: VIEW CHANGED --------

Thanks to all for the discussion. Consider my view changed. This was down to the fact that I hadn't considered hosting rights on other platforms, or the fact that I may not necessarily want to pay full price for a 2nd copy but it is unethical to consider that no compensation be made for the privilege, and the fact that at the end of the day it is the right of the developer to volunteer this possibility.",gmkxos,"The issue with this is, when you buy a game on playstation, the revenue goes to the game dev, and also sony.

When you buy the same exact game on PC from say, steam, the game dev and valve see the revenue.

so why not give revenue to valve as well? how is that fair?

as someone that plays a multitude of games on all platforms, it would be awesome to buy a game on one, and play it on all the others. but, alas, it just isnt possible. atleast not without raising the price of said game so that even people that are only playing on one platform pay the premium,

Mental health regulation in the gun control debate is irrelevant and would be impossible to implement,"Whenever I see people talk about gun control in the United States, there's always people who take the mental health treatment/ testing route. It's either A) We should have better mental health treatments in general to lower the amount of mentally ill people (who could possibly get a gun and misuse it) or, B) We should require more tests/reports/ investigation surrounding an individual's mental health when they go to get a gun license and inevitably a gun. However, I find this argument to be idealistic and like it comes fron people who don't understand enough about mental illness.

 First of all, better treatment for mental health (better school counselors, cheap/free therapy and medication, raising awareness, etc.) will not eradicate mental illness. Especially not for people who are so ill to the point that they want to shoot up a school. These kind of facilities require the mentally ill individual (or their family who KNOWS that they are mentally ill) to go get help. Many people do not want help, and many people do not trust psychologists and counselors. It's a harsh reality, but many mentally ill people will actively avoid seeking treatment. Someone with a lot of hatred or betrayal in their head is even less likely to seek treatment. A lot of people with mental illnesses don't even think of themselves as being mentally ill. 

As for the second approach, it neglects to address that many times, you cannot get an accurate test from someone that does not want it. Sure, psychology has come a long way— there are many psychologists who can figure out what's wrong with a person even if they lie their asses off. But not all psychologists are that good at their jobs, and not all people find lying hard. Trust me, from personal experience, mental health patients trick their doctors a lot more than people think. The other part of this approach is looking more deeply at medical records as well as crime/school incidents. That would be effective, I agree, but it also doesn't address that sometimes this is the first extreme thing someone will do due to mental health issues, and that if someone never looked for help/did something extreme we will have no records on their mental health. On top of that, there are plenty of perfectly sane individuals who would be denied their rights (not my view, but for the sake of my argument, sane individuals have the right to bare arms) in this scenario because they did something while intoxicated once 5 years ago, or struggled with depression when they were a teenager.

It would also be incredibly hard to implement this all nation wide— in poor towns and rich towns, rural villages and large cities— there's now way we could accurately assess people's mental health statis every single time they get a gun license or a new gun.

That's all— CMV",vzeywj,"Comprehensive mental and emotional health practice isn't just about discovering and treating illness. Treating our emotions as a disease is actually part of the problem. The easiest, most feasible, and most effective approach doesn't involve trying to sort out who needs it and who doesn't. It's to begin early and throughout education with consistent emotional health education and practice. If every kid starts every school day with mindfulness meditation, group discussion, and physical practice like yoga, you'll see marked improvement across the board. And you never have to meet the late intervention goals that you're afraid can't be met. Yes, we need to massively increase the number of school counselors and mental health professionals available to our kids. But we also can start every day teaching The skills that they need to manage and be aware of their emotional well-being. Teaching them how and when to look for support when they are struggling with their emotional well-being. 

And it's not out of reach these aren't subjects that are so complicated that they require specialization to teach. Any educator with a modest amount of training can teach this from a worksheet. Mindfulness meditation can be taught by an app on your phone.

ou can't defend transgenderism and the idea that there is no psychological basis for gender roles at the same time,"The overall social and academic culture seems to be holding two ideas that are so mutuallly contradictory that no matter which assumptions you make, they are inconsistent.

My argument isn't necessarily that one is right and the other wrong, just that you can't pick both, if you assume one you have to reject the other.

Let's make the assumption that humans are blank slates (which is unsupported by the evidence). And so gender is a social construct, it doesn't really exist.

This immediately implies that trans people CAN'T be experiencing discomfort due to biological reasons (otherwise we contradict our assumption). So trans people are merely people that are trying to play gender roles that don't match their sex.

In this case you have two options. Either you assume that gender roles are harmful, and as such we need to do away with them, in which case trans people should be taught the error of their ways and accept that gender does not exist. Or you assume that in spite gender being a construct, it really matters for some XX karyotype people to look and be treated by the role ""man"" and then if they have the right to play the ""man"" role, so does every xy karyotype person. And as such we will continue to have a concept of masculinity and femininity.

Let's on the other end assume that there exist biological differences between men and women that manifest themselves at a psychological level. This explains why trans people exist, they literally have a major disconnect between their brain and their body and as such CAN'T be happy living in a female body and role and NEED to play a male role to be happy. But then if this is true of trans people, it will also be true for every gender conforming person and as such, you can't hold the idea that gender roles are just a product of society.

Once again, I am not arguing that either of these positions is right, I am arguing that they are LOGICALLY INCONSISTENT.

EDIT:

Some people are getting caught up in my use of the word ""exists"". Understand here a materialist approach, it exists if and only if it is material. So, as someone pointed out in a comment, money as a concept does not exist (money as a piece of paper does). Now, that;s not to say that in the mutually agreed practice of money exchange money doesn't have effects on the real world. I am just using a materealistic definition of the word ""exists"" because it makes it easier to talk about ""socially constructed without a biological/physical basis"" and ""built into our DNA/biology (matter)""

EDIT 2:
Based on a comment about me not defining terms.

Sex, the physical characteristics  that emerge due to genetic information (xy karyotype, xx karyotype) + a misc set for all other extraordinary elements (intersex conditions, hormonal anomalities, etc...). I leave it open for you to put as many categories here as you want, as long as we recognize that it is part of a physical expression of genetic information.

Gender, the psychological aspects/traits, be it born from biology or culture, that are expected to be performed from people, loosely correlated with birth characteristics. i.e this is behaviour that is expected from an individual based on the aggregate average of the behaviours of all other individuals that share the same birth characteristics.

Transgender, any individual who based on their sex is statistically expected/predicted to conform to a given gender, but for any reason, takes steps to abide by the characteristics of another gender, which may include the need to modify one's body to conform to the sex is the most highly correlated with the desired gender.

People should be able to show up next to a BLM rally marching for the injustices of their community,"More specifically, people of any cultural background should be able to protest their lives matter along side those of blm. 

For context... Ejaz Choudry, a married father of four who suffered from schizophrenia was shot a killed by officers in Mississauga, ON. He is a Muslim man. Following his death there are nearby protests by those of the Muslim community. My parents, we're Black, came home very ""irritated"" by the inconvenience of the protests. My mom in particular said something along the lines of, ""they're just riding off the BLM wave."" I felt that this line of thought was extremely hypocritical and I shared this with my mom...before someone slanders her, we spoke about it she changed her heart. I'm afraid that her rhetoric may be more common than I hope. 

My mom is a supporter of BLM and that's why her response took me by surprise. Fundamentally ""Black Lives Matter"" is not entirely inclusionary, it's meant to be a message from the black community to government. I can understand that it may cause disinterest in other community causes, but it also isolates our own.

Edit:caption wasn’t very specific

Edit2: after scrolling through social media, I noticed Ejaz Choudrys death doesn’t get the support of #blacklivesmatter. Which makes sense, he’s not Black. Asian countries were also colonized, and looking at them today it’s fair to say many of them continue struggling through their past along with the imposition of first world governments that continue to occupy their land.",hdfoza,"I personally think it is important for the black community to be given their own stage spotlight and be seen and heard as a distinct group. You're right that many of these rallies share commonality in protesting racial injustices / mistreatment by those in authority, but given the trauma that black folks have specifically faced in their communities related to their blackness, I think they should get to have their own platform to speak.

Protesting in specifics (black lives) rather than generalities (all lives) gives the black community a chance to reclaim something specifically taken from them. And I think that's powerful.

Ideally any and every group that faces unequal / discriminatory treatment as a result of their identity &amp; expression should be able to campaign for and assert themselves. What your mom said about how ""they (Muslims) are piggybacking on the BLM movement"" is hurtful because both movements can and should exist at the same time, after all the Muslim and black communities continue to face racism and need their chance to protest and stand up for themselves. It's even better that other communities are rallying for their own causes, now that BLM has gained traction, since the world is being shaken up and starting to listen more carefully now to those voices that were always missed.",fvm5qke,5.0
"Labelling democratic ""socialism"" as socialism has pushed America back at least 5 years","Ok just to make this clear right off the bat, by democratic socialism I'm referring to the kind that Bernie Sanders proposed, which is known as a social democracy according to many other sources. 

My point is that democratic socialism being labelled as socialism has basically linked itself to the many horror stories that have occurred under socialism. Ideally, what is referred to as democratic socialism should have named itself something else entirely, because it literally operates under capitalism. 

I just don't get why they conceded to the name of socialism. The amount of years that were spent in anti-socialist propaganda means that both the democratic party and the entire right hate all of these policies that aren't even socialist or extremist in the slightest.

All adults who wish to learn to draw should first practice scribbling.," 

All adults who wish to learn to draw can draw but first you must start with the practice of scribbling.

I’m a drawing teacher. When I taught my first drawing class, I began by teaching the “normal” ways to learn to draw – see this apple, draw the apple.  
 

But I found that my students struggled. They were frustrated. I watched them closely to see what they needed and realized bit by bit that I had to keep backing up further and further in the drawing process to see what was missing. Strangely, I found that most adults in my classes didn’t know how to scribble.

For example – they didn’t know how to hold a pencil properly, or were stuck in patterns like only scribbling up/down in straight lines, or only drawing circles over and over (even though I didn’t give them any guidance on how to “scribble”).

So, I started teaching people intentionally to scribble freely. I see scribbling to drawing as hearing a beat is to playing a song. Here’s why:

\-it builds muscle memory and hand-eye coordination

\-it encourages people to make their own unique marks on paper, without there being a “right” way to do it 

\-it allows you to get familiar with art materials without worrying about technique

\-it’s a low-barrier way to start

In many fields we talk about learning the “fundamentals”. I think the fundamentals of drawing all begin with scribbling. 

“Natural” artists are just those who scribbled freely enough in childhood to slowly develop a “natural” ability to draw. Without learning to scribble freely, no amount of apple-copying will make anyone feel like they can draw.

Change my view.",fx91ch,"I think the key to learning anything is sustainability and knowing what kind of learning strategy works for you. There’s never going to be a perfect way to learn or a best way to learn. 

Sustainability is just making it fun or at least not feel like work, which you kind of are tackling with scribbles. Now if I was in you class that would make me hate art pretty quickly. That’s not a attack on you i just think differently and need different things. I graduated with a degree in illustration and my favorite teachers were the ones the combined core fundamentals into a steady climb into more complicated things. They created a sense of progress but also able to put themselves in the students shoes and think like them. Projects would have to follow guidelines based on what was demonstrated in class then the student was told to find something fun they wanted to make with in those rules.

"In the medical field, addicts who would like to continue their lifestyle should be allowed to do so.","As I am reading an ethics textbook for school I’ve come across a dilemma. The book talks about allowing the patient to make their own decisions if they are mentally capable of making them for themselves. It also talks about medical providers doing what they can to benefit a patient and improve their quality of life with as little risk possible. That being said, as someone who works as an EMT I have had numerous patients who are addicted to drugs, alcohol, etc who can answer my questions and make their own decisions. One of the decisions I see them commonly express either verbally or through violence toward the provider is that they do not want help and want to continue living their lives they way they choose to. I can’t force treatment upon a person nor do I think it is very effective if they do not want it for themselves. So, as long as a person is not a harm to others, why bother helping someone who is harming themselves and wants to continue? I promise I’m not a monster, I just find these views in medical ethics to be somewhat contradictory when the provider is supposed to do everything in their power to help a person while respecting the patients preferences. How does a medical provider help if the person is of sound mind but clearly killing themselves? Is it morally and ethically correct for the provider to respect the patients decision to do nothing or would it be more correct to forcefully care for them knowing it will at least improve their physical condition?",hjxfr8,"Can you really say they are fit to make their own decisions, when they’re going through withdrawal and they would basically do anything to get the drug they need?

"US Democrats should push for a higher minimum wage in blue states, not at the federal level","So once again democrats are pushing for a $15 an hour federal minimum wage. They probably have the votes in the house, the president will sign off on it, but it seems somewhat unlikely that it will get past the senate. I think you could make a reasonable argument that most of America wants this increase, after all the democrats hold a pretty big majority in the house, which is elected in proportion to population. Where it's failing is in the senate, which was in part created to prevent states with large populations from imposing their will on states with small populations.

To me this seems like a case of everything working as intended. There's a policy that's widely supported but whose popularity depends quite heavily on what state you're looking at. The solution is to bypass the US senate and enact the policy in states whose voters elected representatives who actually want it. I counted nineteen states that have democratic majorities in both the house and senate, sixteen of which also have a democratic governor. None of these states have a $15 an hour minimum wage, which seems surprising given that their voters are largely responsible for electing the federal representatives who would make it a nationwide policy. Twenty three states have republican majorities in the house and senate, plus republican governors. They represent a minority of the population, but they clearly don't want this policy.

To me the solution seems obvious. Stop trying to force the $15 an hour minimum wage on states that don't want it, and enact it in blue states right away. You'll cover most of the US population and the change will be concentrated in places that actually want it. Minimum wage by state or even by county seems like a better solution anyway because it can be indexed to the cost of living. You need a lot more to get by in NYC or Seattle than you do in a small town in Mississippi.",lw6204,United States Democrats don't want a higher minimum wage they just want to look like they want it ther like the opposite of a cat,gphb9ib,2.0
It's okay to not like someone/not associate with someone because of their politics,"Over and over again I constantly hear from people that it's close-minded to not want to be friends with someone who holds an opposing political viewpoint to you and that there are many relationships (platonic and romantic) that can transcend politics. Personally, this has never made sense to me. The way I see it, your politics are a reflection of your values and what you consider important in this world. I honestly cannot think of a better reason to not want to associate with someone than a difference in political ideology (other than them like murdering your mom or something). I think it's totally valid to not want to be friends with a republican or a democrat especially when there is such a division between the two parties and their beliefs and values are just so different. I don't think it's ""bad"" when a democrat says they would never be friends with a Trump supporter. Why should they be?? And why are people constantly demonized for only associating with people they agree with? Again, to clarify, I'm specifically talking about friendships/relationships, not just talking with people that hold opposing viewpoints. I think it's always important to hear out the other side and not be stuck in an echo chamber, but again, why do we all have to be friends? I'd really love to hear other people's opinions about this and how they maintain relationships with people who are just so different from them, especially when I think we can all agree this difference is a little more major than something like cat-lover vs dog-lover.",gtlrnp,"So I think the issues comes from not political issues but human rights issues.

It isn't possible to rationally change someone's view about their moral convictions,"Some agent x rationally changes their view about some proposition p iff either

* · x believes some evidence E, x is shown that either p is inconsistent with E or entails some q that is inconsistent with E.
* · x believes some set of evidence E, and x is shown that q explains the evidence better than p.

**Primary claim:**It is not possible to rationally change someone’s view about a moral claim which they hold with sufficiently high conviction.

Sufficiently high conviction:x holds p with sufficiently high conviction iff x subjective credence of belief for p is sufficiently high (as an arbitrary cutoff, let’s say between 0.75 and 1)

Assumption:The individuals that I speak of are ones that are sufficiently reflective, have some familiarity with the major positions in the literature, and subjected their own views to at least some moderate criticism.  They don't have to be professional ethicists, but they're not undergrads taking intro to ethics for the first time.

**The argument:**

1. It is possible that for any agent x, x rationally changes their view about some moral claim p that they hold with sufficiently high conviction iff there is some E such that p is inconsistent with E or some other claim better explains p.
2. There is no E such that x accepts E with greater conviction than p and E is either inconsistent with p or there is some other claim that better explains E.
3. Therefore, it is not possible that for any agent x, x rationally changes their view about some moral claim that they hold with sufficiently high conviction.

Can premise #2 be true of x and x still be rational? Yes. Consider the following familiar thought experiment.

Suppose a hospital has five patients that are in desperate need of an organ transplant. Each patient needs an organ that the other four don’t need. If they don’t receive a transplant in the near future then they will all certainly die. There is a healthy delivery person in the lobby. You can choose to have the person kidnapped and painlessly killed, and then have this person’s organs harvested in order to save the lives of the five patients. What is the morally correct thing to do? Do nothing, or have the delivery person kidnapped?

The right answer to this thought experiment is irrelevant. Instead, we note that according to a standard utilitarian, you are morally obligated to have the delivery person kidnapped and killed in order to save the five patients. According to a typical Kantian, you are morally obligated NOT to kidnap the delivery person, even though by not doing so, you let five people die.

Since the utilitarian and the Kantian hold contrary positions, they disagree. Is it possible for one to change the other’s mind? No. The reason is that not only do they disagree about cases like the one mentioned above, but they also disagree about the evidence given in support of their respective positions. For a utilitarian, considerations involving outcomes like harm and benefit will outweigh considerations involving consent and autonomy. For the Kantian, consent and autonomy will outweigh reasons involving harm and benefit. Which is more important? Harm and benefit, or consent and autonomy? Are there further considerations that can be given in support of prioritizing one over the other? It is not clear that there are any, and even if there were, we can ask what reasons there are for holding the prior reasons, and so on until we arrive at brute moral intuitions. The upshot here is that for philosophically sophisticated, or at least sufficiently reflective individuals, moral views are ultimately derived from differing brute moral intuitions. These intuitions are what constitutes E for an individual, and there is no irrationality in rejecting intuitions that are not yours.

Everything said here is consistent with claiming that it is certainly possible to change someone’s view with respect to their moral beliefs via some non-rational means. Empathy, manipulation, social pressure, and various changes to one’s psychology as a result of environmental interaction can certain change one’s view with respect to one’s moral beliefs, even ones held in high conviction. This is all well and good as long as we are aware that these are not **rational** changes to one’s belief.",lmc6v9,"It's possible to change someone's metaphysical convictions (e.g. who they are, what the universe and life is) and their epistemological convictions (e.g. how they know what they know).

I do believe many pro-life and pro-choice people could be misogynistic, intentionally or unintentionally, but I don’t think that it’s necessarily misogynistic to be pro-life if you only believe that abortion is murder because life begins at conception.

Although, I am open to the possibility that there is some angle that makes this simple pro-life view hypocritical.

For the record I am pro-choice. This isn’t an argument about the merits of aborting unwanted babies, the morals of late term abortions, or the science behind when life begins. This is an argument about the intention behind the stance that abortion is murder and the value of the stance that pro-life is about controlling women.

"Banning Porn Outright is Obviously a Bad Idea, but more should be done to keep children from finding internet porn.","Title is pretty self-explanatory. I am not anti-porn, I want to be very clear on that. I've watched porn for years and I think it's a perfectly acceptable thing for adults to watch porn. Obviously some people can become addicted and like any addiction this can be a problem.The problem with porn is that it is way too accessible, which means children of younger and younger ages are watching porn. I was first exposed to porn at age 12 and started actively watching it around 14, which is later than most kids these days. Anyone can go to pornhub and immediately have access to hardcore pornography. Anyone can find hardcore porn on Twitter or Reddit with a simple search, or even straight from Google. There is virtually no protection in place to keep young children from finding and watching pornography, and there's no way that this isn't damaging.And I want to be clear I'm talking about hardcore pornography. Obviously a 12-yr-old is probably not scarred for life after seeing some boobs, but kids definitely lack the context for gang-bangs and BDSM, not to mention incest-fetish porn which is incredibly mainstream and common now.I've also seen a disturbing trend in porn that the scenarios seem targeted toward younger and younger people. A lot of the set-ups for professional porn seem more relatable to underage boys than grown men. Given the statistics on the young ages that people see porn, it's foolish to think they aren't targeting children with the content, after all, when do kids get hooked on cigarettes? Porn is the same.  
Tl;dr, I'm not saying porn should not be available for adult use, but I think we need better tools to keep porn away from kids. Obviously the industry profits a lot off of kids, so it will not regulate itself. Feel free to argue against any part of this or come up with ideas of regulations that could be effective, obviously short of banning porn.

EDIT: Blaming the parents is naive. Should parents monitor their kids online habits and make sure they have a context for porn and an understanding that it is not reality? Yes. Will most parents do this before their kids find online porn? No. You can blame individuals for their individual problems, but the accessibility of online porn is a societal issue that we need to address as a society.",e9pji5,i move thaat we change the porn industry as a whole to be educational and more normalized. it would lose its sexy mystique that way.,fan91qv,2.0
"The European-style ""free"" higher education proposed by Bernie, among others, would never work in the US.","I'm quite liberal but I think that this is a unattainable goal for a number of reasons, primarily:

1. American College culture. Americans expect and place value on the college experience, and that costs a ton of money. Dorms, stadiums, sports teams, Greek life, drama clubs, student newspapers, political/religious/hobby groups, paid guest speakers. European Universities have much more of a focus on pure academics and cost much less as a result.

2. The American desire for everyone to go to college. No matter what you end up doing, everyone still wants to go to college, and most parents strive to send to send them, and rarely accept a trade as an acceptable and equal option. Most of the kids that go to college here in Switzerland do so with the goal of a career that necessitates higher education. (sciences, medicine, etc). The rest go to trade schools or enter apprentiships in their teens.

Any attempt at making this idea workable will have to be focused on making colleges more selective and less of a necessity for the average American, and will be met with a massive bipartisan outcry far worse than what was seen during the Obamacare debate.",ekdjrc,"Unless a massively larger college infrastructure is created, colleges won't be able to educate more people than they do today. 

And what would be the incentive to build all that infrastructure if it weren't for the ridiculous amount of money people are willing to pay for college because college costs are so completely unregulated?

""Free"" college is not going to be paying for all these bells and whistles, and it's going to be subject to regulation on how much colleges can charge. One would hope that college payments would become based on *outcomes* as well. 

As a consequence, supply and demand will actually work to make colleges *more* selective than they are today. 

""Free"" doesn't mean ""everyone gets to go"", it means ""for the people that qualify, they don't pay upfront, but rather in taxes down the line"". 

The *reason* not everyone goes to college in Europe is *exactly* that it's completely free or heavily subsidized. The *consequence* of that is that it's much more *selective* and you have to actually be *good* to get into college. 

Kids in Europe don't just ""decide to go into a trade""... they fail to *qualify* for college-prep high schools and therefore have no other choice. 

Of course, we'd need to make trade schools much more prevalent and accessible (too many trades today are inaccessible to people because of nepotistic ""apprentice"" arrangements).

MMORPG's are not nearly as addictive as people make them out to be,"Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG's) and their counterparts Massive Online Battle Arena's are not nearly as addictive as people make them out to be.

gifted high school entrance should be based on objective test scores only,"if you're a resident of NYC like i am, you might be familiar with the debate that's been occurring here for a few years now ever since the mayor and school chancellor started bringing it up. if you're not, the situation is that there are 8 specialized (or gifted) high schools that require certain scores on a standardized test before being admitted. if you don't get a high enough score for one of these gifted high schools, you are enrolled in your zoned high school. for the purposes of this CMV, i'll focus on the top rated school, stuyvesant, but most of the gifted schools have the same issue more or less.  

that issue is the racial disparity in these gifted schools. at stuyvesant a recent class of 800, 1% was black, 3% was hispanic, 19% was white and a whopping 74% was asian. 

city-wide, the breakdown of public school students is 41% hispanic, 26% black, 16% asian and 15% white. (a big chunk of the city's white kids goto private school). 

given the wide racial disparity, you may conclude that there is something fishy going on with regards to racial discrimination whether overt or not. the mayor and schools chancellor have stated a preference to eliminate the standardized test in favor of a more holistic approach taking into account other more subjective factors (such as teacher recs) in determining admission as well as offering automatic admission to top grade getters at each of the city's middle schools. 

as a parent of a child who will be attending public school (god-willing in person) in the near future, i have considered this carefully and have come to the conclusion that it would be wrong to change the current method of admission. some priors of mine worth mentioning:

- i believe fair access to school is a near fundamental right
- the idea of having gifted programs/schools can be good and bad but on the balance is much more on the side of good
- access to these gifted schools should be as meritocratic as possible
- gifted programs should maintain the highest academic standards possible
- practicality is an important factor in making anything happen in this city. the biggest thing here is that the population will likely not accept much higher taxes (they are high already) or power grab by the mayor (away from the city council or state). 

here are some arguments (and counter-points) of the pro ""get rid of the test"" camp. 

1\. the test is either overtly or covertly racist/classist. 

* the test, as i know it, is comprised of a math section and a reading/revising (ie. english) portion. i don't know how math questions can be racist so i will skip over that, but i can see how in certain ways an english question could potentially be racist or classist. for instance, if a reading passage is about yachting, it'd be more unlikely that a black kid from harlem will be familiar with yachting terms rather than a white kid from battery park city. but as far as i know, this was brought up decades ago and the test has gone through many revisions to eliminate this kind of bias as much as possible. now no process is 100% fool-proof but given the scrutiny this issue has received over the years, i find it difficult to believe any significant issue of this type still exists in the test today. in my mind, the test itself is not racist. it is as objective as possible in determining aptitude in math and english. 

2\. kids with means who get tutors have an unfair advantage.

* it is true that the affluent have the ability to hire one-on-one tailored tutoring and test prep, giving them a sizable advantage. however two things make this moot for me. first, the city has offered through partners free test prep for any student who needs it (there may be a means-test, i'm not sure). second, something approaching 50% of stuyvesant students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. this indicates to me that money is not the be-all/end-all factor that others think. 

3\. admittance should not be based on a single test for *X* reason

* i totally agree that a child's full potential or aptitude can NOT be captured by a single exam on a single day. however, given there are over a million students in nyc (and around 100k matriculating into hs each year) it would take a monumental increase in bureaucracy to handle the evaluation and admission decisions of that many students. it would also introduce subjective factors which i believe would open the process up to unfair bias and abuse. a standardized test is the most objective method of determining admission that is reasonably practical. the proposal that top grade getters would automatically gain admission is tempting on its face, but grades at each school are still dependent on subjective factors that could easily jeopardize the academic standards of the schools. also, it's my belief that this idea will not dramatically change the racial makeup of these schools, as it is likely that some families with the means will move to certain schools to try and secure those top spots. 

4\. the current situation of racial disparity needs to be fixed

* this one i totally agree with, but what i disagree on is the methods used to fix it. the ones who want to switch from the test argue that the test point is where the issue needs to be fixed, whereas i think it is just the symptom of the problem and not the underlying cause. while the exact cause may be difficult to pin down, i think it is clear that it starts earlier. disparities in resources/wealth/race between schools and districts cause divisions and can hamper a kid's potential down the line. universal pre-k was one step in the right direction (one of the very few things i can give de blasio credit for) and i expect that it will equalize the racial disparities to a minor degree down the line. but more efforts towards real school integration would be a bigger catalyst to fix this situation.


it's a complex issue and i've gotten into many heated arguments about this, so would be happy to discuss (in good faith) and maybe CMV.

*edited for some typos*",il8k6z,"&gt; first, the city has offered through partners free test prep for any student who needs it 

When I lived in NYC (this was 5 years ago) I volunteered as an SAT tutor through one of the programs offering free SAT prep to low income students in Harlem, and I can tell you based on my experience with this program, which was not one-on-one and was mostly volunteers, compared to my experience with my own SAT prep (which was paid and one-on-one), that the free program was a much lower quality (even though we did raise SAT scores significantly). Though I understand this is anecdotal and not related to the specific tests you're discussing, and maybe these programs have changed in function in the last 5 years such that private tutoring and district subsidized tutoring aren't that different in quality.

&gt; something approaching 50% of stuyvesant students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. this indicates to me that money is not the be-all/end-all factor that others think. 

Yet 70+% of all NYC students qualify for free or reduced price lunch. So no, obviously money is not the be-all/end-all, but it *is* absolutely a factor.

I honestly don't know how I feel about the overall view of this because it's so complicated, but I just wanted to pipe up and say I disagree that income doesn't make a significant difference in who gets into the gifted high schools.

Treating healthcare workers as heroes promotes a warlike mentality that these deaths are unavoidable and a heroic sacrifice, while in reality they’re caused by the incompetence of mostly right wing governments.

Especially when you consider that it could be a better option to simply make vaccines mandatory. It would have the same effect but much fewer negative consequences.

If your parent is charged with child abuse, in most countries that would mean the child would be taken away from its parents. Just this fact is already going to traumatise the child because obviously while what it's parents are doing is harmful, it is with good intentions so the child would not hate it's parents and would still want to live with them. After being taken from its parents, it would either have to live with a relative which isn't always possible or go into care. Being in a care home is absolutely not a good thing as a child - no parents, very little money spent on you, no love and affection. Then they would have to go between foster homes, not having a stable home and not having any adults that truly care about them. Sure they could get adopted but there is a massive shortage of parents willing to adopt so depending on the country this isn't always likely. 

The stats for the outcomes of kids leaving foster care are terrible. For example: this report shows that of children leaving care (which includes those who were adopted), 39% have emotional problems that are a ""cause for concern"" https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/757922/Children_looked_after_in_England_2018_Text_revised.pdf. there are lots of other bad statistics on that report if you're curious. What I'm saying is you don't want to go into care unless absolutely necessary.

"""Free speech"" is not primarily a legal concept. It means something more than freedom from prosecution for what you say.","This view is the opposite of [this XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1357/) comic.  Free speech is being extensively debated at the moment, particularly in reference to the actions of social media companies.   Critics of social media companies argue that various actions (this is not about any of those in particular) violate free speech.  This often triggers the response (like the comic) that free speech under the first amendment doesn't regulate private behavior, only government behavior.

That's true as a legal matter, but my view is that when people use the term ""free speech"", they generally aren't referring to the narrow protections of the first amendment.  Instead, they are referring to a more general philosophical principle or human right.  That is, the concept of ""free speech"" is not mostly a legal one and instead stands in for a view that people shouldn't be punished or censored for expressing views or ideas in general. (Edit: I phrased this poorly originally, I don't mean to suggest an unlimited right; there are tons of limitations on the right to expression and this is just meant to indicate that generally, in the absence of factors like hate speech, fighting words, and so on, there is a right to express oneself).  In this sense, it is perfectly reasonable to talk about Facebook violating someone's right to free speech by censoring them (though any given claim to that effect can be debated).

Allowing the private actors who operate open, general, and primarily unmoderated communications systems to censor at their own sole discretion threatens everyone's freedom of speech (in the broader sense rather than than the narrow legal one) because having access to such means of communication is essential to actually ""speaking.""  On a philosophical (rather than legal) level, suggesting that Twitter can ban people or censor content on a political basis at its own discretion is the same as suggesting that Twitter can deny service to black people, or Jews, or women, at its own discretion.

As a society, we should legitimately concerned about censorship by private actors who control communications media.  All of the limits are subject to debate, but the bottom line is that it's reasonable to suggest that there's an underlying value of ""freedom of speech"" that applies to Twitter's actions just as well as the governments in the same way that ""freedom of religion"" doesn't just mean that you can't be prosecuted for your beliefs, it also means that a private employer can't fire you for them.

I can think of a few ways to change this view:

1. Demonstrate that when people talk about ""free speech"", they are mostly referring to the specific protections of the first amendment rather than an underlying philosophical value.
2. Demonstrate that there's no basis for societal concern about private acts of censorship.
3. Demonstrate that there's some consequential moral/philosophical difference between Twitter blocking people for their political views and Twitter blocking people on the basis of race/gender/religion.
4. Probably other ways I'm not thinking of ... that's what makes CMV interesting.

Please note that I'm not offering any view on particular recent actions, nor am I asserting that Twitter in fact blocks people on the basis of their political views.  This view is about whether or not it's reasonable to talk about a right of free speech that has consequences for the actions of private actors.

Edit: Further clarification, I am not suggesting an unlimited right to speech, and this view isn't about the limits on that right.  The view here is about the fact that a philosophical concept of ""free speech"" (whatever the limits of said concept) is applicable to the actions of private actors.",kve8u1,"I think from a philosophical perspective this is an interesting question because it is such a new concept. 50 years ago the only way to communicate was through spoken word, telephone, print, or letter. There was never a question about whether private companies could censor people. Except in the case of anti-discrimination protections, private companies and employers had basically full control over the speech that occurred on their property or on their platforms (such as TV, radio, and print). You weren't entitled to anything and had very little protection or regulations. There were laws about defamation, and obscenity, and that was about it. The one exception is that the service providers could not moderate the content of your phone calls or your letters. But they also were not liable for it's contents.

So today, the question has become to what extent has the internet, and by extension social media companies, change this landscape? On the one hand nobody would deny the immense social and communication changes they have brought to the masses. But on the other hand, they are still private companies and are just offering a service. 

I think most people would agree some changes need to happen. There is no doubt the internet companies do enjoy a disproportionate influence on communication. It's no longer effective to stand on a street corner and hand out leaflets anymore like the 1960s anymore... your message will be dwarfed by one person with an instagram and 10,000 followers. So I do appreciate the concerns of conservatives that are de-platformed. There are large barriers in the form of monopolistic competition to creating your own communication platform. But it is possible and it is your right. 

In fact, progressives support this concept which is why they support net neutrality... to ensure that anyone can access the internet even when the ISP has a monopoly over internet service. This is pretty consistent with how we have treated telephones and the postal service in the past. 

So which box do social media companies and other services compare? In some ways they are peer to peer communication like mail. In other ways they allow users to broadcast messages to a wide variety of people. A hallmark of these services is that I, the user, can block content I don't want to see. I think we can all agree that is a good thing. Just like how I can toss spam mail or block a phone number, I can block users and content I don't like. But as the services become more complex that becomes more difficult. What if I as a user don't want to see any curse words or porn? This forces the service to start monitoring and moderating content. Otherwise you get something like 4chan where you can get spammed with undesirable content. This also points to a problem with social media companies... users (and advertisers) like a clean site with nice content and lots of features... if the 4chan model was desirable and profitable it would be much more successful than it is now. So there is a strong incentive to allow services to have the freedom to make good business decisions. Afterall, nobody is forcing Twitter and Facebook to moderate... they could just as easily stop moderating. But they don't because it's bad for business and it's not what their users want. 

The problem in my mind is that some people (at this time conservatives) want to essentially regulate private companies in a way that forces them to provide a platform for all speech (or at least all legal speech). This is kind of an ironic concept because forcing someone to host certain speech is actually a 1st amendment violation. So they essentially want to violate the 1st amendment in order to secure free speech. Kind of an oxymoron if you ask me. I don't like this solution for that reason, because depending on how it is implemented (like with Trump's proposal) it could give the government the power to determine which speech is acceptable, and which should be moderated or banned. 

TBH I also think it's just kind of premature. People act like Facebook and Twitter and Instagram are giant monopolies with unlimited power, when in reality they are already struggling to remain relevant. Facebook is losing users, youtube can't turn a profit, snapchat and dozens of others came like a hurricane and failed just as fast. We have to consider the long term consequences of any speech laws. I don't think the Parler situation is as dire as it seems... it's obvious why it failed...it's user base consisted of all the people that were too abusive for all the other platforms. It's not conservative voices being booted, it's a minority of extreme voices. 

I'm not exactly sure what the best solution is. I obviously support net neutrality when it comes to ISPs. I think rather than forcing companies to create a certain product, we should probably focus on trust-busting and lowering barriers for competition. Parler was actually a good example, but if their business model relied on breaking the rules then they should have probably set themselves up another way. If you want to see how an industry can flourish even when they are shut out of traditional institutions, just look at the cannabis industry.",giyazov,4.5
Cynicism is a way to defend yourself against complexity and having to put in effort,"I just listened to a lecture by the philosopher Rick Roderick, who lectures on the history of philosophy. He said something i found very profound, and would like to paste his quote here. It's a bit long, but please read!

(...)"" The lives of our society is a generalised cynicism and scepticism about **everything**. I don’t know how to characterise this situation, I find no parallel to it in human history. The scepticism and cynicism about everything is so general, and I think it’s partly due to this thing I call banalisation, and it’s partly due to the refusal and the fear of dealing with complexity. Much easier to be a cynic than to deal with complexity. Better to say everything is bullshit than to try to look into enough things to know where you are. Better to say everything is just… silly, or pointless, than to try to look into systems of this kind of complexity and into situations of the kind of complexity and ambiguity that we have to deal with now.

I hope using a quote as a base of a CMV is allowed. Basically what Rick Roderick (passed away in 2002) was saying is that some things can seem overwhelming, so complex, daunting or difficult that one is put off from doing whatever it is, philosophy, goals in life, perhaps existence itself.

I would like to add that cynicism is also a way to defend yourself against having to put in effort. If you have a goal and it seems a struggle to get, and you imagine in your mind the effort and strain it will take, it is better to put it down right away then use effort and fail.

Now, i do not claim that nothing is actually difficult, that people have gone through horrible ordeals. But overall i feel that this sort of cynicism is reaching dangerous levels in society. And Rick does not give any answers to this either.",dp9olq,"Roderick frames cynicism as a defense mechanism, as a kind of willful ignorance in reaction to fear of the complex, as though there are too many choices so cynicism is an excuse to not make any. I think this is dead wrong. Cynicism is not a reaction to fear, it's a reaction to oversaturation, it's a symptom of expertise. 

I recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2doZROwdte4). It frames the issue of cynicism in terms of postmodernism, not as a stubborn resistance to complexity but as natural reaction to over saturated markets. I'm guessing the ""banalisation"" Roderick refers to is another way to address the obscene wealth of choices that we have. I think the impact of every choice we make is diluted by every extra choice we're offered. So they all start to look banal. 

In the video David Foster Wallace talks about cynicism as a symptom of cultural expertise. We've seen it all, so it's hard to fool us, and the market is so flooded with attempts to fool us that the default reaction is doubt. In other words, discerning to a fault. The video makes a larger point about how cynicism has itself been appropriated and regurgitated to the point that the cynics have to be cynical about cynicism, so we're fleeing back to sincerity, with a self aware twist. It's all rather bizarre and fascinating how culture constantly folds in on itself.

Bottom line, I think cynicism is useful as an anti-snake oil. The world is saturated with people trying to sell you junk, and you've seen enough to know quality when you see it, so treat everything as snake oil until you see otherwise. There's little fear of missing the real thing when you see it. The trick is not to get so ahead of yourself as to stop looking.",f5tuymy,4.666666666666667
"people who are against abortion, or other types of procedures based on their personal beliefs should not be allowed to become doctors/surgeons","What I mean by this is once you do the Hippocratic Oath, you’ve sworn to try to save any and all lives. If you have a personal belief that prevents you from fully committing to the profession, you should not be allowed to be a professional doctor or given any tasks where it would require you to do these things. Or as a matter of fact have any possibility to do those things.

I may have somethings mixed up in my head about how procedures go in training people like this but overall you should not have a right to choose who you are saving because their this or that.",e17s4j,"IIRC, doctors and surgeons don't perform abortions, abortionists do.

Nudity is sexual,"I feel like a lot of places I go on the internet there’s nude bodies, or naked candles, or photos of naked people, and people say that they aren’t sexualized, and I just don’t understand that at all, like, how is it not sexual? We basically do only 3 things when we’re naked, change clothes, shower, and have sex, which one do we do most often? Definitely not changing, twice a day, let’s say 2 minutes each is 4 minutes, so basically nothing, I’m not sure exactly how much people have sex but I’m guessing every 1-3 days, and I’m guessing the average is 10-15 minutes, and I’m guessing the average shower length is around that as well, we shower every day aswell, so yes technically sex isn’t the most common thing we do while naked, but still, it isn’t too far behind, and showers can be sexualized, many people have sex in the shower (although not a majority) and lots and lots of people think that bodies covered in water is hot.

So, basically when you’re naked, it’s mostly sexual, so then how is a nude not sexual? I just don’t get it, I want to be more respectful, but I just don’t understand it wouldn’t be sexualized.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: Thank you to everyone who responded! You changed my view, yeah I probably need to get outside more and actually realize not everyone views nudity as a sexual thing",vbqphf,"It's not that nudity isn't sexual, it's that it's not _inherently_ sexual.  Just a few centuries ago, showing your ankles as a lady was considered sexual and something that prostitutes or strippers did.  I don't think I would get a boner from looking at someone's ankles? Do you?  But back then, it was very sexual.  It's all cultural, not inherant. Another example would be babies. I sure hope most people aren't thinking about sex when they're changing their baby.

There is something that is inherently sexual, however, and that is people in general.  People can see sex in anything. I practically had a non-stop boner when I was a teen.",ic9vizt,3.5
"""It is not antisemitic to criticize Israel"" does not need to be said, and I'm suspicious of people who do say it.","Commonly in discussions surrounding the Israel/Palestine conflict, people who are critical of Israel insist that it is not antisemitic to criticize Israel. I think that most reasonable people agree with this already, and it does not bear repeating. No major Jewish group says that it is antisemitic on the face of it to criticize Israel, nor can I find prominent examples of people being tarred as antisemites merely for making reasonable criticisms of the state. I have however, had [multiple](https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/lkmrjl/cmv_we_have_to_separate_antisemitism_and/) [conversations](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/l5lmro/cmv_that_opposing_and_criticising_israel_isnt/) on this sub where OP has vaguely gestured that it's common to be accused of antisemitism merely for criticizing Israel. [This](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/mar/07/debunking-myth-that-anti-zionism-is-antisemitic) article argues against the ""myth"" that criticizing Israel is antisemitic. All very fair, I just can't find anybody actually propogating the myth. Who is saying that it is antisemitic to criticize Israel? There are plenty more articles in this vein. It seems like we have tons of people ""debunking"" a myth that nobody actually believes.

I'm suspicious that people saying this are trying to either poison the well, and get their interlocutors to think that pro-Israel people reflexively play the ""Jew card"", or that the person saying it *is* antisemitic and ""doth protest too much"".


TL;DR: It isn't antisemitic to be critical of Israel, but loudly insisting that it isn't is a bit sus.

EDIT: I do not believe that saying ""X was called an antisemite unjustly"" meaningfully disagrees with the view. Of course some criticisms of Israel will be called antisemitic, and others will disagree with those characterizations. I'm saying that nobody prominent believes that criticism of Israel is in principle antisemitic. Just giving an example of them calling something antisemitic does not satisfy that. Same as someone pointing out a white swan does not entail that that person believes that all swans are white.",llgff6,"If you have to say I'm not anti Semitic before your argument you seem anti Semitic, like saying I'm not racist but",gnq3rmz,1.5

I realize that this is how they're often characterized in TV and movies and I don't have much experience with them directly, having actively avoided them during my own college experience because of this belief. I also recognize that young women's activities of all kinds are typically derided and regarded as silly or inconsequential no matter what they do, so I'm wondering if this belief has any truth to it or is just sexist bullshit.",iv1grp,"Do you have the same belief about fraternities?

"It is not fun to do things you’re bad at, and your time is better spent improving things for which you have a natural talent.","     I know I’m wrong in my viewpoint but I can’t seem to change my own mind. 
I believe that no one enjoys the feeling of being bad at something, but people have enough things they’re naturally good at that I should never spend time doing things I’m bad at and instead focus on improving things for which I have a knack for. 

     This isn’t about life skills or things that you are eventually forced to learn (cooking, finding motivation to do work...) but mostly fun things. Why would I spend time learning a video game I know I won’t pick up quickly when I know I can play one I will pick up quickly? Why waste my time slightly improving at a sport I’m really bad at when I could find a different one that comes easier?

     My boyfriend says that it can be fun to improve at something you’re bad at, but I never knew people actually felt that way. I thought that was something your teacher says in 3rd grade to make you feel better about not knowing cursive yet. I’m convinced no one actually has fun practicing something they’re bad at; it doesn’t feel good to lose/fail over and over again, only to see marginal improvement. 

     That being said, I think I’ve suffered from having this viewpoint. I took a hard math class my first year at university, didn’t do great, and decided I was no longer good at math and there was no point in trying to learn more because I wasn’t smart enough to do it anymore. All throughout high school I was great at math and considered it my strongest subject. Now, I’m about to graduate with an engineering degree and have never felt more insecure in my math skills in my life; I’ve convinced myself that I’ve hit my cap on learning math and I no longer have the ability to learn it (at least at any significant pace). 

     I believe there’s no point in doing something you’re bad at, because it feels bad and improvement is marginal and slow. It’s better to find things you show a natural talent for, and practice those until you’re great, and have fun while doing it. Change my mind (please!!)",herzv5,"I know you've tried to say you're not talking about ""life skills"" with this post, but that's not what your example of being hurt by your worldview reflects. You gave up the chance to learn a valuable skill extremely relevant to your career and did the bare minimum because it wasn't fun - I feel this demonstrates your belief applies to life skills also, even if you aren't admitting it to yourself.

In this response, I will assume this belief applies to any skill that you want to invest in for the long-term, for fun or for professional reasons. I want to briefly tackle two assumptions in your beliefs here about these things:

- Difficult things are useless to do in the short-term. Playing a difficult video game is hard and improvement is slow - so, in the short term, why bother?

- Easy things help you much more than difficult things in the long-term. If you can be the best at being a concert pianist because of natural ability, who cares if you're a lousy flautist? 

Both of these assumptions are problematic. 

--- 

The second assumption is the most problematic one because it is flawed on multiple levels:

-  *The more effort you have to put into something you enjoy, the less you end up enjoying it*. 

Learning ballet for fun is one thing. Doing ballet professionally is a hellish experience: you train for multiple hours a day, until your limbs are exhausted and you can't think straight, and you still end up being terrible because now you're competing against the best ballet dancers in the world and you can't afford to be off even a little bit.

If you only do things because they're fun, at some point you will refuse to grow because the amount of effort you have to do to remain competitive or relevant in them stops being fun - and that's terrible, because what happens if you've invested in that as your career? What happens the first time you hit a snag in your relationship  with your significant other? Beware of becoming an  [expert beginner](
https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/): someone whose unwillingness to grow actively hinders or harms other people who depend on you, such as your family or your colleagues.

That situation you had with your math courses, where at the first sign of not-fun you gave up, will always recur in every situation worth pursuing because that's how it works. Joy is a transient ephemeral thing that exists only at a sweet spot of low effort - predicating your life based on that dopamine kick will hurt you.

That is not to say you shouldn't have fun or seek out things you enjoy  - but it does mean that, at some point, you have to recognize it is not enough to sustain your commitment to something.

- *Life is not fair or meritocratic: the thing you are good at might end up having no value*

Telegraph operators used to be some of the most highly sought-after people in the world. The best of them practiced obsessively, and could decipher Morse code at the speed of sound itself. 

Then the telephone was invented, and suddenly these golden boys, flying high on the spurs of their own success, were out of a job. Many retrained, throwing aside all of their hours spent cultivating fast operations. Some could not, and suffered for it. 

These situations are not rare. People who have lived through recessions (as we are now) or more catastrophic events such as fleeing a war-torn area talk often about how they've had to start their life anew, with no support and often no overlap with what that they've spent their lives doing. College professors in their home countries work as taxi drivers in their country of asylum. One in ten people in the US is unemployed now because of unforeseen events. And this is not even discussing sudden illnesses that affect you permanently e.g. loss of vision or something else.

Shit happens.

If you never take the time to learn skills you don't like or to engage with adversity, then, when life inevitably throws a hammer at you, you'll be in a double bind: unable to do what you're good at, and unable to do anything else. This is why even-ing out your weaknesses is valuable. This is whwn learning something you're not good at becomes useful. 

- *What other people need need not be what you offer.*

Thinking only about your own pleasure or joy is relatively selfish. I don't mean that in a bad way: it's good to put yourself and your comfort first. But I do mean that, in the grand scheme of things, your desires affect the bigger structures you are part of.

One day you might receive a promotion and have to actively manage people. You will be called upon to make decisions you might know nothing about, or solve problems well beyond your current skills or abilities. This is *normal* - it's life, in fact! Your choices at that time can affect other people's lives - and do you not agree that your responsibility then is to make the most informed, ethical and compassionate decisions you can make? 

To do that, you need to go beyond your own narrow domain of expertise. You need to engage with people, learn from them even if it's not easy, be able to appreciate what's happening and make meaningful contributions quickly. In a position of responsibility, you can't afford to feel bad because you suck - the trick is to accept you suck and keep going anyway because other people need you to rise to the occasion instead of scurrying away. 

All of the above should serve to demonstrate why focusing only on what you have a natural talent for is net harmful in the long run. You need to better all-around: to improve on what you're already good at, but also what you're not good at, out of necessity, responsibility and  insurance in case of things going bad.

---

The first reason is not problematic because it's false, but rather because you think it's a good justification. Difficult things are difficult by definition. In the short-term, of course, improvement will be slow and glacial. 

However, ease has no relationship to value. People have fun doing things they suck at because they aren't tangled up in what other people think about them, which is often where ""wanting to do easy things"" comes from.

I enjoy writing, for example, because I love stories and want to say I've made something I can be proud of - it's difficult because I'm also acutely aware of how far I have yet to go despite my years of effort at it, but it's a challenge I want to surmount because the rewards are worth it. I don't care how many other people love my writing or hate it - all that matters is living up to my own standards one day, and believing it can be done. This is *intrinsic motivation*, as opposed to *extrinsic motivation*.

There *is* a difference between doing things you really see no value in (which you rightly shouldn't feel you have to do), and doing things that will eventually have value (which is what you wrongly lump in with the previous category). Doing a difficult video game by itself is pointless unless you like challenges and savour the rush of solving puzzles - but doing it because you think it'll bring you closer to your boyfriend through shared experiences? Priceless. 

You have to find your own reasons for doing things in life. You need to have your own moral code, your own values, your own boundaries, and your own ambitions. Fortunately, you have a lot of time ahead of you - the rest of your life, in fact. It is too short a time to spend competing for the affections of an invisible crowd - seek to satisfy your goals, rather than your heart.

I wish to leave you with a couple of literature recommendations.

The first is Chris Hadwell's _An Astronaut's Guide to Living on Earth_. It is a beautiful exposition about Hadwell's own journey towards achieving his dream of being an astronaut, which is arguably the most difficult thing you can do. This book is remarkable because the life lessons he distills have nothing to do with being an astronaut: he discusses overcoming fear in the face of the unknown, about how to effectively grow to meet challenges, about how to keep yourself motivated during the long and difficult slogs, and many other things. I feel very strongly it will help you.

The second is a review paper on the existing literature of motivation: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://images.pearsonassessments.com/images/tmrs/Motivation_Review_final.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiq-ODezJrqAhUzhHIEHXLFBkAQFjABegQIChAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0-TZE1WGvmlD963HPz-tog&amp;cshid=1593012650358

"People don't hate racists, they hate racist white people","Firstly, racism is bad, acting and discriminating based on race and skin color should not be condoned. People often hate racist but I see sort of a double standard between who they like and who they don't. As an Asian (and someone who has experienced racism), I know the racism that exists in Asia but for example, people love Japan and Japanese people even though undoubtedly a lot of them are racist and xenophobic. If you travel there, you're literally supporting a nation of racists (over generalization I know). Yet if a white person were just to openly come out and say 'I'm a racist' no doubt they would get a lot more hate. This comes to my second point, I believe a majority of people are racist in some way shape or form but they are not necessarily 'bad' as long as they don't act on it. I know plenty of compassionate and kind people who unfortunately make racist comments every now and then. Sometimes I feel those who feel a certain way against a certain race or skin color just can't help it just as some people are afraid of spiders. The more we demonize, the more suppressed it becomes and I think it should sort've be treated like depression where creating a stigma around it doesn't really help the issue at hand.",hd2aok,"I can kind of see where you’re going with your second point.


I don’t agree with your first point as much. Yes, people do talk about white racism much more. But is that because they only here white racists? Or is it because the people around you are from white majority countries where white racists are more relevant. 
 
I think generally people do Han Chinese with Uighyurs, Hindu Indians with Muslims, or Japanese historical ignorance with Korea and China. 

These are more overt, generalized cases but do you expect someone from the US or UK to care enough to protest Japanese racists? No, not because they don’t think Japanese racism is ok, but more because racist Japanese people aren’t as big a thing in their surroundings.",fvkowf9,2.0
"Reason is, and ought only to be, the slave of the passions.","The title of this post is a famous quote from the Scottish philosopher David Hume.  

Hume's argument, which I think is correct, is that reason alone cannot be an effective guide to human action, because only through ""passions"" which are Hume's terms for emotions and desires, do we have motivation to act.

That is, in the Humean worldview, reason is an instrumental tool which is only useful when given a motivating direction by passions, which exist independent of reasoned thought.

It has been a while since I read Kant or any of the a priori reason arguments he made, and I am looking to see if I'm missing something from them, or perhaps an argument I have entirely not considered.",hoyzw7,"First off, I just want to say that this has been a wonderful thread and it seriously warms my heart to see such an awesome thread! Also, I am on mobile and apologize for any glaring grammar or spelling I might miss. 

I’d like to offer a challenge from Socrates. I’d also like to mention that my use of “Socrates” here isn’t to mean Plato using the character of Socrates as a mouth piece but what a fair amount of historians believe would have been Socrates’ actual view. It was believed that he held a view which stated that all of human error comes from incorrect or mistaken beliefs. All human beings search for what they believe to be good but what they truly believe is good isn’t always so. 

For instance, suppose you are on a diet because you believe doing so will help your health which will improve your life and that is ultimately good. However, several weeks in, you find yourself craving your favorite junk food and you just can’t resist the temptation so you consume the junk food knowing it’s bad for your diet. Socrates’ claim is that you had two competing beliefs at that moment: a) ‘being on a diet is good for me and will make me feel good’ and b) ‘eating my favorite junk food will make me feel good and therefore it is good’. For the sake of the argument, assume that a is the correct choice and you still went for b. 

A lot of people would call that being tempted or being weak willed, but Socrates attributes it to your reason; you believed that b was actually better than a and therefore you chose it. There is no such thing as weakness of will on this view. 

Now consider what passion is. Passion, for Hume and for a good deal of others, is a strong positive emotional attachment to something x that exists independent of the reasoning about x. That is, we don’t choose to love the things we do, we just love them and seek out activities about said things. 

The challenge that I believe Socrates to be raising to the claim “reason ought to be a slave to the passions” is that reasoning is part of passion. A painter loves to paint because they have a belief about the world where painting is the highest good. Completing that logical chain for them produces that feeling of passion. You could not be passionate without reason, on this view because you need to complete a series of logical steps to achieve your goal which produces strong, desirable feelings. That being said, Socrates might even go so far as to say there is no such thing as passion as an emotion Independent of reason. There are only beliefs and reasoning about those beliefs. You possibly could get around this by redefining what you mean by “passion” but you’d also have to produce some more information on why reason ought to be a slave to passion under a new definition, which would include reasoning as a base component. 

Elsewhere it is argued that passion and emotions in general are all grounded in reason. Consider fear as an emotion. It isn’t the case that anyone is just afraid. Even if you are in the midst of a hallucination, your fear is about something. A person might be afraid of the dark because of not knowing what’s in the dark. The unknown could be harmful and that person has a belief that they do not want to be harmed. Therefore the fear isn’t truly about the dark itself, it’s about the potential harm to one’s self. Fear is a string of logical conclusions about beliefs in which we are avoiding some sort of negative outcome. 

This works for passion too. We don’t just experience passion and passion alone. Passion is about something. Passion requires a series of logical steps about beliefs in order for its own existence. Passion, then, always comes after reasoning about beliefs has been concluded and could not be the master of reason because reason necessarily drives passion. 

I hope this makes sense. Thanks again for the great post!",fxmdtc6,5.0
It Should be Socially Acceptable for Individuals to Choose Whether They Want to Address Others by using their Sex Pronouns or their Gender Pronouns,"**CMV: It Should be Socially Acceptable for Individuals to Choose Whether They Want to Address Others by using their Sex Pronouns or Instead their Gender Pronouns**

# Definitions:

\-For the purpose of this post I’m going to simply say that a gender pronoun is one based on one’s gender identity whilst a sex pronoun is one based on a person’s biological sex. A gender pronoun can be one of many things, whilst a sex pronoun has to be the universally accepted notions of ‘he/his’ (male) or ‘she/her’ (female). Any intersex pronoun should be accepted for such.

I hear all the time that if somebody has a specific gender pronoun then you should use it. I disagree. I think that the individual should be able to choose if they want to use sex or gender pronouns for a specific person and **this is why:**

# 1. Ecological Biology Sex Pronouns

It’s no secret that we use pronouns based on sex all the time, and ecological biology is a good example of this. [Animals don’t have gender](https://www.sapiens.org/culture/gender-identity-nonhuman-animals/) (except in certain scenarios), so when we use pronouns for them we must be referring to sex. As an example: “Close-Up Video of Colorado Mountain Lion and [Her](https://kgab.com/close-up-video-of-colorado-mountain-lion-and-her-3-cubs/) 3 Cubs” or “In every single instance, the cuckoo accomplished her mission and laid [her](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/cuckoos-arent-secretly-jerks-theyre-just-jerks-180951916/) eggs.” or “Instead the female lays one egg each day until [she](https://extension.psu.edu/the-secret-life-of-bluebirds) has a full clutch”.

So here it’s very clear that it’s completely valid to refer to animals with pronouns based on their biological sex. Humans are animals, and we have biological sexes. I know that humans are more complex and have genders, but I don’t see why gender pronouns should override sex pronouns. Since they’re both used regularly, and this is a very clear-cut example of sex pronouns being used in a professional setting, I see no reason why we can’t use either when talking to humans

# 2. Legal and Professional Complications

From everything I know, gender identity is a social construct and has incredible fluidity. The law doesn’t do social constructs very well, and instead deals with innate, unchangeable characteristics, like your sex. Your drivers’ license or passport has your sex on it, as does your medical records. If you’re talking to border security or the police, their understanding of how to address you will come from these documents. I don’t see why it would be wrong to do sex pronouns in these legal settings like this, as it formalizes the process.

Another good example of this would be a teacher with the sex of a student on the registry. I know people like Jordan Peterson [get quite pissed](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37875695) over the gender pronouns, and although I don’t agree with most of what he believes, I feel like a lot of his concerns could be resolved by normalizing the use of sex pronouns for those like him. Other professors could use gender pronouns, but if Peterson prefers sex pronouns, I see no reason why this would be a problem. It allows people with alternating views on gender identity to completely dodge the problem, and let’s people express their own views in their language and not have to confront peoples’ personal identities everytime you want to address them with a pronoun.

# 3. Formality vs Colloquialism

In French when we don’t know someone very well we default on using the “vouvoiement”. This is a more formal way of addressing someone and prevents you from addressing the power dynamic between yourselves. When you become more familiar with someone (like a friend) you use the “tutoiement” which is more colloquial. But no matter the case, both are accepted, and you can almost never go wrong with using the “vouvoiement”.

I feel like we should follow a similar (but not exactly similar) trend with sex vs gender pronouns. If you know somebody’s biological sex (perhaps from a legal document or registry), there’s never a way to go wrong with using sex pronouns. Let’s say you are a teacher addressing a large class, with registries of sex for each student. If you want to pronoun a student, you should be able to default on their sex from the registry instead of having to learn about their gender identity. Contrastingly, if you are close with someone, and you know about their gender identity, you may choose to use their gender pronoun, kinda like how you would choose to use the “tutoiement” with a friend. If you want to guess someone’s gender identity, and don’t have an identifying document of sex you could default on their gender identity or the sex you perceive them to have.

In [this very entertaining video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiijS_9hPkM) Peterson clashes with another professor (Prof. Peet), where Peterson asks Peet how he is supposed to realistically remember bizarre gender pronouns. Peet says that Peterson should write down pronouns on his phone as a solution. I personally think this is a very weak solution, and that allowing people to speak fluidly between sex and gender pronouns would be a much better solution as this allows people to go off of legal documents and instincts instead of learning individual gender identities and having to involve themselves in gender issues.

# 4. Individual Control Over Language

I fundamentally believe that one of the worst possible ways to advance LGBT acceptance in society is to force language on other people. It makes the movement seem more aggressive and intrusive and presses gender identities into peoples’ lives. If somebody doesn’t want to engage in other peoples’ views on gender, we shouldn’t make them amend their language to suit such. We should let these people express their views in language through the universal characteristic of sex instead of making them engage in a conversation on gender identity.

# Additional Notes:

\-Gender on Registries: I disagree with adding an option for gender on registries, as it forces a social construction into a place where it isn’t needed. People shouldn’t be expected to have to announce their genders, and the norm shouldn’t be to do such in a legal fashion. I feel like using sex instead, and adding gender colloquially in conversation as familiarity advances would be a much better solution and reduces big government intrusiveness in personal identities.

\-Intersex: People should be able to address intersex people by their sex pronouns (whatever they are). There’s no universally accepted notion on what intersex pronouns are “correct”, but people should learn options that are acceptable sex pronouns for intersex people (like they/them) without having to use pronouns for gender identity.",mggbbh,Why should something rude be socially acceptable?,gsuj9lu,4.0

Toilets with a wide pool of water in the bowl are superior to toilets with a small pool at the bottom.,"This insight came to me, as you have probably guessed, while taking a rather large poo. Well in fact just after flushing this formidable excretion. I am on holiday in Florida, while normally I live in the U.K. In the house I’m staying at, the water in the toilet bowl is a large pool - I’d say roughly 10 inches lengthwise and at least 8 side to side. In comparison, the pool of water in my commode back home is a paltry 5 x 5 inches. Now, while I don’t necessarily believe the old U.S catechism that ‘bigger is better’, in this case I think it’s true. The larger body of toilet water has the following benefits:

1) Better flushing capability: the larger amount of water gives more power, very convenient when trying to expel a mighty turd such as the one I laid down this morning.

2) More space in the water: very useful when the formidable log you have laid is positioned lengthwise to the U-bend, the extra space allows it to manoeuvre into a more streamlined position, much like a cargo ship coming in to a narrow dock.

3) Less chance of skid marks in the bowl: this one is what really impressed me. After the brown beast I brought into this world plopped menacingly into the water below, I thought for sure I’d be faced with the unenviable task of scrubbing fecal residue off the porcelain with a fetid brush, possibly getting some splash back in the process and ruining my morning. But I needn’t have worried - the large expanse of water was sufficient to hold the turd torpedo securely above the toilet bowl, keeping it clean until it’s powerful flush sent the unwanted passenger off into unknown waters.

Now I’m sure there are some downsides, but on the whole I believe this type of latrine is superior to its shallow and unforgiving neighbour. But I’m open to debate, so please - CMV.

Atheists are just as logically invalid as those who believe in a God are.,"I have identified as atheist for the last 6 years. Last year, I took a epistemology philosophy class which was one of the first classes in college that changed my established views- specifically on consciousness and religion.

What I came to realize, was that since there is no real evidence for atheism, there is no reason to subscribe to that belief. Atheists claim that religion is bogus because there is no proof, which is hypocritical. There is no real way to prove anything related to god (whether is be for or against) *at the moment*. Claims by religious followers that they saw Jesus or Heavens gates when they died is just that- anecdotal evidence that has no real weight in a logical argument.

Medically assisted death (AD) should be available to those with depression.,"Change My View: Medically assisted death (AD) should be available to those with depression. 

Here are the requirements for AD in Canada and I'm assuming they're somewhat similar (or even more lenient) in equally progressive countries.

https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/medical-assistance-dying.html#grievous


AD requires that the person be suffering from a grevious and irremediable medical condition and it must be following all the criteria as such:

Have a serious illness, disease, or disability.

How are we suppose to quantify what counts as serious? If it results in death? If so, then we should be barring paraplegic people from AD? However, if all life ends in death, then doesn't that nullify the seriousness of other diseases that end in death? Pain is also the same as seriousness. How are we suppose to say that Person A is in more pain than Person B when both have different pain tolerances? Should it not be up to the person themselves rather than a poorly constructed bill that won't ever consider the edge cases? Is depression considered serious? I would say to a varying degree, yes. It is a disease of the mind that literally rots the brain and allows for other diseases to prevail. It is difficult to detect and even more difficult to cure as many of the remedies are costly and difficult to aquire. To bar those who suffer from depression the right to death with dignity is only going to prolong their suffering. Many countries have legalized marijuana and have even set up safe places for people to take the drug due to the realization that facilitating a safe place for these actions is better than trying to making them illegal. Why can't we do the same for depression?


Be in an advanced state of decline that cannot be reversed.

Depression is a state of decline. If it weren't, everyone would want to be depressed. To say you can reverse it is just as true as saying you can't reverse it. Some treatments only work if the person is willing to allow them to work. If they aren't willing, then those treatments are ineffective and the possibility that those treatments can reverse depression are effectively 0. A cocktail of drugs can mask the problems of depression but that isn't curing someone, that's blocking their symptoms. It's like the drugs used for slowing the effects of ALS. Just because they're available doesn't bar those who suffer from ALS the right to AD. 


Experience unbearable physical or mental suffering from your illness, disease, disability or state of decline that cannot be relieved under conditions that you consider acceptable.

If someone is willing to commit suicide either way, then I would consider their situation to be unbearable to them. This is their perspective, not mine, and if they cannot live in the way they deem bearable, who are we to say it is bearable? What is the difference between having chronic physical pain and wishing you were dead and having chronic mental pain and wishing you were dead? Why is one apparently far worse than the other that it would be deemed eligible for AD while the other is not? 


Be at a point where your natural death has become reasonably foreseeable.

If someone is going to commit suicide either way, their death is eminent. Why is suicide not considered a natural death? It is an eventual outcome of the disease of depression. Just like losing all motor function is an outcome of ALS. Just because some commit suidice and other don't does not make it any less natural than dying from the symptoms of other diseases. If a mesothelioma victim didn't exhibit all symptoms of mesothelioma, are they suddenly ineligible for AD? Does that somehow diminish the natural death caused by mesothelioma? No. 


When are we going to accept that some mental diseases just cannot be cured? Depression fits the bill for AD and yet those who suffer from it are barred from such an option. If countries can allow people to die because they are ""tired of life"", why does that suddenly exclude depression? Depression should not be treated like some taboo subject that's different from all other diseases. It's not and those that suffer from it should have the right to all options of remedy, including death with dignity.",is602s,"So, I have depression, and even attempted suicide in the past, I failed, and am pretty happy I did. I actually kinda feel like the failing part, is what helped me improve. 

If this option were available, I probably would have taken it, and I would have made a mistake. Since the death would be in the hands of someone capable, and not someone who downed almost an entire bottle of jack, there would be no messing up. 

The idea of assisted death, I support. Someone should have the ability to make that choice. People try to talk about ""what about their family"" or ""all life is precious"" and thats true, but if the person has come to terms, and has made this very difficult decision to end their life, that should be respected.

However, and this is the difference, that is usually when the person is already nearing deaths door (i.e. cancer, life support, something like that), while depression, isnt a terminal illness. Depression can be worked with, in a much better sense than someone with stage 4 cancer. 

Depression is all about your mental health. And when you go low and into a dark place, and trust me... thag happens... you make some of the most ridiculous arguments, or justifications. Ones that, when you're out of that spiral, and can breath, you can realize that those thoughts, aren't true. That its the depression, and you can work through it. 

Making choices, while depressed, already seem like a herculean task, and you usually pick some really shitty options like calling your ex, or hurting yourself, or deciding that the amazing Spiderman movies are worth watching, if you already make those bad decisions while depressed... and then give that person the option to kill themselves, but have someone else do it for them (which gets rid of the whole self-preservation thing your brain does), a lot of regrettable, and irreversible decisions WILL happen. 

Just my two cents though",g5g5q2v,3.5
I support changing our senators pay and benefits.,"I have done some research into the a senators job discription and here are some things I've learned that anyone can find:

*Senators are paid $175,00/year AFTER benefits including:
     - full coverage for Healthcare (totally reasonable, but
       why can't everybody have that?)
     - pension FOR LIFE after 5 years of service
     - allowances AFTER their yearly income
*Senators are contractually obligated to work ONLY 128 days/year

If there are 535 senators all earning $175,000 annually that's roughly $90 million/year. Now, to put that in perspective, assuming they were to only work on that schedule doing 8hr days like most Americans they would be making roughly $117/hr. earning a years worth of pay in 1/3 of the time compared to the average American.

So, while 13 million people work year-round for $20,000 earning below $13/hr with no vacation time barely able to afford the basic necessities like food, water, clothing, shelter, and others that are pretty much just as needed to survive in modern society like vehicles, car insurance, health insurance, internet, school, etc.

We could be paying them $50,000/year, which is more than enough even for a family of 5 while saving taxpayers $60 million to put somewhere more important like subsidies to scientific or medical research institutions, pay people in an effort to aid cities like Flint, Michigan who are STILL without clean water, or even to incentivise companies to go green. Obviously it will not happen all at once, but I feel we could be using this money elsewhere, and if we're wasting that much, how much else are not benefitting society?

Is that not socialism for the rich, paid for by the poor?

Smoking cigarettes around non-consenting adults and children is assault.,"Why do we consider pushing someone, hitting someone, or grabbing someone and injecting them with heroin without consent to be assault, but we don’t consider smoking cigarettes around those not consenting to be assault? What’s the difference?

It has been long established that secondhand smoke can cause cancer (see [this meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6164459/). Not in anecdotes, but in science. Yet in American culture, or at least I should say in the state of Indiana where I live, nobody bats an eye when someone lights a cigarette and smokes, even a few feet away from you, when they know that you, a complete stranger, are going to be breathing it in. Unfortunately, as someone who does not want to get lung cancer from others’ addictions, the only thing to do is walk away and leave the area once the smell becomes evident, after usually already breathing in some unwillingly. Many events and areas, like concerts or public parks, are often filled with people that will light up regardless of how many people will be affected. So, my question again, how is this not assault? What is the difference between this and other forms of behavior that are deemed to be “assault”?",c806qt,"Some places allows smoking in public. By walking in public, you consent to possibly being exposed to cigarette smoke. Some places ban smoking in public areas, especially hospitals, schools, etc. If you are exposed to smoke there, it could be considered assault.

Also, intentionality matters. If you push someone, hit someone, or grab someone and inject them with a needle, you are purposefully making physical contact with them. If you smoke near someone, you are making contact with the air, and they are independently making contact with the air as well. They would have to purposefully blow smoke in your face to have direct person to person contact. It's perfectly legal to swing your arms around. It's not legal to punch someone in the face.

Contamination with animal products is not in any way detrimental to your own view of veganism - for health, or for ecological and ethical reasons.

American Privilege Completely Overshadows White Privilege,"Point: People in the US are so focused on White vs POC conditions such that they forgot that their own country is pillaging and murdering millions. Black systematic oppression in the US is existent and it is tragic. But Americans of all color are too blinded by their American privilege to say anything about the atrocities in the Middle East.

Much needed elaboration:

I)

&gt;People in the US are so focused on White vs POC conditions such that they forgot that their own country is pillaging and murdering millions

How is the US destroying the lives of millions? Currently in Lebanon and Syria, from my own experience (and credible sources of course), the economic sanctions are giving the people hell. People are committing suicide due to not being able to afford basic provisions. Some are setting themselves on fire. While the Syrian Civil War is coming to an end, [the US is now doubling down on its economic war against the country](https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news/2020/06/09/Syria-economic-crisis-currency-exchange-rate-crash-us-sanctions). US sanctions have been described as ""economic terrorism"" against the country. This has serious effects on the neighbouring countries, especially Lebanon.

In fact, deteriorating economic conditions in the Middle East give rise to brutal dictators. It's a chain of terrible consequences due to America's unjust actions and intervention.

II) What is American privilege? American privilege is when death and suffering in the Middle East is regarded as merely a statistic. It is when lives away from the US are regarded as less valuable than American lives. This ties neatly with the next point.

III) Why should Americans care as strongly for people that are not their own? I totally understand being apathetic to things that are so far away. Human empathy can only handle so much before it burns out. But in this situation, it is the American government that is causing these tragedies. And since America is a democratic country where the governmental institutions represent the people, then the people are held liable.

This is why Americans should care. And Americans don't. There is a sentiment of sympathizing with the Middle East but it is no more than that. Empty sympathy. Like spilling your drink and saying ""oops."" Whereas in this situation, the drink is being spilled every single second, in gallons.

IV) How does this tie to White privilege and does it negate it? No, white privilege within the US exists and that is undeniable. However, having the narrative just focused on white privilege makes, it seem like it is the ultimate evil. Like there is no stronger privilege than it. And this narrative is dismissive to a destructive extent.

Ignoring the much stronger privilege of being American is devastating. We are suffering due to those who have been elected by the American people. Our governments are becoming more authoritarian, and sanctions keep getting stronger. It's a terrible cycle that I do not wish on anyone. 

Then the cycle only breaks when America invades us and flattens our cities, which is more or less worse. Having electricity in your homes, having oil in your country while tapping into other country's resources is an unjust privilege. 

Finally:

All human lives are equal. Middle Eastern lives matter as much as American lives. But unfortunately the media has brainwashed even us Arabs to believe that this isn't the case. That we are less valuable. It is a privilege to be able to consider your life of value.

Please change my view.

The food place that closely matches LC's deals is Pizza Hut and it's Boxed Combo for $13. For $13 you can get a 8 piece deep dish pizza, bread sticks and a cinnamon dessert. Now for LC you could get a $6 anoxemic pizza, $4 crazy bread and their famous cinnamon sticks (oh wait they removed it 6 years ago), so let's add another crazy bread which makes it $14. The taste may be different to everyone however if i'm being honest the quality of LC is very inconsistent compared to other fast food places.

Manual labor is more fulfilling than an office job,"When it’s nice outside I often get to enjoy it, when it’s super shitty out I stay home.   My place of work is always changing.  The objectives and tasks make sense almost 100% of the time.  Instead of busy work there is grunt work which really isn’t so bad, if you haven’t dug a hole in well your whole life, give it a shot.

Working at a desk increases your risk of heart attack by 50% 

I don’t have to talk to anybody I don’t want to 99% of the time.  

My job is a workout,  I wasn’t a fat kid but I did have a little soda &amp; video game gut when I was young,  but now my life is so active I can’t even gain weight when I try to.  I would have to go to the gym 20hrs a week to get the metabolism I have now if I worked at a desk.

When you complete something wether it’s cleaning an apartment or building a brick wall, you see the results of your efforts and it is rewarding to see your accomplishment.  There are lots of ways to get fulfillment out of working but seeing the tangible results and the excitement and approval of a customer is it’s own reward.

I’ve never received a memo,  I don’t have to ‘kill time’, and I’ve never been forced to sit in some meeting that could be considered a form of torture.  Actually not true, I did get a job with a insurance restoration company which didn’t last long because they liked having ‘safety meetings’ where they talked to us like we were 12 and made us answer extremely simple questions in order to get through it, which they got a kick back for doing, not because they cared about us working safe.  This is my one experience with office culture which I quickly escaped from. 

At the end of the movie office space, the happy ending is the main character getting a construction job.

If you can acquire any basic skill, painting, cleaning, landscaping, or something else. You can go into business for yourself and if you do decent work every job completed usually leads to more work from that costumer or their friends.   You may have to subcontract first which isn’t the best money, but once you gain the confidence to be your own boss or find a good crew to work with that actually rewards good work you can make well over 25hr.  Jobs pay differently depending on many things but I’ve made 100hr on various gigs many times and it’s because I’ve done the legwork to be worth it.

I’m constantly learning things and being challenged by aspects of my work.  While at the same time I am often free to engage my mind in a podcast or music while I get things done.

I only work 9 months out of the year.

I could really go on but I guess i should say I’ve never had an office job, but I have friends who do and it sounds like a draining version of adult daycare half the time followed by a host of middle management whose job is basically to be annoying.  Or you are middle management in which case your job is both to be annoying and to be scolded for not being annoying enough.

The only exception I would expect is in small businesses that might have a different dynamic if there is good leadership and communication.   I’m primarily addressing the issues of a larger 50+ person offices and the corporate office politics which seem to have the ability to slowly drain the life out of someone.



The short of it: change my view by painting a picture of how an office job is enjoyable and explain to me how my perceptions are merely stereotypes which get played up.  My general view is that doing remedial tasks that engage your body are more rewarding than remedial tasks which do not engage your mind in any compelling way but rather try your patience and drain your energy.",mdntqq,"Geological engineer here.

And when you start to get older and weaker you become less useful, your peak output will be in your mid 20s an then it will trail off. And what happens if a job becomes mechanized?

Cultural squeamishness about bare feet in public is irrational and arguably responsible for the majority of foot problems,"I grew up in a country (South Africa) where bare feet are much more acceptable in public. Children are widely allowed, even encouraged, to attend primary school barefoot. The same situation applies in New Zealand and possibly a few other countries. Yet the vast majority of cultural norms elsewhere in the world dictate that feet should be hidden away, locked up in shoes ('little coffins for the feet' as someone once described them) - a sweaty, bacteria-rich, damp and cramped environment that creates unpleasant smell and often long-term problems of painful and unsightly deformities. That's led to a sort of vicious circle, where people are ashamed of their feet because they smell and/or look ugly, but they smell/look ugly because.. they're cramped up in shoes because.. they're ashamed of being smelt/visible in public, and everybody will judge you etc. etc.

There are of course many situations in which you \*would\* want shoes.. if it's cold, for example, or if your feet genuinely need protecting from sharp or falling objects, such as on a building site or on a rocky trail. But shoes in those situations are like protective gloves. And we don't wear gloves at all times in public do we?

One might counter this by saying that surfaces you walk on are worse than those you touch with your hands, but this is largely untrue. There are far worse things on door handles than there are on a clean sidewalk or in a mall, or in an office. And when you walk barefoot, you look where you walk, and avoid stuff if you need to. It isn't difficult, and the risks are far outweighed by the benefits.

My view is that we're long overdue for a rational change of our cultural biases on this subject (those biases originating at various points in history e.g. associations of poverty, or 'those damned hippie liberals' etc.) and just come to terms with the fact that we'd be far healthier and happier without shoes most of the time.

Update edit:

Brilliant to read everyone's responses, it's fascinating and thanks for engaging (sorry I've not replied to all..) 

No deltas awarded yet though because as far as I can see, loads of folk are just posting here about their (mostly unfounded) fears about what they might tread on, which doesn't acknowledge the point I made in my OP: in any \*real\* risky situations (of which there are plenty) then yes shoes are needed - but much of what people think is dangerous or risky really is imaginary. Or at least very much overhyped/catastrophised - including in city environments, by the way. South African schools know this. They wouldn't allow kids to school barefoot if they thought it was a significant risk.

But it seems to me what we \*don't\* have is a universal cultural environment in which each person can judge the dangers/inconveniences and make their own decisions on being barefoot in public or not without being on the receiving end of disapproving stares, tutting, 'no shoes no service' signs and the like. In other words, it's gone beyond a rational, personal, practical decision and become a \*cultural taboo \*- even at the expense of foot health problems. But a taboo only in certain countries. That's what's interesting to unpack.",eo3b53,"Outside isn't made with barefoot in mind.

That sort of impracticality will of course be associated with a degree of confusion when 98% of the time it makes no sense. I see nothing irrational about the stigma. 

&gt;sweaty, bacteria-rich, damp and cramped environment that creates unpleasant smell and often long-term problems of painful and unsightly deformities
In calling them bacteria rich and crammed environments and that they create deformities, you're kind of doing the same thing you're criticizing when you disagree with people who think there's great risk associated with the outdoors. While in certain situations it may happen, its overall an unrealistic claim. The average person does not have issues because of shoes. They wash their feet, get the right size shoe, change their socks daily, replace shoes often and take them off at the end of the day. The average, casual relationship with shoes is completely healthy and poses no legitimate threat or concern. 

&gt;There are far worse things on door handles than there are on a clean sidewalk or in a mall, or in an office.
Office and mall maybe because they are constantly cleaned, but you may be forgetting that sidewalks are exposed to animal use too. Rats, birds, dogs, cats, insects, all which regularly do their business on, bring their food onto and run around sidewalks, streets, etc. No one power washes and soaps sidewalks, they have equally if not significantly more chances of have trace amounts of bacteria/dangerous substances from food, pee, fecal matter vomit, animals, vehicles, etc..

Also, in this overall scenario, you're suggesting a world where on any given day, some people are wearing shoes and some aren't. I'd argue that people not wearing shoes are then at a disadvantage for a number of reasons against people who are wearing shoes. Feet getting stepped on busy streets, needing to move quickly in the event of a fire/fire drill or other kind of evacuation (argument there is that the average indoor floor is much more uncomfortable to move quickly on without shoes), the height people get from shoes (which is dumb, but height plays a large role when it comes to social dynamics at work, dating, etc.. whether we like it or not), or even stuff like having to hold a metal door open if your hands are full. You don't always think about when your shoes are protecting you, similar to you don't realize how often you use your pinky finger until it's injured. I wear steel toed boots at work and have often hurt my toes in regular shoes doing things I can usually do in steel toes. Now I get that steel toes offer a high degree of protection from force compared to regular shoes, but regular shoes offer a high degree of protection from force compared to being barefoot, and for most people, not registering having that protection can lead to injury.",febbyl7,4.0
"The Senate should be abolished, and the House should move to some sort of Proportional Representation","In my view the senate is a fairly anti-democratic institution, and should be wholly replaced by [some sort of proportional representation system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRR2sK1k1Zo), in my view party list proportional would be the best since you still get to vote for specific members of congress. Now here's why the senate is anti-democratic:

1) It gives smaller states much more voting power in the more important of the two houses of congress. In this regard, it's similar to why the electoral college should be abolished. A vote from Wyoming is massively inflated compared to one in Texas or Florida.

2) Defendants of the system will argue it guarantees smaller states against the bigger ones, but this isn't really an argument that needs to be made in the 21st century. There are very few issues that we vote on in national elections that are small states vs. big states.

3) There's very little to do with geography in politics either. The biggest issues in the 19th and 20th centuries having to do with this were racist laws about slavery and post slavery. At this point virtually all American states in national elections focus on the exact same issues. The only major difference I can see is coal mining in the Appalachians, but as we outgrow an economy fixated on geographic resources, the need for senate even in this view greatly diminishes. 

----------------------------------------------------------

At this point we should just expand the number of members in the House of Representatives, and move towards a proportional voting system because:

1) It would be impossible to gerrymander.

2) It would remove the third party spoiler effect in voting.

3) It's the most guaranteed voting system to make sure that all voices are properly heard.",cbyf5c,"&gt;2) Defendants of the system will argue it guarantees smaller states against the bigger ones, but this isn't really an argument that needs to be made in the 21st century. There are very few issues that we vote on in national elections that are small states vs. big states.

This really isn't true at all. The reality is that smaller states have a much smaller amount of important infrastructure, and their economic value is reflected by that. The most hotly debated topic of last election was a small vs big state issue, being coal. 

For example, California has very strong tech infrastructure. I live in   a town of 25k people in California and I have access to the best internet on the market. But this is because the state is super massive.

Then you move midwest to a place like Nebraska, and their best internet packages are comparatively awful for the exact same price. This is because the middle of the country is a technological dead zone.

This leads to a divide between the two, because the coastal states like California and New York are super progressive, green and have the tech infrastructure to support that lifestyle. But the middle states are stuck in an era of manufacturing, low skilled labor and anti-intellectualism, and the larger states don't clearly represent those interests very well. So much so they are on the opposite side of the spectrum literally.

Now, I don't think its really worth protecting these types of industries. I'm all for automating them out and accepting our fate as pets for the machine overlords to come. BUT there is a very clear differing interest between the states, and smaller states do deserve their representation. If you want to solve this problem, you have to improve the infrastructure quality to be on par with everyone else so that newer ideas take hold, and if you move away from that representation before that point, it is purely elitist.",etj55pp,5.0
Ron is extremely unlikable (romantically) and he should not end up Hermione,"Ron abandoned Harry during in the fourth book because he was jealous that Harry was in the tournament.  He knew it was dangerous and Harry was potentially  facing death in the tournament. Gave him zero prep for the dragons in the first task. He didn't even speak to Harry until AFTER the first task.

Ron abandoned both Harry and Hermione in their greatest moment of need in the seventh book. This left Harry and Hermione in a very difficult and stressful situation. They were on the run trying to kill the most powerful wizard alive and Dumbledore was not around to help anymore. They were completely exposed. This was after Ron gave Harry his promise that he would see it through with and stay until the end. It was only luck that everything eventually worked out. Yes, he regretted his decision and tried to help after leaving BUT this was a life and death situation and a simple sorry doesn't suffice. It definitely shows that he's not reliable in high pressure situations  which is probably not something you want as your husband and the father of your children....

Ron is an extremely jealous person and not loyal at all. His most  redeeming  feature is that he gives Harry and Hermione access to a wizarding  family since they were raised by muggles.

He was below average student and magic user. He was unremarkable at  quidditch as he  only had one good game and the only reason he made the  team at all was  because his friends cheated for him. Cormac was better at the tryouts and should of been on the team. It's no coincidence that Ron played infamously bad in his first games.

Ron deep has a desire for attention and exploits attention whenever he receives it such as seeing Sirius Black in the dorm in the third book or becoming keeper in the fifth book. Harry was a quidditch star but never acted the way that Ron did.

Ron's feelings of inadequacy will not simple disappear while Hermione and Ron are in a relationship. In fact, they will only increase as Hermione  will have a much more successful career than him.

Ron is someone that was constantly jealous but never acknowledged the work the other people put into to be successful.

Hermione studied very hard, it was not an automatic thing.

Harry was famous for an incident in which both of his parents died and he  was  forced to live with muggles. Ron seems incapable of realizing how  hard  this is for Harry despite rescuing him in the second book. Before   abandoning Harry and Hermione he mentions that Harry can't know what   it's like to be worried about his family because Harry's family is dead.   A real slap in the face to Harry who is close to the Weasleys.

Fred and George experimented on themselves to start their shop.

What has Ron ever worked hard at?

Ron may have assisted Harry throughout the series but his below average knowledge and use of magic meant that many other people could have taken his spot and done just as well if not better. After the DA training, some of those members could have taken his spot going forward.

In   the Yule Ball, Hermione goes with Victor Krum who is basically   everything that Ron wants be. It's clear that Hermione will have her   choice of whoever she wants. If Hermione can reasonably pick whoever she wants why would she pick Ron?

It's unsurprising that Ron has a horrible time because surprise, he's insecure about the ugly robes he wore. He doesn't care at all about his date and the entire event is a disaster for him.

Throughout the books, Ron's toxic mentality, negativity, lack of work ethic and closed mindset bring Harry and Hermione down.

Now   that does not mean that Harry and Hermione can not be friends with Ron   but it's hard to imagine that Hermione could possibly be with Ron.

Ron exhibits many negative traits: jealousy, envy, laziness, attention-seeking, manipulation, misogyny and lust.

If Ron is such a great guy look what happened to Padma and Lavender. His record isn't the best.

He just used Lavender to satisfy his feelings of inadequacy and then discarded her later.

Padma  had a horrible time with him and he didn't seem to care at all. You  would think someone that supposedly so funny and so fun to be around  could get over wearing goofy looking clothes. He couldn't because he  really isn't someone that's fun to be around. I really doubt Fred or George would have acted the same way in that situation.

I  couldn't find any positive romantic moments between the two while they  were at school at all. Anytime there was a dance, ball, event or party  they never ended up together.

Hermione  took Krum to Yule Ball and Ron asked her at the last second and got  angry at her. Maybe he thought he owned her or something. Weird.

He also exposed this weird ownership dynamic again when he intruded into his younger sister's(only one year younger) relationship and criticized her for kissing her boyfriend. She rightly called him out for being a hypocrite.

No physical or emotional intimacy with Hermione while at school. Zero. None.

""**Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn't mean we all have**,"" said Hermione nastily, picking up her her quill again.

Sounds like true love right there.

The more you read, the more you notice it.

***When they describe the origins of their relationship to others what will they say?***

He  asked me out at the Yule Ball, the biggest international meeting of  wizarding students of the decade and we had a wonderful night together.

Nope.

After a quidditch victory I was so impressed that we embraced and passionately kissed.

Nope.

They  enjoyed spending time together alone at Hogwarts relaxing by the lake,  cuddling, stealing kisses and enjoying their precious time together.

Nope.....

He impressed me with his intelligence and work ethic.

Nope...

We both shared a passion for championing the rights of house elves and others that are oppressed.

Nope.

He was the perfect gentleman that treated women with respect.

Nope.

We had a great time studying together. (Hermione got tired of Ron and Harry taking advantage of her)

Nope.

Instant chemistry right from the start.

Nope.

Ron was just so loyal and I could always count on him when I needed him. He never abandoned me.

Nope.

Not many memories to cherish there.

It's hard for me to understand what other people are reading in the books that makes them out to be a great couple.

# ",gjf0cc,"I do not disagree with your conclusion that Hermione and Ron may not work,  but honestly? I think Hermione is the less likeable character.

That girl has no scruples!  

She inprisions and black-mails a woman mostly because said woman is a pain, not because she is a true enemy. 

She puts a curse on a sign up cheat and gives nobody a warning (it would have been A. more effective if people knew that telling on the DA had bad consequences, and B. Simply fairer.) 

She sends dangerous creepy birds after Ron that could have picked out his eyes. And dont tell me she was right because she was emotionally hurt. Worst Ron did was walking away from his friends (and lets be honest here: book 7?  Ron stormed off, but he tried to come back within the same day. The others had just left already. That's not abandoning anybody, but a blow up, a walk to clear his head...and people are gone), Hermione intentionally tried to hurt one of them because she was jealous. 

Hermione used mind magic on her own parents and made them forget who they are and that thry have a daughter. I honestly dont think anybody would agree with that, so, pretty horrible move there. I don't care if it was to protect them,  it still is screwed up. (And MORE screwed up the normal oblvation that makes muggles forget they saw something weird, dimply because it was such a big memory modification enompassing their whole lives.)


All of that is not even going into little things like showing NO empathy when a fellow classmate is sad her bunny died (because it is more important to point out how horrible diviniation is. You can be right and a jerk, Hermione).

It is valid to call the protest at the Capitol a white supremacist protest.,"
Had this argument with my friend and am curious what you all think. I think it’s fair to call them white supremacists, because of a few reasons. If you participate in a mob that’s mostly white and is littered with confederate flags, you have to deal with the consequences of being considered a white supremacist. 


My friend argues that you can’t call all of those people white supremacists because they are MAGA, and that calling them such a thing only worsens the divide between left and right.


To me, I feel that there is a difference between begrudgingly voting for someone because their policies align with your views better, vs. worshipping someone. I don’t own any Biden hat or sign because I don’t think he is the best leader, I just thought he was the better option.

A One-Male-Child Policy Is A Good Way To Deal With The Involuntary Celibacy Problem,"This specifically applies to the U.S., due to the incel problem that is affecting our country, but it could very easily work for any other country with an incel problem as well.

History shows what happens when men aren't getting the relationships they need to have good mental health. Revolutions and other history changing things happen because of it. Rome was created because there were too many men in the village and not enough women. I have a modern solution for our modern problem.

The implementation of a one-male-child program for the U.S. would be a very easy way to solve the inevitable problems that arise with a population of males that can't get a woman. It would also lower the crime rate, and with automation rearing it's ugly head, there will be less need for men in general.

Every woman would be required to have their fetus checked in utero at the time when primary sexual characteristics begin to form on the fetus. If they already have one male child, they will be attempted to be persuaded by the OBGYN to have the fetus aborted. If they choose otherwise, they will be required to have the child put into the foster care system. The child will then be conscripted into the military when they turn eighteen.

Immigration can solve any shortages of men that might arise in the U.S. from this policy.

"In heterosexual relationships the problem isn't usually women being nags, it's men not performing emotional labor.","It's a common conception that when you marry a woman she nags and nitpicks you and expects you to change. But I don't think that's true.

I think in the vast majority of situations (There are DEFINITELY exceptions) women are asking their partners to put in the planning work for shared responsibilities and men are characterising this as 'being a nag'.

I've seen this in younger relationships where women will ask their partners to open up to them but their partners won't be willing to put the emotional work in, instead preferring to ignore that stuff. One example is with presents, with a lot of my friends I've seen women put in a lot of time, effort, energy and money into finding presents for their partners. Whereas I've often seen men who seem to ponder what on earth their girlfriend could want without ever attempting to find out.

I think this can often extend to older relationships where things like chores, child care or cooking require women to guide men through it instead of doing it without being asked. In my opinion this SHOULDN'T be required in a long-term relationship between two adults.

Furthermore, I know a lot of people will just say 'these guys are jerks'. Now I'm a lesbian so I don't have first hand experience. But from what I've seen from friends, colleagues, families and the media this is at least the case in a lot of people's relationships.

Edit:  Hi everyone! This thread has honestly been an enlightening experience for me and I'm incredibly grateful for everyone who commented in this AND the AskMen thread before it got locked. I have taken away so much but the main sentiment is that someone else always being allowed to be the emotional partner in the relationship and resenting or being unkind or unsupportive about your own emotions is in fact emotional labor (or something? The concept of emotional labor has been disputed really well but I'm just using it as shorthand). Also that men don't have articles or thinkpieces to talk about this stuff because they're overwhelmingly taught to not express it.

There is nothing inherently wrong with Polygamy and it should not be illegal,"Like the title says, I believe that there is nothing inherently wrong with polygamy. If it is done by willing and consenting adults, who know what they are getting themselves into, then why should it be deemed illegal?

A sub point of this argument is that I don’t believe the government should be involved with marriage to begin with and that it is an overstep of their authority. 

If I have the ability to financial take care of myself, multiple wives, and multiple children so that none would go hungry or live in poverty, why should I be prevented? Many people who argue against polygamy bring up vague statements about morals and religion, however when you look across many religions histories  you find polygamy to be present. From Islam, to Catholicism, to Judaism, to the obvious one of Mormonism. Two of the greatest kings according to religions of the God of Abraham are David and Solomon who are estimated to have 30 and 700 wives respectively. 

Also don’t get me misconstrued, I’m not just arguing for polygyny, while I do not see myself being interested in polyandry, I find that there should be no prevention of it. 

It’s not like making polygamy legal would be the end of monogamy. I feel like polygamy should be treated like many things in society: if you don’t like or agree with it, then don’t do it.

I have the perfect argument in favor of legal abortion.,"This argument grew out of the Violinist argument that many people still disagree with because the issue of ""nothing you did made the Violinist need a transplant"" so let me take it one step further as I present my own Car Crash Argument for why abortion should be legal even if we give a fetus all the same rights we give a fully grown person...

Lets say I take some time and build a car like the one in Deathproof, a car where if I’m involved in a collision there is next to no chance of injury for myself.

I build this car, and then I decide that its time for me to have some horribly evil with it.

So I drive it out on the highway, pull a crazy U-turn and then proceed to have a head to head collision with someone else at high speed.

Because I’m in my special car I’m not hurt in the slightest.

The person I slam into however suffers various damages including both of their kidneys are crushed/perforated with debris to the point that if they don’t receive a transplant they will die.

I was directly responsible for the accident.  I engaged in KNOWING behavior that caused the accident. Assuming I’m a match, can the court find that I must be forced to donate a kidney to the person that I injured?

If the court can't... doesn't this prove a person A's right to bodily autonomy trump's person B's right to life, even if person A is directly responsible for person B being put in a position where they might die?

Right now in our society we value bodily autonomy, a lot.  Consider the fact that people have to explicitly agree to be organ donors; a dead person has no conceivable need of their organs but we're willing to let living people die for lack of a transplant, rather than simply have removing a dead person's organs and shipping any still healthy ones off to look for matches to be part of standard hospital procedure.

As in the case above which does not allow for the criminals organs to be harvested against his will despite him being directly responsible for victim's need for a transplant, bodily autonomy takes precedence over right to life.  Thus even if we assume that the fetus has a right to life equal to that of a fully grown person, and we assume that the mother is directly and knowingly responsible for placing the fetus into a situation where it will die without the aid of someone else's organs; the mother's right to bodily autonomy trumps it, which is why abortion should be legal.

To illegalize abortion would require granting the fetus special rights that we don't grant any other person, and it would dehumanize women into walking wombs whose right are now less than those of men (as there is no situation where a man's bodily autonomy can be violated) which in turn would go against my current approach to understanding the principle of ""all men are created equal"" to mean ""all humans are created equal"".

The only paths to a society without delinquents are either a) let children be raised by professionals instead of parents; or b) make developmental psychology &amp; parenting (subjects from psychology and teaching college programs) mandatory for everyone.,"Background: not native English speaker, middle child in a family of 6 (2 parents, 4 children), college degree in Primary School Teaching, Bachelor degree in Teaching Psychology.   
   
Through my life, I have personally witnessed, encountered, and had a close contact with cases of suboptimal/less than desireable/neglective/absent parenthood: children that are manipulators, school bullies, shut-ins, outcasts, violent, overprotected, underprotected, etc, etc, etc.   
   
As it often stands, a child is the reflection of his family and surroundings: study the child long enough, and you will have a good grasp on what his parents do or don't do. I have observed these cases through my school years, and studied them as separate subjects in college and uni.   
   
One of the main things in human society is that parenting is a human right: anyone can have children, no holds barred, no hard requirements, no serious restrictions. At the same time, people miss the fact that knowledge on how to *bring up* children is not ""included in the package"": even if you have concieved a child, you don't get suddenly get knowledge on what to do with this new person. And parroting the models of your own parents is the reason why so many psychological traumas ""run through the family"", and why you can trace conflicts between parents and children by triangulating the parent's genealogy tree.   
   
And here is where it gets interesting:   
   
1) People can always agree that some people are bad at parenting and should not be parents at all - and it is obvious. Otherwise, revocation of parental rights wouldn't be a thing, and juvenile protective services wouldn't exist.   
   
2) It is general consesus that the number of bad parents can be changed if more people are educated on the matter.   
   
3) It is *also* general consesus that it is *impossible for every single parent to get a psychology degree:* they generally don't have the time, or resourses, or mental capacity, or f###s to give. And the enviroment also factors into this: survival leaves no room for good thoughts.   
   
   
Modern parenting is a system that is suboptimal in design.   
   
It *is* improvement over what we had before, but it is still *flawed.* It still produces undesireable results at a constant - albeit low - percentage.   
   
The end goal of every system is *perfection* - a system with an effectiveness close to 100%.   
   
In case of parenting, the factor that prevents the system from improving is parental unprofessionalism.   
   
My opinion is, eradication of this plight could be achieved in one of 2 ways:   
   
A) Make developmental psychology &amp; parenting part of mandatory education.   
   
That way, people will have no choice *but* to get good.   
    
   
B) Abandon the notion that parents are inherently knowledgeable, and let their children be raised by professionally educated people. 
   
   
Other than that, I see no other method to improve.",ew63sv,"There is no such thing as the ""better parent."" Some people are better parents for some children and other people are better parents for other children.

I want to start off by saying I do not think the girl with down syndrome should be excluded from the yearbook photo for her perspective squad. If she didn't make varsity and was on the backup squad then her photo should be on the squad that her skills allowed her to participate at. Which it seems is what happened from the article.

America would struggle to adopt socialised healthcare,"I'm from the UK, so this is coming from the perspective of someone who has only really had to pay for dental work and prescriptions- everything else has been free at the point of use. I do pay for it of course, because I pay a tiny part of the tax that funds it. If I have the money, I'm entirely free to pay for medical services privately, but this does not change my entitlement to NHS care.

Now as someone who grew up under this system, the benefits are fairly obvious to me. I have faced every medical event in my life- from childhood ear infections and dings to treatment for various problems that have beset me as an adult- without the anxiety of a bill or insurance payments. My mum had a series of heart attacks and a cardiac arrest and ended up in a London teaching hospital a few years ago- a world class facility that's known for the kind of heart surgery she needed. I tried to add up the possible costs- ambulance rides, two operations, intensive care for weeks, medication, rehabilitation, nurse visits, psychiatric referral... I stopped counting at about £300,000.

With these wonders though comes the shady side. I've worked in healthcare and the emergency services so I'm aware of how much the NHS is abused. People asking the doctor to prescribe painkillers that are available cheaply over the counter for 50p, so it costs them nothing but the NHS will pay about £7. Ringing for an ambulance because you feel that your minor ailment can't wait for a doctor's appointment, wasting hundreds of pounds in the process. Wandering into accident and emergency because you're drunk and can't feel your eyeballs and demanding to be seen so belligerently that you're thrown out by security. Drip drip drip, money wasted all the time. And in my experience, the people who are most guilty of this financially contribute to society the least.

People do complain about this, the NHS has been systematically underfunded for a long time and is struggling in a way that's really visible to people. Every story about some arse who's driven drunk and required the attention of all three emergency services reinforces the idea that in some ways the system isn't *fair*.

And that's what I think Americans struggle with. Most of the objections to socialised healthcare that I've seen are preoccupied with the idea that some people just don't deserve the same standard of healthcare as others they deem more worthy of help. It is difficult to consider that someone who, for example, has wrecked themselves through drugs will burn through much more money on medical treatment and rehab than he'll ever pay in. That's the problem if you have something like the NHS in place- it covers everyone. The lazy, the malicious, the timewasters, murderers... everyone.

That seems to be something many Americans can't swallow. And I do see their point of view- does that alcoholic deserve that liver? Does that terrorist suspect who's managed to blow chunks off himself with a home made bomb- should he be rushed into surgery over the people he targeted?

I will always defend socialised healthcare, and I wish the US would embrace it. People in the UK are very proud of it, and it's our largest employer so it's something people feel very involved in. But it's part of our culture, and I'm not sure it would fit into US culture in the same way.",gnkjkc,"&gt; Most of the objections to socialised healthcare that I've seen are preoccupied with the idea that some people just don't deserve the same standard of healthcare as others they deem more worthy of help.

Very important distinction here. I don't think anyone doesn't deserve the same standard of care. I just don't want to pay for it. The alcoholic can have that liver...if he can pay for it.

Interest free student loans are still a bad idea,"Change my view
In my country, student debt is interest free indefinitely, meaning if you borrow 20000$, that's the amount that you have to pay back over however long you want and if you die, it's written off. Nothing more or less. 
Some people think interest free debt is okay to accumulate when you account for inflation and wages go up but the student loan remains the same.

Gender Critical feminists are right about gender and sex,"Someone linked to r/gendercritical in a discussion to show how crazy and wrong they were. What I found instead was a logically consistent view of sex and gender.

The argument, as I've understood it goes like something like the following. Sex is biological and immutable. The terms 'man' and 'woman' refers to adult humans and their respective biological sex.  

Gender refers to the roles and expectations prescribed by society on people based on their sex. (e.g women use makeup and men wear ties.) Gender is cultural, changes and is ultimately arbitrary. You're not a man because you choose to wear a tie.

This distinction between gender and sex seems logically consistent and the definitions seems clear. It enables organisation against sexbased oppression and resistance against restrictive gender roles.

According to some, your gender instead is what you identify as. If you claim to be a woman you are one, regardless of your biology. If being a man or woman then has nothing to do with either biology or the prescribed gender roles the concepts are rendered meaningless. Why worry about what you identify as if man or woman is nothing more then a title? This does not seem like a coherent idea to me.

Alternatively man and woman refers to a persons adherence to, or perhaps fondness of, the cultural and arbitrary manifestations of gender. If you act out the role of a man or woman you are one. With this view, the concept of man or woman is reduced to stereotypes. This is the opposite of what feminists have spent decades fighting for.

This view is not popular and I would love to have it challenged. Please let me know if some parts of my argument is confusing or if I'm missrepresenting something and I'll try to elaborate.",do6b3v,"**Note:** Your thread has **not** been removed.

The Majority of American Jews are racially White Americans,"Before I state why I think most Ashkenazi Jews are racially White by American standards, let me explain my overall viewpoints on Race.

&amp;#x200B;

Racial classification in both the USA and other New World countries has always been a tricky and inconsistent thing. That is because racial caste systems were originally only made with three groups in mind, Free Whites, Black Slaves, and Savage Native Americans. Over time, the racial system had to change in order to adapt to the influx of people around the world like poorer parts of Europe, Middle East, East and South Asia, etc. Originally, Whiteness was about being a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant. So thanks to old prejudices, many European groups like Italians and Irish people weren't considered ""lesser Whites"".  As time moved on, all European groups were allowed to assimilate thanks to shared background and desire to grow and expand the White American population. Over time though, not only has the standards for Whiteness changed, but the fundamental characteristics of Whiteness were modified also.

&amp;#x200B;

From the early days of the USA up until the 1960s, being White was a legal designation. For long stretches of U.S. History, only people that were declared officially White were allowed to immigrate and naturalize in the United States. This allowed Western Europeans to come on mass, Southern and Eastern Europeans to still come (but they had quotas and other restrictions imposed on them) and various Asian groups like Chinese people and Indian people were restricted from coming to the USA at all (or becoming citizens if they were already here). With a Court case in 1915, Syrians and other Middle Easterners were considered racially eligible for Whiteness and naturalization. This legally expanded Whiteness from WASPs to Western Europeans to Europeans to general, to pretty much anybody who were visually similar to British people in the slightest way. The original one exception to this phenotype rule were mixed-raced people. Due to purity laws that established one-drop-rules, people who had as little as 1/8th African or Amerindian ancestry were declared to be legally the inferior race and were barred from inter-racially marrying with White Americans. All of that came to an end though during the Civil Rights Movement, which ended quotas and anti-miscegenation laws, made racial discrimination in various spheres illegal, and overall made Whiteness defunct as a legal category (but not as a sociocultural or demographic category).

&amp;#x200B;

Since being White didn't officially have any benefits anymore, the racial identification in the U.S. Census changed. Originally, the census-taker had to look at a person and write their race down when feeling out the racial demographics for a county. In the late 20th Century, this moved to a self-identification system where people filled out the censuses themselves. Race one again transformed itself, this time into a more informal system based mainly on identities and interpersonal interactions. There was still racial injustices abound, but it has moved to more imperceptible spheres like racial profiling, adverse impacts, conscious and unconscious biases, informal segregation, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, that is enough of racial history for today. I mainly brought it up to demonstrate how race evolves from era to era in multiple ways. Race is a social construct that changed from the 1900s compared to the 1800s, and changed again from the 2000s compared to the 1900s. Race in America nowadays mainly persists when it comes to social interactions and demography. So taken to its logical conclusion, I believe that race in the 21st Century is wholly decoupled from ethnicity or nationality or ancestry and is overwhelmingly appearance based. If you look White (meaning you can pass for European in public), you are White, simple as that. This is not to say that any White-looking person has an easy life (I have seen too many White Homosexuals get hated on to say that) or that every European-looking person is automatically privileged, but what I am saying is that anybody who looks close enough to European can access White Privilege. Most of the racial prejudice nowadays takes place at the first impression levels like how the police or employers or neighbors or judges or others perceive you. Since this is purely based on phenotype now, aspects like ancestry or cultural background only play an indirect role at best, not a direct role in determining race (which is an identity foisted on people by society, not a characteristic people themselves decide). This also means that since race is mainly based on appearance, race is now socially decided on an individual level and not on a collective level. This means you can no longer make blanket statements like ""Kurds are White"" or ""Egyptians are non-White"", instead you would have to examine the individuals of those background to determine if they look White enough or that. At best, you could say something like ""The vast majority of  Serbians look White"", or ""I have never seen a White Mongolian"".

&amp;#x200B;

Now anyway, about Jews. After seeing a large number of Jews in real life, and seeing Synagogue photos, I have come to the conclusion that the majority of American Jews are White. Yeah, I know, they have a different ethnic and cultural background than most White Americans, but if a man straight from Ukraine immigrated to the USA, he would be a different ethnicity than most White Americans too, but he would still probably be White. That is because being White is about how others identify you. You generally don't tell people what your race is (unless you look really ambiguous) they figure it out based on how you look (and maybe sound) alone. I also know that Jews have gone through a lot in hard times in their history and may feel more in common with Non-Whites due to persecution, but the thing is being White doesn't make you immune to hardship. Plenty of European groups like the Bosnians and the Greeks were genocided during the 20th Century despite most of them looking White. A lot of the persecutions Jews faced in the past were also in Europe or Asia (places without the racial caste system America has due to having different demographics), not in the USA. Not to say there has never been anti-semitism in America, but the anti-semitism in USA was generally against the Jewish religion, not the Jewish race since many Jews can pass for White and converted Jews are generally assimilated.

&amp;#x200B;

So to change my view, you have to either convince me that most American Jews are as racially distinguishable from White Americans as East Asians and South Asians are, or you have to convince me that Jews are still socioculturally a different race from White Americans despite the fact that most Jews look White.",drsc9d,"You list at least four different definitions of ""being white""

"Copyright in the US and around the world should be 20 years, and not 75+ years","The intended purpose of copyright is to give an incentive to create content. But if you can't turn a profit in the first 2 decades then tough, your content wasn't very good. But the larger purpose of having a lengthy copyright is not to incentivize content, but amass a huge library that in aggregate can still be profited from long after the original artists have likely moved on to other projects.

The obvious downside is that there would be that financing of content would be disrupted; there wouldn't be the willingness to sink costs upfront if there wasn't a chance for a lifetime of income from the copyright. But I believe that this discourages content since content creating companies become overly dependent on their catalog of content rather than create new material. I understand that making Friends and Seinfeld, along with the Beatles and Notorious B.I.G.'s  entire discography public domain would be the upside, but what major downside would there be if the copyright would be limited to 20 years. I'm not attached to the set years of copyright, so that's going to be pedantic if you try to argue with me about it being 20 years but 30 years instead. I want see why if any reason that we should continue to have Steam Boat Willie not in the public domain, and congress extending the copyright length every couple of decades since we are going to be due for another extension soon.

hristians should not vote for Republicans,"Christians have been popularized for being extremely pro-Republican for quite a long time pretty accurately based on polling numbers.

It is understandable that the pro-life/choice used to be the main fuel for them to support Republicans and was one of the main starts to all of this.

They should be the ones on the forefront asking politicians for ""socialist"" programs to try to help people. They are supposed to help the poor,underprivileged, and unfortunate people.

Nuclear power literally has no downsides,"Radiation!!! Chernobyl!!!!! The reactor went boom because crazy atoms were flying around doing radiation stuff!!! 

People usually try to make the point that nuclear energy is bad just because nuclear = radiation and radiation = Chernobyl. Turns out everything is radioactive, for example bananas are 1000× more radioactive than any other fruit. Do bananas turn you into an irradiated corpse? No! 

Nuclear power stations work by heating water which then turns into gas and spins a spinny wheel creating electric energy via spinning magnets. Turns out that almost every power station does that! The only thing different is the source of the spinniness - hydroelectric have water, wind turbines have the wind, thermal have coal and nuclear have uranium.

The source of the heat is the radiation from uranium. But what about, gasp, Chernobyl?!?! Chernobyl had an idiot in charge and said idiot was being an idiot and ignored every single hazard. The power plant was also in a pretty bad condition. Modern nuclear power plants have a lot of regulations and humans have figured out that it is usually not a good idea to put idiots in charge nuclear reactors. 

The only thing that is actually a bit worrying about nuclear energy is the waste it produces. It will last for a long time, but what about it? The simplest solution would be to just store it in abandoned mines, but you could do the thing that Finland is doing and build a huge underground facility to store the waste. A bit over the top in my opinion, but still very cool. 

In this process, there is nothing that is worse than any other form of energy, the downsides I will list for the big ones. 

Solar power: only accessable at day, very small output
Wind: high cost, small output
Water: needs big rivers
Coal: CO2 emmisions, not reusable

Nuclear power has none of that! Not only is it the safest and produces the most power, but it is also as ecological as any power plant reliant on reusable resources. True, nuclear power consumes the uranium, but it consumes it really slowly and we have a ton of uranium. 

If you see a problem with my reasoning, please tell me.",srvip8,"Honestly I’m confused why people believe there won’t be another incident. Given enough time, even the nearly impossible becomes a certainty. As long as we have nuclear power plants, there will *eventually* be another incident. The only questions are when and how bad.

"If god is omnipotent and omniscient and creator of everything, it would have to be incredibly cruel.","Omnipotent would mean it can do anything in the system it created. Omniscient would have to mean it can completely predict anything that happens in the system it created. Created everything means it created every system there is. 

Combine these two, then the sufferings in the world have to be permitted  in some way by god, even if you call it not intervening. Because it will be able to predict the sufferings beforehand based on the kind of system it's creating. After that, not doing anything while being able to do is cruel. To make matters worse, If god created everything, every kind of suffering there is, the possibility of them would also have to be created by it and that potential seen beforehand.

Thank you.

Up until now, the responses i've seen can be summarized into this -

Whatever sufferings we ""perceive"", is needed by this creator figure for it's goal, a goal none of us has the ability to comprehend but is likely moral.

My response - We are talking about an omnipotent, omniscient being that created everything about reality. A reality we (every life) experience. A lot of sufferings are part of this experience. Whether they are only from our perspective, a creator that created everything in reality, including our mind, would still predict and design what this sufferings are and what they feel like or at least things that make them possible. So, whether there's an ultimate reason or the nature of sufferings is subjective, the sufferings and the way It's felt by life is still there and is the result of a being, that would have to be the prime example of free will, acting the way it wants. Want, not need. So, criticism like this is still valid. 
An analogy - You create some beings, in what is a fully controlled and predictable environment to you. These beings experience something similar to sufferings. End justifies the means doesn’t make you choosing to start this (not needing) and allowing, even if subjective ailments, not cruel. For the fact that your hand wasn’t forced and the sufferings of your subjects, had to be knowingly signed of by you.",czhfhg,"I can see your point, but as the founding fathers thought, we were given natural rights, and that god just created the engine upon which Earth runs.

"[LOTR] Eagles flying the one ring into Mordor was at least as viable a plan as the Fellowship plan, is a plothole, and the only reason it wasn't at least attempted/discussed is because if it succeeded it would have made for a much shorter, less epic story."," Casual Tolkien fan here. I've seen all the films, read the biggies like LOTR and the Hobbit, listened to a few podcast channels, and spent a decent amount of time on wikis and Tolkien related subreddits, but thats it. 

In the Tolkien community ""why didn't they eagles just take the ring to Mordor,"" probably mostly prompted by people who watched ROTK and saw giant eagles stroll casually into Mordor to rescue Sam and Frodo from the erupting slopes of Mount Doom, seems to be widely regarded as a stupid, trite question.

A whole laundry list of reasons why this wouldn't have been a viable plan are invariably given: 

- The eagles might not have agreed to it 

- Sauron might have seen them 

- They might have had to fight Nazgul on or off Felbeasts 

- Orcs might have shot them down 

- The eagles might have been corrupted by the ring 

Etc. 

And these are all valid points. BUT equally valid points apply to the Fellowship plan and indeed any other plan to destroy the one ring that could have been concocted. There were no good, solid, foolproof plans. All of them were fraught with danger and risk and a high likelihood of not succeeding unless a thousand different rolls of luck and skill were completed successfully. Indeed, its easy to imagine an alternate universe where the eagles had destroyed the one ring where someone asked something like ""hey, why didn't they just send a ragtag team mostly comprised of totally untrained and inexperienced Hobbits to *walk* the Ring across  1,300 miles of perilous and hostile territory, sneak into Mordor somehow, and destroy it that way?"" and you'd have a bunch of Tolkien fans listing off the thousand and one reasons why such a plan isn't viable and would have failed, just like they currently do with the eagle plan. And, ironically, several of those reasons would be identical: Nazgul, being seen, being attacked by orcs, corruption, etc. 

Now, to get a tad conspiratorial, I think the reason that the eagle plan is so vociferously ""debunked"" by Tolkien fans isn't in fact because its such a stupid suggestion, as they almost invariably seem to pretend, but because it was *at least* if not more viable than the Fellowship plan and the fact it wasn't even *discussed* by the Council as a possible plan actually represents a fairly glaring plot hole in the LOTR story, and the reason Tolkien didn't pick it (or even consider it) has nothing to do with in-universe realities making the plan not viable, but simply that it would have made for a much more dull and quick story of how the ring was destroyed, rather than the epic trilogy that Tolkien actually wanted to write. And the reaction is understandable - nobody likes having plot holes in their beloved fiction pointed out, especially one thats so obvious even some non fan who has only half watched of ROTK once might notice. I think that this is why there is such animosity towards people asking that question - its not that its stupid, but rather that it exposes a likely flaw in Tolkien's work and Tolkien fans don't tend to like that.",k8sc69,"Well, wouldn't the simplest reason be Gandalf knows the existence of Nazgul and knows that Sauron's Eye is pretty much next door to Mount Down and Nazguls like to hang around there be a good reason enough? 

Gandalf however didn't know about Saruman's corruption (and hence being forced to go through the Mines of Moria), Gondor Steward being morose, Theodon's corruption, Gollum is missing in action, etc. Gandalf has also has experience with Hobbits being a particulary stealthy bunch.

Is the simple answer just simple information gap? We as a repeat reader of LOTR don't suffer from this.

I mean you appear be aware that the Eagle Plan has gaps but shouldn't it just be compared with what they knew at the time when they chose their approach .. which is get to friendly Gondor with some friendly groups nearby and see what happens? 

Would a single throwaway line that ""we cannot fly there"" be that much influential as to close this ""plot hole""? Had Tolkien wrote such a line over 50 years ago, some random person will still argue that the Eagle plan is actually so much better for A-Z reasons and that they didn't conclude it's a better plan is a ""plot hole"". I personally expect a higher threshold for things to be considered a ""plot hole"".",gezz5f7,5.0
"Every smoker started smoking because they thought it was ""cool"" or because they just wanted to fit in.","First time I tried smoking in high school, it was it of curiosity. I never got past a few puffs. 

Second time it was during dinner with friends when everyone at the whole damn table walked outside to smoke leaving me by myself. I followed them out just to chat and they gave me a cig. 

It was then that I realized that becoming a smoker takes dedication. You can't just start smoking out of curiosity. It's painful, gross, and hard to get used to. You have to be a try hard to be a smoker. There is literally no reason to start smoking unless you're fully convinced that it's a ""cool"" thing to do and you make yourself believe that you need to do it to fit in. 

I concede that there are exceptions for people whose well-being might be threatened if they don't smoke in order to fit in. (e.g. getting bullied for not fitting in; losing clients because they can't smoke with them during business; you're literally a spy, etc)

I get that smoking is addictive and their marketing is very predatory. If you're having a hard time quitting I feel bad for you but you probably started smoking for vain reasons. 
People often say they smoke to relieve stress. Yeah but you never felt it's effects before you started. You don't suddenly decide to force yourself to choke on smoke for a few days until you get used to it just because you're stressed. And it's almost impossible not to known about the health risks before you start. Not to mention the cost. If you heard that smoking helps with stress you probably also heard that exercise and meditation helps with stress. Why would you choose the unhealthy and costly option?

I had parents that smoked. Many of my friends I grew up with also smoked. I know of them were ever forced to smoke. I tried smoking a few times out of curiosity and peer pressure but had no trouble dropping it and just never getting addicted. It's not like my life was stress free (deadbeat dad left us, debt collectors, poverty, yadda-yadda).

Help me understand why there are still so many people starting to smoke and why I shouldn't view majority of smokers as vain assholes who couldn't handle a little peer-pressure or got convinced by some stupid marketing that it's cool to slowly get lung cancer.

Change my view.

Edit:

I've expanded my view of non-vain reasons for starting to smoke and thus have awarded deltas. 

I still believe the vast majority of smokers started because they gave in to slight peer pressure or got fooled by marketing. Both of which appeal to your sense of vanity. 

Peer-pressure that comes with dire consequences is not really peer-pressure, that's pretty much coercion. Again, I find this to be a rare exception to my argument (it might be rampant perhaps in some business sectors, in which case I concede a blanket exception). The majority of smokers chose to prioritize fitting in over their health, which is what I find vain.",dhkidw,I started smoking (15ish) because it’s a much more social acceptable method of self harm then cutting yourself.

Human life is fundamentally more important than animal life.,"I saw several posts today claiming that pro-lifers are hypocrites for wanting to save human life but condone meat eating and animal farming. I am not a pro-lifer and m very much pro choice but I believe that to equate human beings and a woman’s right to choose to factory farming is nonsensical. It’s a whataboutism to the 100th degree.

Human life is more than any animal and I would save a human being over an animal  10/10 because fundamentally we as people have the responsibility to do more for each other than any other animal. While animal can provide companionship and love, there is nothing that compares to the complexity of human to human relationships and our emotions se us far apart from any other animal on this planet.

Elian Gonzalez was illegally taken and deported by the U.S. government,"This happened 20 years ago, and I'm going strictly by memory here, so it should be fairly easy to change my view if you're able to identify facts that I'm relying on that turn out to be factually incorrect.

My view basically boils down to this:  The immigration policy from Cuba at the time was ""one dry foot"".  Any Cuban national who made it to dry land in the United States would be legally permitted to stay in the United States.  Clearly, Elian qualified under this criteria.

Elian himself, though only 6 years old, had expressed an interest to stay in the United States.  He was with relatives.  His mother had died while trying to escape to the U.S.  There is no rational argument that he was being held against his will, although there is a rational argument that he may have been being manipulated (as he was only 6 years old).

From what I recall, the argument at the time was that ""the boy should be with his father"" and his father certainly wanted to take the boy back to Cuba.  That is a valid argument and I have no disagreement with anyone who posed that argument.

But because of the immigration policy in place and because Elian had provided at least some indication of a desire to remain in the U.S., he should have been granted an immigration hearing to determine whether he should be legally permitted to remain in the U.S., or be forcibly deported by the U.S. Government.  Instead, he [was taken by jack-booted thugs in the middle of the night](https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EU2PLBAPSUI6VESMWNGQTO6JJA.jpg) and sent back to Cuba (possibly) against his own wishes.

Now, there were \*some\* hearings as I recall, but there was never an immigration hearing for Elian where a court ordered he be deported.  So simply pointing to certain hearings that happened will be unlikely to change my view.  He should not have been deported without first having the opportunity to make his case for immigrant status to a court.  Bill Clinton and Janet Reno denied him that opportunity.

**EDIT:**  I've had a few people suggest that minors are not permitted to legally seek asylum.  But no one suggesting this has provided a source for it.  I believe that a minor can obtain legal representation and that legal representative can seek asylum on behalf of the minor, even against the wishes of a parent or guardian.",hc0xw9,"The issue wasn't asylum, it was termination of parental rights.  In general, as a minor child your parents have the right to determine where you live.  Mom and dad want to move to New Mexico and you hate the desert and hate red and green chiles?  Tough luck.  

If his dad had custody and wanted to bring him back to Cuba, the government wouldn't just need to grant him asylum, it would need to strip his father's parental rights.  Asylum means you _can_ stay in the US.  But if you're granted asylum, you can still choose to leave if you want to.  If Elian's dad wanted to go back to Cuba, Elian having asylum status in the US wouldn't stop it.  And because he's a minor child, he has no say in that.

You'd need a separate and much harder process to take away the dad's right to choose where his family lives, or strip his rights entirely and move Elian to foster care.",fvcic5g,3.0
"police abolition is a naive pipe dream, even if it were somehow politically palatable.","This is more a discussion intended for those already somewhat Left-leaning, but I welcome other political points of view.  I keep seeing this push for police abolition (prison abolition as well, though that's perhaps a separate discussion) among some of the more radical Left and I'm wondering where this discourse is coming from. I prefer radical police reform, overall reduction and total cultural shift. Massachusetts is currently experimenting with such reforms with Crisis Intervention Training and the ""Memphis model"", though I think it will take a few years to see how effective it is. Brushing aside the question of whether the pipe dream is even remotely politically palatable for the majority of Americans who even among the Left did not vote for a progressive candidate in the last primary (though it may have in part been out of fear of Trump's reelection), I don't know if I'm 100% on board with abolition, because I tend to lean more socialist-Left than anarchist-Left, and it's difficult for to me to imagine a legitimate State without at least some means of enforcing the law (and yes, as Walter Benjamin argued, the very notion of enforcement already necessarily implies violence to some degree, and this is a tough pill to swallow even if such violence results in the greater good, which in the current case it doesn't seem to). That being said, there's good reason to believe that institutionalized systemic racism is the backbone of our criminal justice system, and many if not most problems can be solved without policing. But it seems naive to me to believe ALL problems can be solved without any means of enforcement. Even in a completely consensus-based anarchist commune setting, you still have the tyranny of the community or vigilantism to enforce or impose the law on individuals who violate or deviate from the accepted norm. Most of these communes are already self-selecting the best candidates to participate in this proactive form of participatory democracy, so they are not reflective of the population at large. To scale up from a tribal commune to the Nation State, I just don't see how it would function with absolutely no police. But hey, I am willing to entertain this idea. I would love to see if anyone can throw in some reading sources on case studies that might serve as counter examples. I've read some of the anarchist theories of David Graeber and have seen some examples he's provided of effective anarchist communities, but again, they're always operating small scale and seem to run counter to the norm. Whether this norm is a matter of social conditioning (e.g. the breakdown of family and our sense of community in society as sociologist Robert Putnam describes in Bowling Alone) and thus subject to change is a worthwhile question.  All that being said, I don't actually hold a negative Hobbesian view of human nature, as if the police are the only thing holding society up and without them we fall into some Wild West Walking Dead anarchy. I generally think most humans are well meaning, but maybe a little dumb, lazy, and imperfect, and government serves to account for complicated issues of mass coordination like the tragedy of commons dilemma, distribution of resources, etc.  I just think there are times when a professional cop is necessary for swift and immediate action, or for investigation of a crime (aside from their shoddy tactics of entrapment, forced confession via interrogation, etc.) There seem to be occasionally certain social problems and crimes (though seldom) that at the root cannot be fixed by merely medicalizing, or providing counseling services and proper healthcare and education to everyone in need.",gtzl64,"It seems to me that one of the very difficult problems to overcome in the US ( and I only say this as an impression as a foreign onlooker) is that the police go into every interaction thinking about whether they might be shot - and now so do many groups of civilians when they meet the police. It's difficult to see how the police could give up being armed and paranoid in such a society.  ( and I am not suggesting general gun restrictions because I dont think it's likely to happen politically or practically now. ) it almost feels like you need some Costa Rican solution- I believe they disbanded their army and just have a police force now because they were fed up with the problems the military causes in Central/South America (?). seems like the States could do with more local 'demilitarised' but not unarmed  forces which more closely represent and connect to the ( law abiding) community they serve in. But maybe I am seeing it incorrectly, not living there.",fsffw64,4.5
 there are no downsides to universal healthcare,"As a person on the internet in general I’m exposed to a lot of information about US politics in general. I am for the most part, interested seeing as I like hearing other people’s perspectives and learning. One hot button topic is obviously universal healthcare and healthcare/big pharma in general in the US.

I intended to post this on US politics or something like that cause I’m curious to hear opposing opinions as to why people are so against it, because in my mind and experience there’s so little cons (if any) and it baffles me that it’s just so contentious over there. 

I’m from New Zealand where we have tax payer funded healthcare, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. I can (and have in the past) show up to an Emergency Department at any time and be treated, and walk out without having to pay a single cent. It would cost me roughly $50 to see a GP (if I was on our equivalent of social welfare this would be less) though as a student I can walk into the University health centre and receive the same care (in my experience it was actually better, but that’s down to the GP I saw) for absolutely no cost. I could be diagnosed with cancer and I would be treated (standard course of treatment) for free. If I was involved in an accident my ambulance ride ($80) would be reimbursed and any follow up specialist care would be covered by ACC (Accident Compensation Corporation) so long as I fill out the form. Under 17s get free healthcare. Community mental and other health clinics/services for both kids and adults are also fully funded. Dental care is free under 18 as well. Government funded medication costs $5 which is the pharmacy fee, which many are waiving now. So at supermarket pharmacy’s and a few other places you can fill your prescriptions for free. As such, New Zealand had the lowest rates of medicine use in developed countries in 2010 as well as the lowest spending on healthcare US$2510 per capita (compared to US$7290 in the states.)

Private healthcare exists and is an option that many use. I’m an (admittedly young) adult but I’m fortunate to still be covered under my family’s health insurance, as are my younger siblings. My brother had a shoulder replacement surgery two years ago, in a private hospital covered by said insurance. My sister had pins become imbedded in her foot a few years ago and mum had no qualms about rocking up to the closest emergency department (a private hospital happens to be closer) and that care was covered too. If we need wisdom teeth out: covered. Experimental treatment beyond the standard course for cancer: covered. Seeing a specialist: covered. I know that when the time comes I will no doubt get my own private health insurance. So the argument that people would opt out of private health insurance in favour of just relying on public healthcare wouldn’t eventuate based on my experience and that of a lot of people here who have the option to do so, but simply don’t.

I just really struggle to see the downside of universal healthcare, mostly because I don’t know any better. Honestly? I don’t think you guys will change my view to the point that I’m anti-universal healthcare, but there has to be some flaws in it right? I’d love to be a bit more critical of it, and try to see the other side. So... try change my view",c93z53,"Asking Person A to pay for the poor life choices of Person B is contradictory to freedom of the individual.  

Since your post was really about the USA (which, due to the ACA, the majority of ppl are required to pay for health insurance, although its pro-rated, subsidized and not enforced) I must add that American is the most generous country on the planet.  In 2018 Americans gave $400B to charity (although most 'charity lists' rank the US lower, these lists are erroneous and count how many people or how many acts, not pure economic impact.) so you could say that Americans are compassionate as a whole.

But the problem is that we don't want to pay for a persons poor choices.  Is my tax money well spent on a smoker?  Obese person?  Addict?  Mentally ill person that refuses to take their medication?   The US does have 'sin' taxes', but they do not generate anywhere near the needed revenue needed by the individuals participating in the unhealthy activity.  How many packs of cigarettes do you have to smoke with a $5 tax to pay for one chemo treatment to try and cure self induced lung/throat cancer??

Also linking health insurance to work is a STRONG motivator to actually work.  What social good is derived by paying the health costs of an obese addict that doesn't work?  That same person can work, eat right, and get clean for free.

As an American, I don't think this is a uniquely American view.  

The USA leads the world in medical research.  The USA solves the worlds problems.  We can do that because there is a profit motive in doing so.  If the gov't ran 'health care' there would be incentive to fund research and worse, left wing/right wing group would object to something politically and the gov't would be unable to get anything done.  Relying on politicians to fund medical research is just a bad idea.  Sure, some Universities have research facilities, but the best and brightest scientists will go to the best employer to get a return on all that education they paid for.",et376l8,5.0
"Repeat Pedophiles, Rapists and Sex Offenders should have no human rights.","


First off I want to make things clear, I know people who know people that have been ""wrongfully"" convicted of a sex crime or crime against a child. And that's why I am saying REPEAT. Because I know that false convinctions happen. Okay so now that's clear. 
I think that Repeat Pedophiles, Rapists and Sex Offenders (I'll just say ""pedos"" from here on out) should have no human rights. For somebody to commit such a crime and be convicted of it multiple times imo forfeits their right to freedom and control over what happens to there body. I do think they should have food and water to keep them alive, but I do think they should be put in gen-pop in prisons, placed on suicide watch and be used as lab rats or subjects for expirementations and stop testing things on animals and start testing on pedos. I also think they should be castrated, chemically and physically. I want pedos to be alive and abused.

I know it sounds harsh but I've heard from family, friends &amp;amp; mutual friends and some strangers the horror and utter disgust of certain types of crimes commited by these pedos. I just want to know other peoples opinions on this and to see if I should change my view on this subject. Thank you in advance.

Edit: I just want to say that i know it would scar people and I understand that, but I feel that a ""pedo"" should have no right to protection. That's it.



I also would like to add some things I've been told of from my family member who is a former detectives and federal agent.

He one day decided to go to pick up his sister from school with her friend (sister age 10, sister's friend age 11). And he crashed the car killing his sister. He grabbed the friend and took her into an old building. Where he raped her, cut her hands off and pleasured himself with them. He cut her head of and used her mouth as a form of pleasure. When he was arrested he was screened by multiple shrinks. He had no form of sociopathy or personality disorders. He showed no signs of regret. He even bragged about his crimes. And went to prison he was ratted out and people did unspeakable things to him. They gave him food and kept him well fed.

It is perfectly fine to reject a partner based on body count.,"I know this is always a recurring topic but hear me out. This is simply a preference. I hate when I hear words like  'insecure, immature , judgmental' being used  to describe someone who has this preference.

Listen. When choosing a partner for sex versus one for a relationship we look at different qualities. When selecting a partner for a relationship, We may put emphasis on an emotional connection. We want to be able to relate to our partner in a relationship. If two separate parties have a different view on sex , there can be a form of disconnect. People should not be shamed for seeking a partner who views sex in the same light as themselves.",ch5145,"Lets look at this from a broader view - is body count really the issue? Say someone has a ""high"" body count but they are a drastically different person now than they were in the past, and actually have very similar views with you regarding sex and relationships.

Shared values are something that very few people will disagree with you on. But where you likely get pushback is if you suggest that a partner is somehow physically different because of the number of partners that they have had. You will also get significant pushback if you don't hold yourself to the same standard that you hold your potential partner to. It would be extremely hypocritical to not want a partner who had a similar ""body count"" to yours for example, because that shows that it has nothing to do with shared values.",euqjvq7,3.3333333333333335
DC statehood is an objectively bad idea.,"Attempting to make the District of Columbia a state is ignorant of both the constitution and how the the federal government operates. The District of Columbia is not a state for a reason. During the making of the constitution it was obvious the District of Columbia had to be a territory rather than a state. The District of Columbia is a city, nowhere near the size of a state and would have one of the lowest state populations. There seems to be the misconception that the District of Columbia doesn't have the right to vote, this is false. The 23rd amendment allows the District of Columbia to participate in presidential elections.

If the District of Columbia becomes a state they will have to elect a governor and have a state government. A state government would give a state complete control over the District of Colombia which has a 90% democratic population. The District of Columbia would always elect a democratic governor which would give democrats more control over the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia also has many government officials and employees so statehood would give the federal government more power in presidential elections.

"If all movies are subjective and can’t be bad, by the same token none can be good either","
Since there are still debates going on wether movies can be objectively viewed or if everything about them comes down to a subjective opinion, I would say that movies have to have some kind of objective quality to them, eg good writing, music ect or else nothing can actually be considered good. 


If movies are art and all art is subjective, and something that is subjective can’t be “bad” by the same token it can’t be “good”. 

The idea that we can’t look at things like writing, character development or story continuity and say wether it’s objectively sound is just stupid to me.

In some cases, sheer enjoyment or entertainment or emotional fulfillment is most important - here is where the ""subjective"" factor comes in most powerfully. Many films are designed to evoke an emotional reaction, and if someone reacted strongly to a particular film, no arguments about its character development or story continuity are likely to sway them otherwise. They're still going to like the film. 

However, you can be analytical about a film from a more ""objective"" level. You can ask what the film hopes to accomplish, what's its about, and how well it utilizes the medium of film to succeed in those goals. You can situate the film within a genre, looking at how it conforms to particular tropes or modifies them, or look at the film's place in film history or within the body of work of a particular actor or director. 

Even these types of analyses, while seemingly more objective, are still open to argument. People may not agree about what the film's goals are, or what the functions of particular aspects of the film are, or whether a film is truly subverting a trope of its genre. Things like that. This may be what people mean when they say it's still ""subjective"" - you can make objective arguments about a film, but there's still room for disagreement and debate.",fv5k839,2.5
There is nothing that the common man can currently do to change the trajectory of American politics,"I’m writing this because I have lost almost all faith in the various political systems of America. It seems as though there are many things that people SAY will bring change, but really do not do much of anything. My view will be changed if someone can provide one thing that someone who is not professionally involved in politics can do to create change. I’ll go through the things that people SAY can achieve this, but I personally believe do nothing.

1) Protesting:
This is one of the main methods that common people have tried using to combat poor action on the part of governmental organizations. From what I’ve seen, they’ve done basically nothing. Black Lives Matter protests, for example, have gone on for months, and the only changes I’ve seen have been some minor local changes by blue states. Nothing major at the federal level ever happened, which was the main goal of the protests. A similar situation exists for abortion rights protests, as those rights were recently drastically set back with the repeal of Roe v Wade. From what I’ve seen, the government has taken somewhat of a “weather the storm” approach to responding to protests. They wait for people to get tired or have other obligations that prevent them protesting, then carry on like nothing happened. It makes protests seem utterly useless in creating change, as no matter how loud those crowds are, nobody at the federal level seems to give a damn.
2) Voting:
This one is interesting, as it does technically give the individual a voice; however, that voice’s impact depends far too heavily on one’s location. Plus, with the amount of gerrymandering that occurs, along with the possibility of the Supreme Court overturning a case to give states further control over the electoral process, it seems like people’s individual votes, in the grand scheme of things, matter less than ever. As such, my view with voting is that while each vote does matter, they do not matter enough, as the best they can do is keep things from getting worse than they already are. Additionally, independents, one of the only viable escapes from the two-party system, are too unpopular for a vote for them to matter.
3) Writing to Politicians:
While writing to your local congressmen can be effective with less clear-cut issues, all of the major issues that people would want to voice their concerns over are far too partisan for congressmen to be swayed by someone writing in.

These are the possibilities that came up when I was trying to search for a way to change this viewpoint on my own, but all of them seem to have a fatal flaw that prevents me from seeing them as a clear way for someone like myself to do something that can create change. I’m hopeful that this view can be changed.",vqfs27,"Something that I do is working with a group focused on a narrow issue.

And now she was stuck looking after two kids, and she couldn’t.

So I was working part time at 14, and I bought my clothing and food since then, and I started working full time at 16, paying my way and helping to pay the rent on a shit trailer in a trailer park in a poor little Texas town. 

I have changed careers four times, now spending the last 15 in IT, and now I work IT security and I make good money. No college, started in poverty, fighting my way up on a GED.

And I have had to fight my way to where I am, out working and out hustling people for jobs and promotions.

All on my own? No. But in a world where people borrow money for a degree that has them making better money than me, and with socialists who whine that nobody is giving them money for co-ops, I don’t mind telling people that I worked my way up.

If my son graduates high school, he will be the first in my blood family. If he even attends college, he will be the first in my blood family. I didn’t have any family wealth, there is no inheritance waiting when my parents die. I am the product of a poor broken home, alcoholic and physically abusive dad, and a mom with some mental issues. What we are often arguing against is the argument that we succeeded because of arguments like yours, that there have to have been some break along the way.

Me getting an entry level job for $11 an hour signing people into a data center and rebooting servers? That wasn’t a break, that was a job, and a lot of people came and went doing that job. I learned. I learned networking and Linux, I learned our policies and procedures. When other people took their birthday off I worked the OT for them, when other people plaid video games I studied, and I moved past them, managing the NOC after five years and the data center after eight. 

The breaks you think must be hidden in the story are the breaks we all get, we just don’t all make use of them.

When I say I pulled myself up I mean it. I come from nothing, a poor family with nothing, finding my current career at 36 when people thought I was too old to start. Like has sucked for much of my life. I’m married but it hasn’t always been good or easy. I have two kids, and they are the best part of my life to this point, but I was quite poor when they were born, it was a hard time. 

I have seen my dad and other family members suffer with alcohol addiction, and in my teens I had that as well. I have had problems with self confidence and I have contemplated ending it a few times, but I didn’t. I got back up and went back to work. I have crashed and burned, I was laid off, at one point I drove a truck for 16 months when I thought I was out of IT for good.

The reality is that you insisting that somehow a break was responsible is absurd, we have all had breaks, all of us. Some of us worked harder and did more with the breaks we all get.",iadlyyp,3.0
Dental insurance is a complete racket,"The fact that a hefty proportion of dentists will bill patients and/or their insurers for treatment that isn't needed or overcharge for services provided is a given in the US.

But sleezy dentists aside, dental insurance is a complete and total rip-off.

I'm not 100% convinced health insurance isn't a scam, but I don't see how vision insurance can be anything *but* a scam, and dental insurance has **got** to be a racket.

If I go in for a couple cleanings and an ex-ray every year, I could spend anywhere from $200 to $250. If I need more care than that, I might spend as much as $1000 or more on dental care.

With dental insurance, you pay a monthly premium $25-$50/mo. About $350 a year. If you need a procedure, simple things like fillings are covered after a deductible of $50-$100, and more complex procedures will be 25%-35% covered ... but past a certain point, generally $1000-$2500, they pay nothing.

It isn't like health care, where they only start kicking in after a certain point. No, the more you spend, the less they cover! And they say the dental insurance companies negotiate pricing, but the fact is, you're just as likely to be tied into a network of over-priced dentists or dentists who jack their prices up for insured patients.

If you only need cleanings and an x-ray every now and then, you pay more on premiums than you would to the dentist, but if you need serious work, you're still on the hook for most of it. There is a very skinny window where you might come out ahead on a given year, and wide swaths where you wind up spending at least a little more every year.

That's how they stay in business. If the customer came out on top, how could they still exist? I don't understand why anyone gets dental insurance.

Convince me to pay a dental premium.

EDIT: Big  **Δ**  for the following cases, which don't apply to me, but may make dental insurance not a **complete** racket

* Bigger families,
* older people or people with bad teeth/dishonest dentists
* people whose employer covers much of the premium.
* People whose medical insurance doesn't cover chipped/broken teeth",g4zx1j,"Dental insurance is *insurance*. It is there for the major events, rare events, and expensive events. If you only look at *routine* costs for *healthy* people who are *lucky*, then no type of insurance is worth it.

So to see how dental insurance benefits you, we have to look at an expensive event.

Let's say you have a bad cavity and lots of pain. You need to get it checked out before you know what your options are. The dentist then tells you that you have 2 options: 1) pull the tooth, or 2) root canal and filling. If you want the filling, you have another couple of options: a) metal cap, or b) ceramic cap that looks like natural tooth. Of course, you'll have to get your teeth cleaned before either option in order to reduce infection, and you'll have to come back on a scheduled day. Plus, all root canals have a chance of failure. If you want to reduce those risks, there are additional surgical/implant options.

So now you are looking at: 2 visits, 1 cleaning, and 1 surgical procedure. What are the potential costs?

**Without Insurance:**

|Procedure|Cost|Insurance|Out of Pocket|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Premium|0|\---|0|
|2 Visits|$100 each|\---|$200|
|Cleaning|$150|\---|$150|
|Tooth extraction|$400|\---|$400|
|Root canal and metal|$1,100|\---|$1,100|
|Root canal and ceramic|$1,300|\---|$1,300|
|Other: (implant, build up, restoration)|up to $2,000|\---|up to $2,000|
|||||
|Total Range|$750 (extraction) to $3,650 (full restoration)|||

&amp;#x200B;

**With Insurance:**

|Procedure|Cost|Insurance|Out of Pocket|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Premium|$350|$100 deductible, $3,000 yearly cap|$350|
|2 Visits|$100 each|\-$180 (one free visit, then $20 copay after)|$20|
|Cleaning|$150|\-$150 (one free)|$0|
|Tooth extraction|$400|\-$240|$160|
|Root canal and metal|$1,100|\-$800|$300|
|Root canal and ceramic|$1,300|\-$960|$340|
|Other: (implant, build up, restoration)|up to $2,000|\-$1,520|up to $480|
|||||
|Total Range|$530 (extraction) to $1,190 (full restoration)|||

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

*After* the premium, insurance on a root canal procedure saves you between $200 and $2,500. Plus, if you look at the cost of the options, not having insurance means that restorative procedures aren't really an option.

So let's say you don't need a root canal every year, but you do use your free visit and cleaning. What's the net loss per year? $350 on insurance minus $250 saved on denitistry means you are overpaying $100 per year.

So if you overpay $100 every year for 24 years, then get 1 root canal with full restoration, you have broken even. Plus you don't have to worry about having cash on hand at the time of the root canal, plus you have healthier teeth for those 24 years.",fo358dx,2.0
I should not start meditating because it would just be one more thing for me to be inadequate at.,"I have heard many people talk about the benefits of meditation and I do not doubt them. However, I feel that for me personally, it would do me more harm than good as it would just give me one more thing to be inadequate at. Hear me out.

Do I go to the gym and lift? Yes, a couple times per week, but not regularly enough to see substantial gains. I have some muscle tone  and am not overweight but I am not where I want to be either.

Do I run? Yes, several times per week but I stopped getting faster once I hit about the 8:30/ mile pace a while ago and cannot expect to make further gains or ever see the age group podium at an organized race unless I really rearranged my life in ways that are not feasible to make it a priority. 

Yoga? Yup, semi frequently but still cannot really get inversions dialed in without substantially more commitment. 

Walk the dog? See my friends? Maintain relationships? Ski? Yes to all of these but I am moderately good at best and won't be winning any awards or accolades any time soon. Anytime I only make it to yoga once per week, or only run 3 miles when I should have found the time for 5, I feel inadequate to the point that the sense of accomplishment is often overwhelmed by my own expectations to have done better, and I actually feel worse about myself. I feel that adding meditation to my already full exercise, athletic, and personal pursuits will actually just make me feel worse when I cannot get in as much as I know I should. Therefore, I should not start meditating, but would like to be convinced that it might actually help me more than hurt me.",k4p9ah,"Being lousy at something is the first step in being good at it. Also, moving meditation is a thing. Do pranayama breathing while you're doing the dishes and you can have the benefits of meditation and clean forks.

Mario Kart is the best political system.,"Mario kart is essentially a meritocracy where generally skill ensures you rise to the top of the pack. How it stops the skillful players from gathering a monopoly on power is through rainbow cubes. Each rainbow cube gives the person a random opportunity to further their progress, however the worst of you are doing, the greater chance of a very powerful opportunity that will even the playing field. Even going so far as to give you a blue shell which will specifically target the top spot.

&amp;#x200B;

This is fair because as soon as you use these advantages to advance to the top, then those same mechanics will be used against you! Thus ensuring a constant churn of players through the top spot where no single individual can hold the position indefinitely.

&amp;#x200B;

Even innate disadvantages like starting at the back of the pack of the start line means you will have greater opportunity to advance. 

&amp;#x200B;

However this doesn't completely even the playing field as players will still need to improve their skill and course familiarity in order to consistently get to the top spot.",hleg9m,"Very interesting analogy, but I'm not sure it applies to real life.

"I'm in a tough spot where I believe that freedom of speech, so long as no arrests are made, is still intact despite social media platforms banning people they don't like or people boycotting you","I'm flip flopping on what should or shouldn't be, so I'd like my view changed to that the censorship is a problem because, I genuinely am kind of worried and think censorship is bad, but I can't logically argue why. 

So the thing is, if I create a website where people can talk about dogs and only about dogs because I hate cats, and someone posts about cats, should I not be allowed to ban them?

So now comes stuff like reddit, facebook etc. While I find it immoral to not have a place for free open discussion, and many places like twitter are hypocritical, how can I justify it 'legally'?

What I mean is, freedom of speech (or in Canada, freedom of expression) is only about whether the police puts you in cuffs, not how businesses react. 

I would like our world for everyone to listen, but at the same time, I think the issue is the 'line'. I'm happy if everyone 'cancels' people who support Hitler's vision (exterminate jews) but I also ask, what if it's just something I disagree with. At what point are we not free?  
I think that's my trouble. People claim we aren't free when people are fired for their thoughts, and, in a way, I get it, but in away, it's hard for me to say they aren't free because just as they are free to speak, companies are free to fire, boycott etc.",t2ac75,"So mostly you’re talking about a much bigger issue than free speech. You’re wondering whether it’s ethical or not to be authoritarian, or to support an authoritarian society. The trouble with a big corporation in our society, is that it can oppress citizens perhaps even better than the state can. So while technically if Facebook bans me for saying the earth is flat or whatever, it isn’t denying my freedom of speech(as defined as the state censoring my speech), it’s still making a decision to oppress me and deny me personal liberty. There comes a certain point where an individual or a group of individuals becomes so powerful that you can’t really treat them as a person when it comes to their responsibility to society. You can’t own a company that controls all web searches and still claim that you’re just exercising your own personal rights when you dictate what results show up on your searches. 

So with that being said, if a corporation is as powerful as the state, how could it possibly be ethical for them to censor speech on their platforms? Authoritarian things are almost always bad, and almost always bring dread results to the population. If you’re ever in doubt over whether or not a company is acting ethically, just ask if they are taking away someone’s rights. Hold them to the same level of scrutiny as you would the state, because by their own machinations they’ve made themselves more powerful than the state.",hyl11yi,4.5
It's NOT incorrect to refer to the Monster as Frankenstein.,"It's very common to hear people lament the fact that someone has called the Monster (or Creature) - Frankenstein. They then proceed to educate the person that it was in fact the Doctor that was called Frankenstein. Even fancy dress shops sell Monster costumes under the name Frankenstein which upsets some people no end. 

However, I believe these people ""correcting"" everyone are all wrong.

In Chapter 16 of Frankenstein when The Creature is confronting Victor (the Dr) he says:

""At length the thought of you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you were my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life?""

The Creature considers himself the child of Victor Frankenstein. He self-identifies as a Frankenstein, and we think that choice should be respected. That’s why calling The Creature by that name isn’t actually incorrect. He thinks he is the son of Victor Frankenstein, so it makes sense that he would take that name. 

Change my view.",eg1x08,The real monster is actually Dr Frankenstein so o guess you're correct lol,fc4xcms,2.0
"should remove statues, should add plaques explaining what they did.","Every country had guys who did horrible things and we honor them because they helped build the country to what it is. We shouldn’t be removing them because of one thing. Life isn’t black and white no matter how hard we wish it to be.

Someone who did some good, and did a lot of horrible things will still be remembered if he helped the country succeed and prosper. What we should do is have these guys with plaques saying why they were originally honored, and why now they are seen as wrong.

Nearly every country, kingdom, and empire was built on slaves or treating people like slaves. We can’t go back rewrite stuff anymore. I’m Irish and I don’t like Cromwell for what he did to the Irish. Hell, the English monarchs did horrible things to the Irish. We were starved, sold into slavery, our land was sold, and we were still treated like shit in America and we helped build it as well. But I don’t want those things removed because I know it’s what made those countries successful. I would rather have a plaque next to them that explains they were men or women who were honored because it helped the country at the time, and they still did some horrible things so here is a plaque saying what they did.",h11ud2,"Thing is, none of the statues currently being removed (at least in the US, can't speak for the UK) are of people who helped the country succeed or prosper. They're of traitors who conspired and enacted the greatest mass slaughter of Americans we've seen in our history. They're of slavers who betrayed every oath they've ever known out of sick, greedy desire to own and abuse their fellow man.

So sure, some historical figures are complicated in that they achieved a lot for the nations and also happened to absolutely brutalize others, with a sprinkling of genocide here and there. And, you know what, maybe they get to go in the museum to be properly contextualized.

Otherwise, you're glorifying them. All of them. Every last heroic achievement and horrific atrocity.",ftpghkr,3.5
Canada can’t defend itself if another country like Russia or the US wants to annex it.,"Pretty much what the title says. 

As a longtime resident of Canada, I’m very proud to be a part of a welcoming mosaic society that may have its issues, but overall has an excellent standard of living and is so much more safe and trustworthy than anywhere else I’ve lived. However, as a peacekeeping nation, Canada is very vocal about its opposition to war and playing an aggressive role in it. My more liberal friends strongly dislike the US for its interference in other countries’ affairs, one of them likening it to “swinging their dick around so everyone knows they’re the Head Bitch in Charge” lol

And while I don’t wholly disagree with that view of the U.S., I do see how this influence can keep other countries from wanting to push them around. The same can be said for Russia, who is already out-muscling other nations in a bid for Arctic territory, right up against Canada’s economic zone, making many Canadians nervous about Russian expansion. It’s not like we could really stop them, right? 

The military is quite negatively viewed here (a friend of mine in the military said when he went to do training in Georgia, U.S., people in the airport were very friendly, and when he touched down in Toronto, he got sneers and ambivalence from the public) so gaining public support amongst our relatively small population for a war would be tough. As a very resource rich nation, Canada would be a ripe target should things go south globally. 

Obviously this is all conjecture. Someone change my view. I don’t like feeling this way.

EDIT: my view has been changed! Thanks Reddit, I like feeling protected. Stay safe everyone!",nmkalx,"So the question is multi faceted.  In the short term no.  Canada has a tiny military that could not stand up to large scale conventional forces.  Long term, I would say it depends on the level of local cooperation.

I don't believe rape culture exists in mainstream Western culture.,"**I've marked this NSFW as no doubt there will be people who find this subject intensely upsetting/triggering**

By way of getting to the point of this discussion, I was thinking about the rise of fascism in Europe and the US over the last decade and remembering how, up until very recently, the one thing that *everybody* simply agreed upon, without qualification, was that fascism was bad.
 I think it's beyond question that society's view of fascism has changed from being on a par with child molestation to being something that traditional conservative parties are actively engaging with. Why is this?
 Well, it's not because more people are being born fascist - it's because there are enough voices, in enough places, saying that being a fascist is OK.
 In other words, there's an encouragement to people with fascist tendencies to express those tendencies without fear of overwhelmingly hostile and disgusted response from virtually every quarter of society. 
I believe that there's now, for want of a better term, a 'fascist culture'. Not large. Definitely not the majority. But it exists - which itself was unthinkable even a few short years ago. 

Which brings me (eventually, sorry) to rape culture. 
The reason I don't believe it exists is that I don't see any evidence of, to paraphrase myself, an encouragement to people with rapist tendencies to express those tendencies without fear of an overwhelmingly hostile and disgusted response from virtually every quarter of society. I don't hear the voices saying that being pro-rape is OK, that it's a legitimate position to hold.
In contrast with the rise of neofacism, or the continuing problems of racism and sexism, I don't see any such acceptance of rape; no pro-rape groups; no pro-rape academics or think tanks. None of the cultural paraphernalia that, in my view, constitutes what we usually consider to constitute 'a culture of' something.

I don't know anyone who is pro-rape, I've not heard of any organisation that is - and in fact everyone I'm aware of to opine on the subject has said that it's bad. Now, in the header I qualified this by saying 'in mainstream Western culture'. No doubt there *are* fringe groups I'm unaware of that are pro-rape, as there no doubt  are with pro-paedophilia groups - but none of these (thank god) are even close to being part of what I'd consider mainstream Western culture.

Anyway. Enough from me. Change my view, please.",vgehro,"The issue is that stuff all perpetrators of rape, consider themselves rapists. That’s what’s behind the notion of rape culture, that it’s something that “just happens” but no-one is at fault.

Changing your gender doesn't make sense.,"English is not my native tongue, so I may have some grammatical mistakes (and I'm also a bit redundant with words, sorry) 

I think gender is based on stereotypes, and that's why i think it's wrong and should be abolished. I can sort of imagine why trans people think as they do, because we live in a society where people expect you to act in a specific way based on your condition of man/woman. Gender is a spectrum and it's drew on society, but i don't understand the necessity of it. I think people should be able to think, feel and act as they do without having to assign themselves a gender. For example, why call yourself a woman if  you ~~just~~ like ~~feminine things and other~~ matters involving the feminine gender?, that's kind of unfair to biological women, like, why are you assuming that you are a woman just because you think in a certain way? 

I believe people can behave and dress as they want without having to change their pronouns and start using hormones. I don't like having this transphobic view, but any of the things I've read could change my mind.

Anyway, I think trans people *should* be respected; if a trans woman says she's a woman, then she *is* one, and shall be treated as one (that's why i disagree with radical feminists). I think we should teach people and younger generations that they can do whatever they want without having to choose another gender and change their appearance in order to fit in with the chosen gender.

Edit: I've always wanted to ask this to a trans person and also ask them what made them realise they were transgender, but i never did that because I thought it was probably inappropriate.

Edit 2: Read at least some of my answers to other people before exposing your view, because I've already read many texts claiming i said some things I didn't actually mean to convey..",j8vvuq,"So Im not trans because I think dresses are cute or making a skirt go twirly is fun. Don’t get me wrong twirly skirts are fun. But if that was all it was I could jus tour on a skirt at home.

I want to be a woman because **i want to be a woman**, or as people who believe in gender identity say because I am a woman. So far the best (limited) science confirms this. Also we have evidence of forcefully causing a cis person to transition gives them gender dysphoria. We see this in Reimer (doctor cut off his dick, whoops, might as well make him a girl), Alan Turing (his medical castration is very similar to trans medication), and the USSRs women’s (took testosterone changing their bodies towards masculine). All of them started exhibiting symptoms very similar to gender dysphoria.

So I want to be a woman what does that mean? Well it means a lot of things. I want to dress as a woman, I want to have sex as a woman, I want to be referred to as a woman, etc. Is this just because I find these things attractive. Nope, some of them I absolutely hate but still feel the need to do. Like I hate cooking and cleaning but feel great shame and feel like a failure as a woman because my upbringing in a conservative religious (cult?) community very strongly instilled into me that women should want to do these things and should enjoy them.

Trans people aren’t independent of societal expectations. We didn’t have all of the punishment/reward that come involved with forcing them into people, but we still grew up surrounded by it and internalising it.

Additionally now that I have transitioned I am subject to the punishment/reward parts of the system. In someways to a greater degree than a cis woman. Because the more I deviate from what society dictates a woman must do the more I feel judged, the more I feel imposter syndrome, and the more I am attacked by those that wish to invalidate me. Then if I do conform I’m called out for over compensating etc. It is a loose loose situation.",g8gp6r0,3.3333333333333335
"The heavy focus on the idea of a ""covert racist"" is a waste of time at best, a malicious distraction at worst.","I believe that we're spending too much time trying to figure out which of our politicians are and are not racist. The focus has been taken away from things that politicians have said or done that are outwardly racist (alarming soundbite, blackface in old halloween costumes, things like that) and towards more ethereal sources. Today, a politician can be accused of being racist because of the company he choose to associate with. The idea of ""covert racist"" being pushed around, the implication being that many politicians are racist but work very hard to avoid ""outing"" themselves. 

I'm not here to argue that there is no such thing as a covert racist. In fact, I'm very sure that there is such a thing. What I do want to argue are two points. 

**1) It's unfair to accuse someone of being a covert racist before taking the time to truly try to understand their logic behind supporting a policy.**

There is a growing divide between the left and the right, and I have a very serious concern that the idea of the ""covert racist"" teaches those on the left that they can't possibly understand the logic of someone who supports strong immigration laws or opposes affirmative action, because those policies ""only come from people who are secretly racist"". Now more than ever we need to engage in healthy dialog and seek common ground.

**2) If their policies are good, their intentions simply shouldn't matter.**

If a ""covert racist"" is so good at hiding his racism that his policies are good for minorities, then I really don't care about his personal beliefs. By the same logic, if a well-intentioned politician who cares greatly about minorities creates a policy that hurts them, he's got to go. Intention doesn't matter, results matter. Rather than arguing all day about whether or not a politician is secretly racist, start having a conversation about his policies and what you think of them.

In my experience, it's much more difficult to go against the grain here. I've been accused myself of being a racist just for disagreeing with this new logic. So please, convince me why I should jump on the bandwagon.",cirtzt,If the focus is so heavy why not give us some examples of what you are talking about.,ev8syso,1.5
The idea of billionaires is unethical,"Look, I totally understand that in some cases, money is made through hard work and grit, among opportunity and luck. I applaud and congratulate those who have become millionaires through their own means. 

But billionaires....jesus. At some point, your hard work stops being the cause of your income. At some point, your money comes from the exploitation of others and our planet. I don’t think people fully comprehend the amount of money a billion dollars is. If I earned $1500/hour, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, and I had been working from the moment the Declaration of Independence had been signed, I STILL wouldn’t have a billion dollars. And there are people out there with billions PLURAL??

I just don’t understand how it’s ethical for people to sit on this pile of money that they’ll never reasonably use up and not do good with it. I mean, with that amount of money, you could solve disparities like homelessness, lack of education, and more! And people will say, “oh, they’ve donated $3 million here”, but for someone worth 100 billion, that’s literally .003% of their money.

It just blows my mind how people with this opportunities don’t spend it for the greater good and instead, just keep it to themselves. The Amazon rainforest is burning, and the man who named his company after it hasn’t done a thing. It’s absolutely insane.

EDIT: fixed a typo

EDIT 2: This got....a lot more responses than I was expecting. I’ll try and respond when I have time, but thank you guys for a contentious and eye-opening debate!!

EDIT 3: Wow. There’s a LOT of comments here. This is going to be my last edit because this grew a lot more than I expected. To address a couple points:

• I awarded one delta not because they changed my view, not because I agreed with them, but because they offered a new perspective into the conversation that I had not considered before. Again, it did not change my view, but it did make me stop and reevaluate. 

• Those of you saying that I’m just bitter because I don’t have that money and if I want that money I should work hard—I’m a teen from a fairly middle class background. I’m fine. I’m looking from an outside POV and offering a critique on the people as well as the system. Plus, saying that I should work hard for that money misses the whole point. 

• Yes, billionaires aren’t obligated to do anything, but this isn’t discussing legal obligations. This is looking from a moral standpoint, in which I’m saying they don’t HAVE to, but they SHOULD. 

• Yes, I know that billionaires don’t have billions of dollars of cash. Yes, I know to obtain that, they’d have to liquify their assets. I’m well aware. This is again as much of a critique on the system as it is of the individual person that allowed them to get there. With that type of net worth, people have incredible influence in the world too, both from a monetary aspect and a power aspect. 

• I know the world is a lot more complicated that I made it out to be in a Reddit post. I’m really just trying to get the barebones of my ideas down in words. Thank you for pointing out the nuances and creating meaningful discussions. 

Thanks for the opportunity to discuss this you guys.

Another example, you're about to be hit by a car and in the last second someone pulls you and saves your life, Would you reward this person like he saved your life or like he 'worked' for 1 second/? The value of things come from how useful they are to the people who pay for them. Now, think about Google and the way it changed the world, is it useful? Does it really matter how long it took to build it?",ey211i5,2.0
"Baking recipes should, by default, provide amount of eggs needed by volume (e.g. mls).","Baking, unlike most other cooking, is a fairly precise process. Proportions should be kept very strict if you are to expect good results.  There is no possibility of fixing your mistakes once the mix or dough hits the oven.

For this reason, imprecise directions such as ""add 3 medium eggs"" make no sense. Eggs are not standardized. And what is medium to you may be very different to what is medium to me.  Result?  Messed up baking results and inability to **consistently** implement baking recipes as intended.

For this reason instead (or at least *in additions to*) the number of eggs, volume should also be given, e.g., the recipe should say:

1. Add 120 ml of eggs (approximately 3 medium eggs).

Also. If egg white and egg yolks are needed in different proportions, you can list separate measurements for those.

Anticipated objections:

A. It's too difficult 

Not really break the eggs, mix them, them measure like any other liquid that you have to measure anyway. 

Also. If BOTH volume and amount of eggs are listed you can still follow the old way, if you are OK with subpar results.

B. It's wasteful

Not really. We already accept recipes that call for ""5 yolks"" and we are not worried too much about what happens to the 5 whites.  Also, you can easily make an omlett with left over egg (just add some salt/pepper) and fry to create a nice mid-baking snack.

So what am I missing? Why are not egg measurements in volume more common/standard?

EDIT:

""Baking recipes should, by default, provide amount of eggs needed by weights (e.g. grams)""",s0lwc8,"Medium is somewhat standardised. When you buy eggs at the store you can buy large and medium and small. It says on the packages.

Access to abortion should not be justified using religious freedom claims,"Recently, I've seen several posts and articles about different religious groups arguing that abortion bans infringe on their religious freedoms. For example, the [Satanaic temple](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/u0mpfu/yeah_im_gonna_need_an_update_on_this/) and [Jewish groups](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article262496912.html) among others. I consider myself to be pro-choice, but I don't think these lawsuits have merit. Religious freedom is not a get out of jail free card. We do not allow homicide, human sacrifice, rape, or under-age marriage (although depending on the state and age there may be some debate on this last one) to be justified on religious freedom grounds. The same should go for abortion. You should not be allowed to get an abortion simply because it is a part of your religious practice. Instead, access to abortion should be dictated by a general consensus of society. I'm not a legal expert and this is just my layman's understanding of the situation so if there are some legal technicalities that I'm missing or differentiate abortion from my examples I'd be interested to hear them.

Strawberries and apples always taste worse when cooked versus fresh,"Over the years I have tried various ways to change strawberries and apples when cooking/baking and have found these fruits to be most enjoyable when they are fresh. From making pies to jams and dehydration,  nothing has come close to the delicious flavor of fresh strawberries and apples. I find that the changes in texture are generally worse in every way compared to their fresh counterparts. the mushiness that is more akin to baby food does not make me salivate like a crisp apple or a fresh strawberry with whipped cream. 
When cooked, the browning of the sugars in these fruits does not result in the usual deliciousness that I associate with caramelized things. To me it just always tastes not as good as fresh, though I love caramelization and almost every other way and form.

Democracy is a failure as a concept,"1. Democracy gives each citizen (usually of a certain age, the other restrictions tend to have phased out) the right to vote. 

2. Each vote is equal in value.

I don’t ask my doctor for legal advice, he is a doctor. I don’t ask my lawyer for medical advice, he is a lawyer. I don’t ask my lawn care providers where I should invest my money, they are not financial advisors.

Technological progress enables social and moral progress,"In the last 2 centuries, we went from rural towns to large industrialized cities. This rapid progress saw more change than humans have gone through in thousands of years, which can be attributed to changes in how we obtain knowledge via the scientific method. These developments ushered in an era of peace and prosperity, as well as anxiety. In addition, we have also gone through numerous social and even moral developments such as the abolition of child labor, the civil rights movement, women's suffrage, as well as reduction in crime, poverty, and infant mortality.

This begs the question, are these two things connected or simply correlated?

My view is that scientific and technological progress is required for social and moral progress to occur.

One potent example where this seems to be true is the abolition of slavery. When adjusted for inflation, the cost of a slave in 1865 was about $23,000. A modern tractor can cost between $22,000 and $50,000, but it can also do much more work than a slave can. So, even if slavery were legal today it would not be as economical as using a tractor with a paid laborer. This suggests that the existence of tractors and other machines makes slave labor less economical than paid labor.

More recently, women's suffrage and even the LGBTQ movement are enabled by technology. A society that is underdeveloped doesn't have access to medical advancements, and this means that this society is dependent on large families in order to maintain a constant or slow population growth. The easiest way to do this, is to make women into home makers who's only purpose is to have and raise a family, and force homosexuals into traditional marriages. Therefore, medical advancements means that families can raise fewer healthier kids meaning that women and LGBTQ persons can be liberated.

A final example, would be the development of synthetic meats. Factory farms force animals to suffer in atrocious conditions, which vegans and vegetarians argue is immoral. Synthetic meats can replace animal suffering without the need to sacrifice the taste of meat that we enjoy, so I would suggest this too can provide a route for moral progress dependent on technology.

TL;DR: Technology allows us to make moral decisions by giving us alternative actions, therefore technological development is imperative for social and moral development.

edit: ""negative"" aspects of technology that enable greater immorality are irrelevant to the point I am making here. The fact that atomic weapons can be built doesn't mean that there is no way that we can use atomic energy for moral applications, but if we don't know how to do this then we can't get the benefits. Every rose has its thorns after all.",ky7nm3,"You are making a lot of assumptions here

   1. Why on earth is anything ""evil"" or ""good"" in the first place, why is murder evil, why is outlawing gay marriage immoral. There is no single agreed upon moral code for everyone to live by, IE morality is relative. If morality is relative, then morality is irrelevant.

Liberals need to divest themselves from the assumption that men and women are innately psychologically the same.,"To start with, there is a lot of research that suggests that men and women have biological dissimilarities in their psychologies (here is a great review of the issue by experts in the field: [https://heterodoxacademy.org/the-most-authoritative-review-paper-on-gender-differences/](https://heterodoxacademy.org/the-most-authoritative-review-paper-on-gender-differences/)) .  I don't think many psychologists that study the matter would say that there are NO innate differences. The debate seems to be about how big those differences are, and how much they actually influence real world phenomena (like the gender disparity in STEM fields for example).

I here don't take any strong position on that debate. That is a scientific debate better left to the scientists. Here I am simply making the claim that liberals also SHOULD NOT take such a hard position on that debate.

It seems like many people on the left are absolutely committed to men and women having the same psychology.

This comes out very clearly when we try to explain why there isn't a 50/50 split in some areas of life. Women are under-represented in tech (for example). To many people, the simple fact  of difference in representation, ***implies*** discrimination.  But there is only an implication here if we  assume that women and men  are equally interested and qualified for those jobs (basically the assumption that men and women have the same psychology relevant to tech work).

I see it this way. Leftists want people to be treated fairly. And they see stereotypes about women as excuses to discriminate against them. The stereotype ""Women are very emotional"" can very often lead to not considering women for jobs where you can't let emotion get in your way. That's clearly a problem. But liberals have over-corrected. They try to say that in fact there are NO biological differences between men and women (that matter at least). And in fact, to even imply that men and women are naturally different, is seen as either (at best) dangerous, or (at worst) evil. They seem to think that to be able to treat each other fairly, we MUST believe men and women are essentially the same.

That is very dangerous. The left should not have a dubious scientific claim underpinning their morality. Because if the science comes out against this assumption, they have to either deny the science (which sucks), or their argument completely fails.

The other danger is that assuming the difference in biology between men and women DOES actually affect the real world (which certainly seems at least possible based on the research done), trying to force a 50/50 split in everything would require unjust over corrections.

And the thing is, it is perfectly consistent to both fight for equal treatment of men and women, while acknowledging that there may be differences in their psychology. It may be trickier practically, but it is quite consistent.

So, in numbered argument form:

Claim1:Men and women have essentially the same psychology, and that any differences that exist are either very small, or masked by environmental factors and thus don't really matter

1. Many liberals believe that (Claim1).
2. (Claim1) could very well turn out to be factually false. There is still some scientific debate.
3. Liberals don't need to believe (Claim1) to get what they want in terms of discrimination and fairness.
4. It hurts Liberals to have a dubious scientific claim as a foundation for their arguments

Therefore:Liberals shouldn't build their arguments on top of (Claim1)

"the various public health departments lost all credibility when they said that it was safe to take part in the BLM protest, but not the anti-lockdown protests","Before I start, I want to say that I do support the BLM protests, and to some extent I even support the rioting (they're burning the wrong stuff down, but that's a whole other thing).  I also think the anti-lockdown protests are dumb.

The American work week should be shortened,"I recently saw something about a proposed 32 hour work week.  

I work as an engineer and after about 6 months in the field realized that a lot of the updates to software I use daily make me able to do 10 fold the output that someone in my role could do 10-15 years ago, and exponentially more than when modeling software was in its early stages.  

(This has been a blessing as my bosses have been older, not as familiar with how to use said software effectively, are are amazed at output)

In other words I could find solutions (my role’s output essentially) to as many problems as someone with my role in ~2005 could do in 40 hours in less than 5.  

I know that across all kinda of industries this is true to varying degrees

* my sister is a baker and ovens don’t improve as quickly as the modeling software so her role’s output/hour hasn’t changed nearly as dramatically.

* my mom works in retail at a big box store.  Self-checkout and online ordering have made companies able to generate more revenue per employee but not as drastically as my case.  

* my brother is studying to be a nurse.  Improvements in care and medicine mean better care delivered per nurse but still as many “nurse hours” are likely needed per day to staff a city hospital.  

What would it look like if we started to taper down the length of the socially acceptable work week?  I would expect a clear reduction in overall economic output and technological advancement but not correlated perfectly linearly with the % of work week reduction.   Buildings would take longer to build.  The cures for various diseases would be discovered a little later.  The next iphone or car model will have a little less new features.  But will it be very costly to our standard of living?

Also for people holding 401k and other investments: would the average growth rate decrease substantially?

I think the tradeoff of decreased economic output would be outweighed by the improved quality of life.

US federal taxes should be adjusted for local variation in the cost of living.,"The US is a large and varied country, meaning that a solidly middle class income in one area would place a similar family in another area in poverty.  To achieve the same standard of living as a family living in McAllen, TX on $30,000, a family living in Austin, TX needs to make $40,119.  A family living in San Francisco, CA would need to make $79,405 (see calculator [here](https://money.cnn.com/calculator/pf/cost-of-living/index.html)).

The federal tax code, however, ignores all of this.  Even though someone in McAllen making $30k and someone in SF making $79k actually have the same standard of living, the person in SF is treated as much richer for tax purposes and will end up paying substantially higher federal taxes. Assuming a single person with no dependents, the tax filer in McAllen pays $4,237 in **federal** taxes (14.12%) whereas the tax filer in San Francisco pays $16,599 in **federal** taxes (20.9%).  I'm just talking federal taxes here and leaving aside state taxes.

Simply put, there is no reason that someone should pay a higher tax rate just because they happen to live in a high cost of living area.

"Using Ur-Fascism by Umberto Eco as a guideline, the GOP is a fascist party.","I'll start this with a link to a PDF of [Ur-Fascism](https://sites.evergreen.edu/politicalshakespeares/wp-content/uploads/sites/226/2015/12/Eco-urfascism.pdf). 

**1.** Cult of Tradition

This is probably the most abstract of Eco's points. It's not just tradition in the sense of older values, but also a combination of various values into a syncretic, but also contradictory ideology. Like how many conservatives consider the US to founded on ""Judeo-Christian Values"" while ignoring anything from the founding fathers that goes against that. Or using religion to justify conservatism on every stance but ignoring any part of their own religion that goes against them (which I'll expand on for point 4).

**2.** Rejection of Modernism

We see the GOP reject modernism constantly. The whole ""back in my day"" line may be somewhat of a joke nowadays, but there is a serious contingent of people in America that genuinely think modern advances have made the world a worse place. Whether this be rejection of technological advances like automation, the internet, and cell phones, or advances in modern ideology and thinking, most of which is highly secular. 

**3.** Action For Action's Sake

I'll let Mr. Eco's words here prove most of my point:

&gt;Action being beautiful in
itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of
emasculation. Therefore culture is suspect insofar as it is identified with critical attitudes.
Distrust of the intellectual world has always been a symptom of Ur-Fascism, from Goering’s
alleged statement (“When I hear talk of culture I reach for my gun”) to the frequent use of such
expressions as “degenerate intellectuals,” “eggheads,” “effete snobs,” “universities are a nest of
reds.” 

I don't think I need to delve too deeply into the GOP's rejection of higher education and intellectuals. How often do we hear that college is a ""breeding ground for leftists/socialists/liberals/atheists""?

**4.** Religious Opposition to Critical Analysis

&gt;No syncretistic faith can withstand analytical criticism. The critical spirit makes distinctions,
and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises
disagreement as a way to improve knowledge. For Ur-Fascism, disagreement is treason.

There is a very common thing among many religious conservative groups, evangelicals in particular. Anyone who has read the Bible should be able to tell that Jesus was not a very conservative figure. In fact many biblical figures espouse various ""liberal"" ideas. Especially on immigration and the poor/wealthy.

**Exodus 22:21** – Moses gives God’s law:  “You shall not wrong or oppress a resident alien; for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.”

 **Leviticus 19:33-34 and 24:22** – When the alien resides with you in your land, you shall not oppress the alien.  The alien who resides with you shall be to you as the citizen among you; you shall love the alien as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt:  I am the Lord your God.”

**Deuteronomy 24:14   –** “You shall not withhold the wages of poor and needy laborers, whether other Israelites or aliens who reside in your land...”

**Luke 16:13** No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.

**Proverbs 28:20** A faithful man will abound with blessings, but whoever hastens to be rich will not go unpunished.

**Mark 10:25** ""Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.""

If you use any of these bible verses, or any others which oppose conservative thinking, it will by and large be met with immediate rejection. This is because the kind of faith held by so many conservative Christians is an immutable kind of faith. These kind of people hold that their beliefs are the true beliefs of the Bible and therefore the mere act of questioning these beliefs is tantamount to betraying God.

**5.** Fear of Difference

We see this most clearly today with the vilification of immigrants, previously with muslims after 9/11, and always African Americans. I mean, how often has Trump literally used the words ""invaders"" to describe the people migrating towards the US. No one in America would stand for the way immigrant children are being treated if it was happening to citizens, or even probably just white immigrants. But the hispanic immigrant has become an ""other"" to the modern GOP. 

**6.** Appeal To Economic Anxiety

&gt;Ur-Fascism derives from individual or social frustration. That is why one of the most typical
features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering
from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of
lower social groups. In our time, when the old “proletarians” are becoming petty bourgeois (and
the lumpen are largely excluded from the political scene), the fascism of tomorrow will find its
audience in this new majority

Again I think Eco himself shows the link and I don't think I need to go too deep describing how the GOP uses the ""others"" to stir fear among working class people. Industrial and mining jobs are drying up and white people are set to lose their status as a majority within the US over the next few decades. Perfect time to exploit fear. The white hegemony on American politics is dying, and to a privileged class that feels like oppression.

**7.** Obsession With A Plot

Globalism/Deep State. Seems obvious enough

**8.** Enemies Who Are Simultaneously Overwhelmingly Strong and Pathetically Weak

This type of thinking was most obviously seen in how Nazi Germany viewed Jewish people. Now we see it with SJW's or liberals in general. On one hand, the average ""liberal SJW"" is ripping up the social fabric of America and actively undermining the government. At the same time, the average ""liberal SJW"" is a weak willed pushover who cries whenever someone disagrees with them and can never leave their parent's home because they can't handle reality.

**9.** Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy because life is permanent warfare.

It was conservatives who invaded Afghanistan and Iraq (twice). Yes there were some liberals who got wrapped up during the initial zealousness after 9/11, but it has always been conservatives who have the most ""troop worship"". The simple act of saying we should decrease military spending is often related to somehow betraying ""the troops"". And this isn't just warfare in the sense of invading another nation, like it seems Trump and Bolton want to do with Iran. Conservatives have led several domestic ""wars"" too, Drugs, terrorism, and now I would say immigration. I mean we know how disastrous the War On Drugs Was, but almost every conservative will still defend it and take a ""hard on crime"" approach. Fascism requires a constant enemy, and the GOP has always had an enemy to be found.

**10.** Contempt For The Weak

How often do we see rhetoric blaming poor people for their own misfortune from the right? ""Pull yourself up by your bootstrap"" kind of thinking has infested modern US conservatism. If you are poor in America, it is your own fault most Republicans say. Eco also had another point along with this:

&gt; Every citizen belongs to the best people of the
world, the members of the party are the best among the citizens, every citizen can (or ought to)

American exceptionalism, literally this except the party part, is also a huge part of conservative thinking.

**11.** Everybody Is A Hero

This again ties most clearly into military/troop worship. But there is also no shortage of it domestically too. How many right-wing anti-government militias, or just average joes, are there that purport themselves to be the guardians of freedom and liberty? This point also has to do with glorification of death. How often do you hear stuff like ""The government can take my guns from my cold dead hands""? It's not just about their guns, but about heroically dying against a government they view as oppressive.

**12.** Machismo

Eco's words here are pretty self-explanatory with how they relate to the GOP.

&gt;  Since both permanent war and heroism are difficult games to play, the Ur-Fascist transfers
his will to power to sexual matters. This is the origin of machismo (which implies both disdain
for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to
homosexuality). Since even sex is a difficult game to play, the Ur-Fascist hero tends to play with
weapons—doing so becomes an ersatz phallic exercise

**13.** Selective Populism

For a fascist, people are not considered individuals within the realm of politics and government, but rather a single entity for whom the leader (in our case Trump) acts as their interpreter. Now obviously the people are not a single entity because there are various views on every topic, but fascism demands order and similarity, and as Eco wrote earlier disagreement is diversity, and diversity is the enemy. So the leader can choose a group of people who become ""The People"" and all others are then exactly that, ""others"". And we already know how fascists view ""others"".

**14.** Newspeak

The simplification or changing of language to simplify an issue as to reduce critical thinking. Rather than debating the merits of the ACA, you can simply say ""death panel"". Rather than talk about if and how earth should be inherited you can simply say ""death tax"".

I will happily accept arguments debating how I relate the GOP to these points, the validity of Ur-Fascism itself, or any other angle I have overlooked. I can also talk more on any of these points, I just didn't want the post to be a huge block of text.",c7ij48,"I feel like ""modernism"" refers not to ""modernity"" but rather the actual modernist movement of the post-Great War period. the PDF says:

&gt; The rejection of the modern world was disguised as a rebuttal of the capitalistic way of life, but it mainly concerned the rejection of the Spirit of 1789 (and of 1776, of course).

this means that fascism is rejecting the principles of both the French and American Revolutions -- the Spirit of 1789 referring to La Fayette's Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen. In other words, does the mandate to rule come from above, as in a totalitarian monarchy with a divine right? Or from below, with the popular will giving the ruler an accord with which to rule. WWI was seen by the modernists as the culmination of the failure of the feudalist, monarchical system. It has nothing to do with ""back in my day"" nostalgia.",esfduea,3.5
8 hours 5 days a week isn't worth it.,"I've done long days of work. 10/12 hours. It's ok for me because I don't do them consecutively (Wedding videography). I recently trained for a job and was doing 8 hour days each day in training. I left because it made me feel terrible. I don't see how anyone does it or why it's the norm. I would MUCH rather work 20 hours a week and be poor than work 40 and be less poor. I understand the economy is such that working 40 and still being poor is often the case. In my view this is crazy. We are creating so many negative externalities (depression, anxiety, lack of time with children, deaths of dispair, &amp;c.) It's been shown than people aren't efficient for that long each day anyway. Obviously some things take that much time in a day, but then we should work that job 3 days a week instead of 5. Such as airline pilots, trucker, anything that really requires a full 8 hours or more in one day. I think this whole working 8 hours a day thing is killing us. It's one thing when it was mostly men doing it, but now each family has 2 people who are never at home, which means families have to pay for childcare and come home exhausted and unable to clean or cook. I don't feel that these hours are really connected to value in many cases. Wages are determined by the lowest value people will accept, not the value created. So when women entered the workforce all of our labour just became cheaper because families can accept lower paying work and get by. It's not worth it. For individuals or society. I read bullshit jobs by the late David Graeber, which reinforced a lot of what I thought about work. Much of it is simply done because we socially think we need to, not because it creates anything. We could all work an average of 3 hours a day and do and create more than we do now.",lp3qx9,"Was it worth it for early humans, before civilisation, to work at surviving every waking hour?

I think my 'diversity backlash' around the new Lord of the Rings is less about skin color and more about seeing modern politics get injected into a fantasy story.,"There is a lot of this going around- 'Imagine being upset about a black elf in a series where the trees talk and wizards ride on eagles'.

But wouldn't they expect fans to be upset if characters used iphones or had tramp stamp tattoos?

They have talking trees, why can't a character have a Pepsi bottle?

I think ""Bright"" was a better way to do a modern fantasy story- You can use Tolkien's ideas but if you need to include a multiethnic cast, set it in a time where globalism makes sense.

Why not just make an African fantasy story or Asian stories, etc?

Obviously the problem is that Amazon needs the name recognition of an existing property but wants a modern young demographic to watch it. So they have to make a weird hybrid that ends up causing fights because everyone is there for a different reason.

To me, part of the essence of a Tolkien story is that it's provincial and glorifying an idealized rural England free of modern encroachment. If that is something we shouldn't see because it diminishes our current social ideas, then they shouldn't make a movie about it.

"Colonizing Mars is a terrible way to prevent human extinction, in case Earth becomes inhospitable in the future","There simply isn't a conceivable scenario where Earth could be rendered more hostile to life than Mars currently is. Even if the asteroid which wiped out the dinosaurs hit Earth tomorrow, after the dust settles in a few years, Earth will still be significantly easier to live on than Mars. We could mine every atom of uranium in the Earth's crust, construct as many nuclear warheads as we can, nuke each other into sludge, and Earth would still be more habitable than Mars. 

Sending people and materiel to Mars is extremely costly, if some eccentric billionaire really wants to save humanity from the apocalypse, it would be far more cost-effective to construct doomsday bunkers, dome cities or terraforming equipment here on Earth, that way money isn't wasted blasting these things into space. Or even better, invest all resources into protecting the environment. After all, it's far more likely that humanity will be destroyed by climate change than some zombie virus or an asteroid the size of Texas.",csmyeg,"I don’t disagree with your opinion the matter. Mars is definitely not a backup planet for Earth, but I do disagree with your assumption that that is why we are and should be making efforts to establish a colony.

People like Bill Maher are always saying shit like that, as if Mars exploration is for billionaires to flee to after they destroy the planet and it’s nonsense. Nobody except people who know nothing about it think of it in those terms.

What it would be is a valuable outpost for scientific advancement and ultimately for our eventual advancement as a species into colonizing our solar system. Again, more for the sake of knowledge than anything else.

We aren’t alleviating population issues, or maintaining these colonies without massive logistical support from earth any time soon. So the often heard argument is ‘we should fix the problems on earth before wasting money on things like this’.

The budgets involved are only a small fraction of expenditure though, especially with things like the European Space Agency where costs can be split across multiple economies, and this can include joint missions with NASA.

We don’t know where scientific discoveries will take us, we just increase knowledge and understanding and that naturally leads to a return on investment later in most cases. The moon race for example was a net economic benefit when the tech that came out of it is factored in.

The idea that we will ever ‘fix all the problems’ here first is a ridiculous one. There will always be problems here, and yet people attack space exploration for its relatively small costs compared to the US defense budget for example which is orders of magnitude higher and exists largely as a jobs program and not a necessity, even according to pentagon estimates.

Non-binary folks are trans,"""Trans"" means that your gender identity does not correspond to your assigned-sex-at-birth. The two assigned sexes are female and male, and the genders that correspond to them are ""woman"" and ""man."" Non-binary folks are neither women nor men; whatever gender they are, it does not correspond to that associated with their assigned-sex-at-birth. They are ""trans"" in precisely the same way that trans men and trans women are.

Some folks think that what makes someone ""trans"" is that they've transitioned. That's certainly one understanding of how ""trans"" works as a prefix, but it's not the only one. ""Trans"" also denotes the process of transitioning itself, without having any particular end goal in sight. Thus, ""transportation infrastructure,"" ""transit,"" ""transversal.""

Non-binary folks are ""trans"" but they're not transitioning towards anything that's available at the moment, that is, either of the two binary genders: rather, like transportation infrastructure, they occupy the continuous space between two points (man, woman) without being either.

Edit: some folks are insisting that ""trans"" means ""opposite,"" or, in any case, that whatever trans does mean, it includes the notion of being opposite  something. There are logically distinct forms of opposition though. *Contradictories* are two opposites where one cannot be true without the other being false: ""mortal"" and ""immortal"" are contradictories; everything will be one or the other.  In contrast, two *contraries* can both be false: for example, ""small"" and ""big"" are contraries, in that some things are neither (e.g., gases, since they expand to fill a container). I take ""opposite"" for ""trans"" to mean contrary: this means that not everything need be a man or woman, in much the same way that not everything need be big or small.

&amp;#x200B;",ub88rm,"this is an unchangeable view unless you provide a context from which it can be changed. as it stands, your definition is categorically wrong to non-binary people who do not consider themselves trans, but can still be right to you (though you would be invalidating their identity). this is the issue with arguing about prescriptivist semantics and, more broadly, linguistics - it doesn't reflect the way the terms are practically used, and can fail to account for the fact that a term can have multiple meanings that depend on the context in which they are used.

this kind of issue isn't one of semantics relating to the definition of universal terms, but rather one of semantics relative to personal identity. the simple, non-prescriptivist reality of these terms is that they mean different things to different people, and will likely continue to for quite a while as our culture (too) slowly adjusts to accommodate them.

i certainly agree that non-binary trans people are trans. it's just that non-binary people who aren't, aren't. no matter how much ideation you do on what the ideal definitions of these terms may be, the reality is that invalidating those people's identity is a necessary step in arguing ""what their identity really is"" - in this case, that they are trans if they are non-binary, and cannot be non-binary if they are not trans",i63vigd,3.0

"US school districts should stop doing standardized tests, even without larger legislation","K-12 Schools should simply stop performing standardized testing when able, even at the loss of funding from their state. At the state level, school boards and local/municipal districts/school boards, or whatever they might be called, might not be able to make this decision at all, but when possible would be better to ignore standardized testing even at the cost of funding.

**Federal funding** \- I had been operating under the assumption that non-compliance with standardized testing would lead to a reduction in federal funding, but this might not actually be the case. Given reasonable complaints about standardized testing and federal overreach on education, if they are unable to do anything or much to punish a school for non-compliance, then this is irrelevant.

**State funding** \- Many school districts might find that states would be willing to grant waivers in cases where a district decides not to perform them. Furthermore, from my personal experience in the classroom, very large amounts of class time were literally wasted trying to get underperforming students to a passing level.

So, if budgets would have to be cut, it might not actually lead to lower performance due to inherent weaknesses of teaching to standardized testing. For example, a school might reduce the absolute amount of class time while still having an equivalent amount of actual instruction.

**Compensation from budget shortfalls -** Remaining school time could be handled with lower paid tutors or childcare professionals, or made up with private instruction for students whose parents could afford it. This might even create opportunities for a district to make up funds by renting out classrooms to private instructors, or by reducing the absolute amount of class time, give extra instruction to students who need extra help and allow high-performing students more independent study.

My first thought as to how to change my view would be to show that, from a cost/benefit perspective, this doesn't add up generally.

**Edit:** Through this discussion, I've realized standardized testing isn't likely the cause of the largest issues, and that schools could already do many of things that would be better already, but don't, and even if standardized tests aren't very useful, the alternatives are so implausible that they could very well be *poor* but also the *best.*",nxkn2n,"I guess I don't understand what is wrong with standardized tests.

Democrats and Republicans live in completely different realities and it is destroying our country.,"I would guess that a typical Democrat gets their news from CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, NYT, etc. And the average conservative gets his news from Fox News, Talk Radio, OAN, Breitbart, The Daily Caller, YouTubers like Stephen Crowder and Ben Shapiro, etc. If you go more into the fringes of the right they probably get their news from QAnon and other conspiracy Facebook groups.

This disparity in where both sides of the political aisle gets their news from is what I believe is causing the massive division and polarization we see. We can't agree on basic facts of reality like whether the 2020 election was fair.

I think one clear measure we can take is enforcing anti-trust laws on broadcast and media companies. The fact that the conservative leaning Sinclair Broadcast Group covers 40% of American households, disproportionately in rural areas, is what is leading to the [brainwashing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fHfgU8oMSo&amp;ab_channel=Deadspin) of these rural conservatives.

Another thing we can do is stop with this ""both sides"" meme. Both sides aren't just as bad when it comes to sensational media and disinformation. There is no left equivalent in terms of disinformation to QAnon. Like, we literally have QAnon supporters as congress people (i.e. Marjorie Taylor Greene). MSNBC or CNN never engaged in sensationalism on the level of the [birther movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories) that Fox News engaged in. Sure, MSNBC, CNN, Washington Post do attack Trump a lot, but they do it on issues that Trump should be attacked on. In contrast, remember when Fox News had a whole media cycle dedicated to [Obama ordering a burger with Dijon mustard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-WnoZbjdh4&amp;ab_channel=TheDailyShowwithTrevorNoah)?

At the end of the day, I think it's safe to say that most Americans want less division, less polarization, some agreement and compromise so we can get things done (fixing poverty, homelessness, drug addiction, healthcare reform, immigration reform, etc.). But we can't accomplish any of that if we don't fix the vast disparity in our media and news consumption.",kyjzxi,"&gt; Another thing we can do is stop with this “both sides” meme.

DC statehood is an objectively bad idea.,"Attempting to make the District of Columbia a state is ignorant of both the constitution and how the the federal government operates. The District of Columbia is not a state for a reason. During the making of the constitution it was obvious the District of Columbia had to be a territory rather than a state. The District of Columbia is a city, nowhere near the size of a state and would have one of the lowest state populations. There seems to be the misconception that the District of Columbia doesn't have the right to vote, this is false. The 23rd amendment allows the District of Columbia to participate in presidential elections.

If the District of Columbia becomes a state they will have to elect a governor and have a state government. A state government would give a state complete control over the District of Colombia which has a 90% democratic population. The District of Columbia would always elect a democratic governor which would give democrats more control over the District of Columbia.

" the International Development sector needs a serious, major change in direction, and should not be supported until it does so.","https://www.vice.com/en_au/partners/stan/inside-the-multi-billion-dollar-world-of-disaster-capitalism?fbclid=IwAR10LHS4jr6yG7Hd00az1qMRyKRmcLoVexZ-7g8SDI_8ZGNGFQGXqtsNKZw

The link above describes a trend in the International Development world that favours the privatisation and corporatisation of solutions to problems. This approach is something I was exposed to during my time working in development, and for the lay reader it is the best way to know what I mean about why it is I can’t support development as it stands. 

Bringing it back to me and my experiences, I worked focussing on education in Indonesia. Generally I thought that there was always going to be an unappeasable marxist critic who would find fault in anything, and such reflexive criticism should be ignored. Those who can, do; those who can’t, criticise. That sort of thing. 

That changed after I was sent on a project to build up capacity in a school for indigenous children. I quickly found out that the school was a front for this sort of cult, who were trying to “rationalise” these indigenous people out of their ways. This cult had some really problematic views of their own, and some questionable commercial interests in the area. The agency that sent me on this project were broadly aware of this but didn’t ask too deeply; as long as theres a few nice photo ops and some happy donors, nobody gave a toss if we did more harm than good. 

This story, and that link, are extreme examples but basically very little Development is getting done. Nobody believes in it anymore. Every consultant and working group and committee turn lean, mean and exciting projects into bloated three legged donkeys. 

And yes, amongst small donors there are exceptions, but I cannot support anything that has been touched by the US State Department, DFID, DFAT and the major donors of the Development sector. *TLDR; Basically the sector needs to become far more critical of power, money, neutrality, and yes maybe even capitalism than it is now.*

WHAT WILL MORE LIKELY CHANGE MY VIEW is showing me when major players act in a way that isn’t cartel like, doesnt misidentifies problems and barriers to development, or act in a way that isn’t hypocritical. WHAT PROBABLY WONT CHANGE MY VIEW (but go ahead and try if you must) is some variant of “don’t give money to dumb brown people whatsoever” or “I don’t care and neither should you”.",eec7xz,"It seems like there's just a disconnect between money sources and on-field implementation. That the agency you were working for wasn't asking questions is a problem, but that's the weak link NOT privatization.

What your article goes to show is that we've done a bad job of bringing the third part of the political economy triad--capital--to work in these markets. Rather, you either get a single cycle of goods or it simply doesn't ever enter the economy. Say what you will about China's infrastructure development, it has been focused on building critical infrastructure that will materially improve the lives of those in the countries (even though their funding strategies are worse than the WB/IMF/etc).

So, we do need to reevaluate our strategy in international development. But abandoning the traditional funding sources (or, as another commentator said, simply handing money over) does not generate material gains as much as bringing in private capital to support large-scale infrastructure projects. Lagos would be a great candidate for the Carlyle Group to come in and invest in expanding public transit (in return for a large capital state and a guaranteed income). Kinshasa's water, likewise, would be a great place for Bain Capital to marshal its resources to genuinely help people and generate profits. These could be secured and supported by the State Department.

So, if anything I think more privatization is the game, not less. Right now the profit motive sits outside of these countries because the structure is a failure. But by rethinking our structures to be more like China's (with PE funds replacing state financing), development genuinely can become a great force binding people together and improving lives worldwide.

I dont believe illegal immigration has a net benefit that outweighs the risks/costs. I'm especially curious as to why the US is the only country focused on while the countries being immigrated from are not discussed.,"Edit: i've been responding for about 3 hours now. I'm getting food. I have way too many notifications so if you're reading this, i'm probably not going to respond since it's either in the thread or i'm just burnt out.

Thanks everyone, i'll respond when I can. The history buffs here have been the most convincing.

As a naturalized citizen (adopted from central america) to a family that all consist of legalized immigrants (europea and central america) I'm proud of my family for their sacrifices in following the proper channels to obtain citizenship. I myself am grateful to be a citizen of the US. The adoption process is expensive, tedious, background checking intensive and emotionally challenging for all involved.
 Many arguments I hear usually center on humanitarian and empathetic talking points. I can't relate to them because the methods of illegal immigration are dangerous, usually involve paying off protection money to gangs/cartels/coyotes, and often require families to go into debt or borrow money from other poor family members. This includes the feeling of being ""cut in line"" by those who would rather ignore the legal process because of desperation. The worst point (I feel) is that desperate people often have no long term plans or ideas of what to do even if they do make cross into the US. It's a nation whose language they don't speak, money they don't have, laws they don't understand, and discrimination. All of this is a choice by grown afults who made those decisions and should accept the consequences.
Even assuming everyone is a ""desperate but kind hearted person"" what happens to the countries being left? There are many ideas of how the US benefits from illegal immigration. How does Mexico benefit? If every good person leaves Honduras because of the cartels, who is left to improve the nation? If families are borrowing money to pay the cartels protection money, doesn't that fund their influence and ability to corrupt governments? The mexican army recently lost a firefight to gang members. How does illegal immigration benefit the countries left behind?",ee406u,"I have trouble seeing any benefit to our country from deporting someone (especially a head of household) that has lived here peacefully with no crimes on their record while living here for decades.

A Weighted Voting System is better than current democratic voting system,"**What is a Weighted Voting System (WVS)?**

A WVS is a way to ensure that topics to be voted upon are identified via a previously agreed upon mechanism, individuals or group of people are identified according to those topics and the voting results measured via a standardized scale associated to the individuals or group. The system can be as sophisticated, or simple as everyone deems it necessary. Here are two loose examples of a WVS:

* **Example 1:** Farming is a topic and taxation on exported goods through farming is a sub-topic. Farmers and organizations based on exporting farming goods are two stakeholders most closely related to the topic and sub topic. When it comes to matters related to the topic and sub topic (e.g. Export tariffs on a certain country) in a common election, Farmers' vote gets a weight: 5, the organizations' votes get a weight: 3 and everyone else gets 1.
* **Example 2:** Technology is a topic and semiconductor market is a sub-topic. People who works directly in a technology related technical role (let's call them SK1) and companies that operate in the semiconductor industry (let's call them SK2) are the stakeholders identified for this topic and sub topic. SK1's votes get a weight: 3, SK2's votes get a weight: 5 and everyone else's vote gets weight: 1.

**Reasoning:**

A democracy is a great governance system with well documented pros and cons. However, one thing I notice with democracy is that it doesn't fully represent the voices of subject matter experts. In a democratic election (not necessarily country-wide, but mostly around grass-root, county or state-level elections), everyone's vote equals 1. Therefore, the potential of an expert's impact in guiding that field's decision making has probability of easily getting overturned by another uninformed person. In an ideal world, everyone is expected to be an ""informed voter"". However, since that is not the case, industries face the potential of receiving negative rules, policies and consequences based on the votes of an uninformed majority.

What WVS does is identifies topics, key stakeholders related to those topics and assigns standardized weighting scale to the votes of these stakeholders according to their subject matter expertise relevant to the topics. This ensures that the voice of experts are prioritized and their relevant topics are governed by policies that reflect expert opinions.

**Issues with WVS:**

* **Overlapping interests:** There can be topics that are mutually exclusive, yet have the potential to impact one another. For example, The farming topic introduced in Example 1 and ""Foreign Policy"" are two separate and almost mutually exclusive topic. However, in order to implement sanction on one country (foreign policy), the potential for losing agricultural revenue (farming) significantly increases. Experts from both end will be voting for their topics' best interest and one party has the potential to cause significant harm on another.
   * **Counter Argument:** When something like this happens, often the deciding factor becomes number of population. When volume is the tie-breaker, the current general voting method (all votes equal 1) kicks in. One party becomes unhappy, but that's the case with any mutually exclusive overlapping interest situations, but with WVS, the process becomes much more streamlined and filtered.
* **Potential for bias:** Experts will always have an inherent bias for their own topic. The line between right and wrong often starts to get blurry and grey areas increase when you look at a topic in much greater depth. In cases like this, the bias for the topic almost always prevails. The weighting scale amplifies that bias.

I don't want to vote for Trump or Biden,"I'm an ""undecided"" voter in that I strongly disagree with both candidates on major issues.  For example I am not at all a fan of Biden raising my taxes, but I am also not a fan of president Trump's ignoring and in some cases exacerbation of climate change.  Both also have a quite loose relationship with the truth which I have a strong distaste for even though I know that comes with the territory on politicians.  It often feels like the two parties are in a tribal war and if you are not with them you are against them.

Life is too short to get it right before it passes you by.,"I’m 25, and I’m miserable. I’m more miserable when people tell me that I shouldn’t try to do certain things that I never got to do, until I “improve myself and fix my life first”, as if the process of selfimprovement has an actual end (it’s an ongoing process, right?)

Telling me “You shouldn’t be looking for a girlfriend or getting laid until you’re financially secure”. I mean, come on, teens in high school have relationships and sex FFS. It’s just a normal part of life.

I mean geez, why can’t you enjoy things WHILE selfimproving? What’s the point of not even trying to get enjoyable experiences UNTIL you’re financially secure (which most people really aren’t, the VAST majority of employees in the US can lose their job at any time and employers don’t even need an actual reason to fire them, they can even cover up discrimination just to legally fire them!)

Maybe I’ve just spent way too much time on Reddit and the Internet in general, I don’t know.

Another thing to add, a lot of people have the mindset “Life isn’t supposed to be artificially extended, even if my life is wasted and I’m miserable, I don’t want age reversal or stopping treatment.”

I’m disregarding religious reasons for this opinion, because I’m extremely bothered by the idea of anyone (in this case God) having more control over my life than I do. 

Age reversal/stopping treatment could be possible in as little as 30-40 years. I could die before that, never to exist again, or suffer for eternity (because I haven’t suffered enough in this life). It could also just be prohibitively expensive, which is actually very reasonable to expect to be the case.

My point is, it’s foolish and going against yourself to be against this kind of technology/treatment. If you’ve missed out on a lot of your life (I’m not even talking about being in prison or anything like that) why would you be like “This is how it’s supposed to be! I don’t have much time left, but my life went the way it’s supposed to, NATURALLY! A life of financial struggling, health issues, loneliness, celibacy, abuse, etc.....” You’re telling me you wouldn’t accept a chance to reverse your age (or stop aging) so you could live life how you want?

Attractive people are 9 times out of 10 less compelling to talk to in social situations than their less attractive counterparts,"People overindulge members of the opposite sex that exemplify conventional standards of beauty in order to gain favor with them. People will facilitate conversation and express greater interest in the topics they bring up, when they otherwise wouldn't with someone of a lower standard of beauty. Overtime this places less of a burden on more attractive people to develop compelling interests and dynamic social skills to express those interests. Even members of the same sex will often times do so because having attractive friends brings an added element of desirability and social status to a friend group. 

I swear to god whenever I see a friend group out in a social setting, the more attractive members (male or female) seem more confident from afar. But upon talking to them I'm left feeling that the interaction was ultimately more shallow than if I had given the same amount of effort towards facilitating conversation with one or more of their less attractive counterparts. Even if this person and I shared similar interests, the conversation still ultimately feels less naturally fluent and more deliberately coerced than it would with someone who has to frequently work harder to maintain someone's attention and gain their approval.",ke2vhp,"I'm not gonna touch on how a ""friends group"" is an absurdly small sample size to support such a sweeping view. But, do you ever wonder if maybe other factors are weighing in on whether you have a compelling conversation with an ""attractive person""?

For example, perhaps you experience a deep sense of insecurity when talking to someone you classify as attractive because it stands to reason that you consider yourself unattractive. Perhaps this sense of imbalance of attractiveness makes you feel inferior, and that weighs on your capacity to engage in compelling conversation with them.

Or, maybe your own biases towards ""attractive people"" primes you to believe that they are less capable of engaging you in compelling discourse, and perhaps that also weighs on your experience.

Carrying a knife for self-defense is actually pretty dumb.,"**EDIT: I'm sure a bunch of more deltas could be awarded but my mind is already changed so you can stop commenting. (I'M NOT READING ANYMORE STOP COMMENTING)**

To clarify the title I'm talking about self-defense for humans, not animals.

Scenarios:

- 1

- The other guy doesn't have a knife.

- You don't have a knife

-Best case scenario, chances are no one will die, especially if you just give him your stuff or run and scream. (bonus points if you sucker punch him first)

- 2

- The other guy has a knife.

- You don't have a knife

You just give him your stuff and live another day, sure it sucks, but at least you get to live.

- 3

- The other guy doesn't have a knife

- You have a knife

Hope they don't have one hidden and kill them or hope they run? What if they don't run? Either try to kill him and not get in trouble while hoping they don't take your knife and kill them instead?

- 4

- You both have knifes

If a guy pulls a knife on you, instead of giving him your stuff you want to pull out a knife?? I mean if you have NOTHING to lose sure! KNIFE FIGHT!!

If you do I'll just go to the next guy thanks :)",o77byb,"A knife is one of the worst self defense weapons, but it's better than no weapon. Two weapons are also better than 1 weapon.

communism would be an amazing idea for society if it was applied by a mentally stable and non corrupt leader,"So communism has a terrible reputation in history but that’s primarily due to the fact that the communist leaders were corrupt maniacs. For example Mao zedong claiming to be communist when in reality he starved to death and killed millions. 

But If a leader was mentally stable and a true communist that believed everyone was equal and actually cared about people’s well-being then it would be a fantastic idea. 

Like the leader could share the wealth equally amongst the population so that there would be no poverty and starvation and homelessness either. There wouldn’t be snobby billionaires who lived in ridiculously luxury mansions or starving homeless people on the street. Everyone could have a regular apartment and a good supply of food and clothing and other necessities. Then we could achieve equality and there wouldn’t be class divides and class discrimination anymore

Catholicism is the least Christ-like Christian religion,"*I was doing an appointment on sociology when I started to dig a little too deep into Religion history and come up with this post, feel free to prove me I'm wrong because I probably am.*

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start with 3 of the well-known ten-commandments.

&gt;II -  [Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_make_unto_thee_any_graven_image) 

*IMO this is one of the biggest differences between Protestantism and Catholicism.* Catholic temples are full of statues and ""shrines"" for saints and Jesus itself, which goes directly against the second commandment.

&gt; IV - [Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remember_the_sabbath_day,_to_keep_it_holy) 

The ""holy day of the week"" was changed from Sabbath to Sunday on the [Council of Laodicea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Laodicea) by the emperor Constantine and the religious leaders of the time, the change had no biblical basis and was changed mainly for civil reasons. The catholic church still doesn't acknowledge the Sabbath as a sacred day going against what Jesus Christ use to do.

&gt;VI - [Thou shalt not murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_murder) 

I think we can all agree that the catholic church wasn't very good at following this Commandment during the middle ages.

**Greedy**

Jesus Christ lived a life of humility and poverty and taught his followers to do the same. Teaching that not only earthly possessions wouldn't do us any good after our death but would it make it harder for us to achieve the kingdom of God.

&gt;[Luke 18:24-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2018%3A24-25&amp;version=NIV) \- “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God! Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.” 

Meanwhile, the Catholic church has its own country made out of gold.

The only crown Jesus ever used in his lifetime was made out of thorns while the pope walks around in a 15-inch tall crown made out of silver cloth with a shit ton of jewels in it.

&gt;the head-dress, - is described as enriched with 48 rubies balas, 72 sapphires, 45 praxini or emeralds, numerous little balas rubies and emeralds and 66 large pearls. At the summit was a very large ruby. [*Wikipedia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_tiara)

It was also their massive Greedy that made them start selling indulgences and later inspired the now notorious book ""95 reasons why 'fuck the church'"" by Martin Luther.

 **Saints**

If I had a dime for every different figure I've seen Catholics praying to, I would have more than one dime, which isn't a lot but it is weird that it happened on a monotheistic religion.

&gt;[Ecclesiastes 9:5-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+9%3A5-6&amp;version=NIV)  
&gt;  
&gt;**5** For the living know that they will die,  
 but the dead know nothing;  
they have no further reward,  
 and even their name is forgotten.  
**6** Their love, their hate  
 and their jealousy have long since vanished;  
***never again will they have a part***  
 ***in anything that happens under the sun.***

There is nothing in the bible about praying for the saints, if anything there is the absolute opposite, saying that that they cannot interfere with anything happening under the sun, according to the bible the saints can't intercede for you because ""the dead know nothing"".

*^(obligatory sorry for bad English at the end of non-native post.)*",l1sabl,"Christ installed Peter to lead his Church before he left us, the only form of Christianity to still recognize that position, the Pope, is Catholicism.

Moreover, the “apostolic church” is recognized by the Catholic Church as the founding on the faith.

Of course there can exist a happy medium in all of this, but that is highly unlikely to be found as long as there is debate on what is “essential.” Consider the fact that the median world income is just shy of 10,000 a year. The unfortunate reality exists that the world is simply not in the place to ensure that every human being had all of their “essential” needs…and a cell phone is not actually one of those needs.

"When people talk about economics, especially when criticizing capitalism, they often make the false assumption that value is something easy to determine.","This is an opinion that **I can not fundamentally prove in some way.** If I could then I think that would be worth a paper in economics. People have tried to prove these things and gotten Nobel prizes for it (efficient market hypothesis) which may or may not mean they are true, but that is up to everyone to decide on their own.

I am just looking to argue for an idea that I believe many people don't know or see as libertarian rubbish, and to hear counter arguments against it.

My opinion is that when people talk about economics, in particular people advocating for left-wing economics and criticizing capitalism, they falsely assume that it is easy to know the value of things. If you are making an argument that in some way could be simplified to saying ""Just take money and spend it on good things"", then it is likely that the problem could be to determine how to actually spend this money. Sometimes I genuinely feel like some people don't understand what the core upside of capitalism is.

Now, everyone knows that governemnt spending of money can be very inefficient and that to the contrary it can also work quite well, so my point is not that.

My point is that on a fundamental level one can view the whole goal of the capitalist machinery as figuring out what a thing is actually worth and how much money, effort, time or ressources should be diverted to it.

The way this works is by the mechanisms of supply and demand that we all know. By doing this we are all engaging in a sort of decentralized distributed computation that assigns a value to something in a way that keeps things running smoothly, as best as possible. This does in no way ever lead to the optimal solution and causes hickups regularly (economic crises), but the historical evidence shows that it is undoubtedly the most effective, practical and efficient way to determine the value of things and base your economy on. 

Note that I am not advocating against restricting capitalism with some progressive policies or via governemtn control. These are tradeoffs that give you as a society benefits such as the following: Being able to steer what is economically happening and being able to can protect weak or unlucky individuals.

But they arestill tradeoffs in the sense that you still want to retain as much of the capitalist price-determining machinery as possible. If you completely throw that out of the window I believe the evidence shows that your economy will become extremely mismanaged and hence your people will suffer enormously.

This also explains why Billionaires having enormous amounts of money is not necessarily as obscene as it seems: Many of them do not actually consume that much, they do not extract that much ressources and work from the economy. If a Billionaire buys a billion breadrolls or orders the construction of ten thousand yachts then that does hurt the whole society, but if he just moves around his wealth from investment to investment then all he is doing is attempting to but the money to use where it is most efficient. If he does it badly he will lose money, if he does it well then he is **providing work for society**. Being a Billionaire often means you have demonstrated ability to manage large amounts of money well, so you are likely to actually do a good job.

Those are all the points I wanted to make, so far.",ui6rep,"&gt;Sometimes I genuinely feel like some people don't understand what the core upside of capitalism is.

Supply-and-demand is an element of *markets*, not capitalism.

Pirating software is ok if you are unable to pay for it,"My reasoning:-

* You cannot 'steal' software in the same way you steal physical goods. You can copy it without compromising the integrity of the original product.
* The usual argument is that by pirating it instead of buying it you are depriving the company of income. But if you are from a middle class family in a developing country you would have never spent money to buy the game anyway, simply because it would have been a luxury you cannot afford.
* Being financially dependent on my parents I cannot possibly persuade them to buy the game. But it does inculcate a love for the video game genre, and video games in general. Meaning I will start buying original copies, once I become financially independent.

In a public talk between Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and Brent Schlender at the University of Washington in 1998, Bill Gates commented on piracy as a means to an end, whereby people who use Microsoft software illegally will eventually pay for it, out of familiarity, as a country's economy develops and legitimate products become more affordable to businesses and consumers:

Although about three million computers get sold every year in China, people don't pay for the software. Someday they will, though. And as long as they're going to steal it, we want them to steal ours. They'll get sort of addicted, and then we'll somehow figure out how to collect sometime in the next decade.

It's pretty clear from an absolutist standpoint, you are obtaining something against the law and against the makers wishes for free. By using another person against their will to satisfy your own ends, you have committed an unethical act by common western absolutist systems.

From your perspective in the post, I think you're coming at this from the other way. You are arguing that there is no consequence to you pirating software with the condition that you would never have bought it anyway. No money was going to the company regardless, right? No harm no foul!

To this argument, I would say you are making an unfounded assumption that you would never buy the software. You may not buy it right now, but you can't really say for certain that you would *never* buy it in the future. What if your financial situation changes (job, lottery, inheritance)? What if someone would buy it for you? What if you changed your tastes, values, or priorities over time? All of these things are possible, so your assertion that ""I would never buy it"" is not a certainty.

Now that we have established that it is not certain that you would never have bought the software at any point in your life, it is much easier to back up the many comments in this thread that that speak to  consequences of your piracy to the developers.

All intellectual property is subject to this kind of logic. Imagine if you wrote a song, painted a scene, or made a game with the intention of selling it, but everyone just took it from you for free because ""they wouldn't have paid you anyway.""

"The phrase ""Conspiracy Theory"" works to undermine belief in actual conspiracies","The phrase ""conspiracy theory"" is defined to mean ""a theory that rejects the standard explanation for an event and instead credits a covert group or organization with carrying out a secret plot."" It has become shorthand for explaining away all sorts of outlandish beliefs, such as the earth being flat, or chemtrails, or ""The Illuminati"" secretly controlling world events, to name just a few. It has become synonymous with the ""tin foil hat"" crowd who are somehow manipulated into believing things that require extraordinary leaps in logic or significant faith without evidence. 

However, actual conspiracies do exist. An actual conspiracy is a secret plan by a group to do something harmful or unlawful. When more than one person is involved in the planning, coordination, or execution of a crime, it's a criminal conspiracy.  The entire 9/11 operation was a conspiracy insofar as it involved multiple coordinated actors executing an unlawful plan. The Iran/Contra affair was a conspiracy. The Nancy Kerrigan assault was a conspiracy. You get the idea. Before these conspiracies were proven, anyone investigating them was by definition investigating a ""conspiracy theory"" insofar as they had a ""theory"" that there was a ""conspiracy"" behind the crime. 

My view is that the phrase ""conspiracy theory"" has come to imply that any alleged ""conspiracy"" is a *de facto* unhinged belief that lacks sufficient supporting evidence to be taken seriously. This makes it difficult to separate *actual* conspiracies, which do exist, from the kind of silly, strange, and outrageous beliefs that have come to define ""conspiracy theory"".  

Change my view!",k3y14a,"I feel like the exact opposite is true...hear me out...

While I agree with you that the term conspiracy theory can be viewed and used in the manner you suggest, it is also important to recognize that those who are open minded will not view it that way and likely believe in some conspiracies...and those who are not open minded will continue living in their bubble...and even if we came up with a new term for the theory of a conspiracy they would still view it and use the term in that same way to make fun of it and make it lose credibility.

It is a people problem, not a language problem...just like every other term/word that has been stigmatized like conspiracy theory has. The way I see it...the more they do that to the word, the more power it gives the conspiracy. Kind of counterintuitive since you would think that it would prevent people from looking into it and taking conspiracy theorists and whistleblowers seriously...but what really happens is it creates the same effect that the war on drugs has. You can't silence the truth...it is impossible. The more ""bad"" you make something, the more people become interested in it!

It also maddens conspiracy believers that the term is used this way and fuels their advocacy/vocalization/passion for getting other people to see the truth or at least be open to possibilities.

TLDR...the cmv is that it is actually helpful and helps promote conspiracy deniers become agnostics and conspiracy believers to become more fervent in their vocalization of them.",ge65ku0,3.6
diversity hiring is fucked,"I am a college educated white male, and a recruiter in STEM. I believe employers should actively take measures which even the playing field with underrepresented groups in STEM. I also believe that people from diverse backgrounds provide value to an organization that cannot be attained any other way than by hiring people from diverse communities. I’m not sure if affirmative action actually exists but that kind of shit is great. I’m basically pro diversity. I’m trying to say diversity is great. The title of this post implies I hold the opposite view than I have just stated, so allow me to clarify what I mean.

As recruiters our job is to identify, attract, and engage with qualified talent that meets our business needs. If we are trying to increase, say, female representation in executive leadership positions, it seems logical that you would have your recruiters proactively seek out female executive candidates in order to interview and hire them. If we don’t even try to find a woman, odds are we will find a man, because there are more men than women in STEM. Thus it falls on recruiters by default to make diverse hires .

However, we have literally one, single lever to perform diversity recruitment, and that is to dedicate time every week to contact only diverse candidates. That means scanning Linkedin for people and judging, based on their profile picture, whether they are diverse; and only contacting those people, while passing over the rest.

There’s literally nothing else I can do to perform “diversity recruitment” besides spending my time only contacting minority candidates, and doing that based on their physical appearance. That’s one lever. I feel like diversity and inclusion should be more comprehensive than this singular activity. Even if I didn’t despise doing this mindless and insulting activity, then we’re only poaching talent from other companies. Thus we aren’t helping any communities besides our own.

If we really wanted to have a diversity and inclusion program in our talent organization, the responsibility shouldn’t be on recruiters and their one fucking lever. A better approach would be company sponsorship for academic programs and organizations which do the actual work. A more ethical and longer term approach is to create net new, diverse candidates through educational channels. Not by choosing who to poach and inmail.

Please convince me that choosing to contact minority people based on their Linkedin Profile picture benefits the communities we are trying to help.

"While NFTs are dumb, they aren't any different than abstract art","While I think the concept is interesting, like many others, I don't appreciate what NFTs have become and the hype around them, and how NFT owners are acting like they are amazing - while they aren't.

But I don't understand why people are acting like it's a horrible non-sensible pyramid scheme, and not simply dumb just like abstract art.

In my mind it's a perfect analogy, but opinions online seem to make it out to be much worse.

- Both are only worth something because someone paid for it.
- Both can be made by anyone and don't (always) require much talent.
- Both are used for money laundering/status symbols and not actually for art.
- Both are easily reproducible.

[Dan Olsen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g) released an incredible piece just yesterday delving into the specifics. It is a couple hours to watch, and fairly entertaining if you are curious, but the gist is this.

NFTs exist solely as a scam. Abstract art might be (and often is) stupid and full of scams, but NFTs are scams all the way down. Specifically, you said:

&gt;I don't appreciate what NFTs have become

NFTs have not 'become' anything. They were pointless tokens designed as just one more way to encourage rubes to invest in crypto so the people already there could cash out. The concept, like basically the entirety of the crypto market, has been nothing but a scam since its inception.",hts0in6,3.5
Its wrong for r/blackpeopletwitter to limit comments to verified black users,"The whole “BPT country club” system is fucked up and should not be allowed in a comment thread. It’s a thread for *Comments*, you know, components of *discussion*.

It would be like if /r/conservative didn’t allow non-conservatives to post, and created a deliberate echo chamber. - wait. I guess they sort of do as well.

It would be like if /r/politics banned comments from anyone right-leaning.

I get that it focuses on a historically persecuted (not to suggest it’s in the past) minority group and there must be certain instances of ugly people saying despicable things. But why not just delete problematic comments and ban repeat offenders, etc.? I mean something kind of based around the concept of uh.. oh! you know every single other subreddit? 

Im **not** saying the policy is racist, (though I do think it’s worth pointing out that /r/whitepeopletwitter or /r/scottishpeopletwitter could never get away with this. But arguing that is a bit like complaining “hOw CoMe white people never get affirmative action?!?” - just shut up) but what I am saying is that broad swath exclusion creates echo chambers, and widens a chasm between societies that, in this instance, was already pretty fucking gaping, it doesn’t need widening. And when you live in 2 different worlds, even if you live next door, it only furthers that “Us vs. Them” mentality. Which leads to increased tribalism.

Conservatives, black people, and other Reddit minority groups create separate spaces for themselves where they can interact without the influence of mainstream Reddit culture. This creates an echo chamber, but only because mainstream Reddit already functions as a de facto echo chamber.

The majority of the BLM protestors are hypocrites.," 

Before I begin, I want to clarify: I believe that George Floyd was wronged by the police, there needs to be significant reform with regards to police regulation and brutality, especially towards the African-American community. My frustration is specifically towards the BLM protests as a result of this injustice.

I am Asian-American, first generation. I've lived in many places, from both coasts to many places in the Midwest. One thing that is almost universal is a distaste for Asians - I've been called every name in the book (chink and gook once being used in the same sentence, even though that makes no sense...), been pulled over by police for extremely trivial things, had property vandalized because I was Asian, and so forth. My experience is not unique; many friends have had similar things happen to them.

Even now, with the lens of racism being focused on police brutality: people are villifying Tou Thao for anti-blackness for standing by and doing nothing (which I believe he is STILL in the wrong for, don't get me wrong), while completely ignoring the other two officers Thomas Lane and J. Alex Kueng (who is debatably black himself) who were active in George Floyd's death. People also completely ignore Asian businesses who are being destroyed by these protests ( [https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/devastated-business-owner-likely-wont-reopen-after-looting/2283316/](https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/devastated-business-owner-likely-wont-reopen-after-looting/2283316/) ) and focused only on supporting black businesses. They are crucifying Asian people for speaking out for themselves ( [https://nextshark.com/nicky-park-black-lives-matter/](https://nextshark.com/nicky-park-black-lives-matter/) ) and portraying them as vehement racists, when it much more seems like they're frustrated with the hypocrisy.

There are almost uncountable instances of violence towards Asians and Asian-Americans recently, and aside from a few published articles, nobody cared. There were no protests, there were no broad social media campaigns. Where were the protests for Vincent Chin, an innocent man beat to death by two white racists who got away with it? Where were the protests for Yoshihiro Hattori, an innocent man shot to death by a man who got away with it?

I won't go into other forms institutionalized racism against Asian-Americans (see: affirmative action, which affects Asian people disproportionately compared to even whites, and essentially no representation in mainstream American media), but I'll focus on just BLM for now: There are so many calls for other POC to defend the BLM movement, and as much as I am disgusted by George Floyd's death, I cannot help but think they would not do the same for me were I under the knee.

**tldr: Black lives 100% matter, but it seems like other POC lives don't.**",gwkuzu,"A lot of Black people (such as myself) stood up for Chinese folks. In fact I'm pretty sure the hotline for racism against Chinese was created by Letitia James, a black woman.

SETI and other research groups sending signals out to space in hopes of extraterrestrial life responding should stop,"I should start by saying that if you aren't familiar with The Dark Forest Theory, here is a quick and simplified [article](https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/the-dark-forest-theory-a-terrifying-explanation-of-why-we-havent-heard-from-aliens-yet/) that best explains it. I will also be touching on it below.



Until we have a better understanding of our universe and have achieved enough technological advancements to properly defend ourselves against a potentially hostile and advanced civilization, we shouldn't be trying to reach out to them and signaling that we are here.

The reason I believe this is because at our current state, if we do broadcast our location and it is picked up by a civilization that turns out to not only be hostile, but also advanced enough to traverse the massive distance of space to reach us, we have lost already. It would be the equivalent of signing our own death wish.

Using the Drake Equation, it's theorized that there could be at least 20 different civilizations in our own cosmic neighborhood. Which in itself is incredible considering we have yet to find any evidence of such.

Now you may ask, if a civilization does exist and is that advanced, hostile or not, why haven't they found us or at the very least made their presence known.

The answer to that could potentially be that they understand the dangers and are remaining in silence. Observing from the dark and moving/acting accordingly as to protect themselves. We also should follow in suit and only communicate with another civilization once we know more about them, and confirm that revealing ourselves would be a manageable course on the off chance that they are hostile.


Now you also may ask, why would a civilization that advanced not only be hostile, but also hostile to a less advanced civilization like ourselves? 

I think the answer to this is quite simple. On earth, we've observed that all life share one major aspect with each other for the most part, a desire to stay alive. Regardless of the level of sentience in most creatures, when presented with a potential threat, regardless of validity or not, they will choose to value their own lives and preserve it. It is the key driving force behind evolution. It only makes sense that this shared ideology within most life here on earth would also translate to other potential life in the universe. There is no way to know if other lifeforms can and will destroy you if given the chance. 


Now with all that said, my belief is that we should stop sending out signals and instead focus on developing our space surveillance technology. Only making our presence known to other civilizations when know of them, as well as knowing that we are 100% sure they either pose no hostility or threat to us, or if they do, we have the means to defend ourselves.",vch41l,"Why does an advanced civilization wait to see signs of civilization?

Why do they even wait to see signs of life?

If you are a civilization with the goal of denying other civilizations, then you can fire off impactors sufficient to massively disrupt a biosphere and hamper the development of multicellular life of every planet in a solar system once every 10 years and guarantee that you have no threat from millions of solar systems. These impactors don't have to be capable of a lot technologically speaking, just accelerate to a coasting velocity and then perform trajectory adjustment as they approach the system. This technology is entirely reasonable for any civilization capable of interstellar travel, if they are not capable of it I'd question their ability to even harm us.",icfs4tb,3.0
People need to stop remaking Cinderella 😭,"People keep retelling the same story of “Mistreated girl gets the guy and they get married”, for once I’d like to see the original story advertised. Now that’d be a good movie.

I’ve seen so many ads for different types of Cinderella that I just don’t care for anymore. There’s a finite amount of times someone can keep ripping off the same story over and over.

When you look up Cinderella the original story doesn’t even show up anymore, at least not first thing.

And - before anyone says anything because I know how the people on reddit are, I don’t mention LGBTQ Cinderella the imply that I’m homophobic, I mention it simply because it’s one of the thousands of remade Cinderella movies that have been released over the years.

"I think abortion is a very complex etichal subject, and that discussions of abortion are almost always oversimplified.","**Edit: Most of the comments here seem to regard the legality of abortion in the US. I therefore want to point out a few things:**

**I am not asking or questioning whether aborting should be legal. If you want to convince me that abortion should be legal, please save your time. I already agree with you. If you want to discuss the ethics of abortions within a society where it is legal, please comment below. I would love to talk to you.**

**Also, a lot of people seem to assume that I'm a republican American. I am neither.**

Now, on to the original post:

________________________________

Whenever abortion is discussed or talked about it seems to me that most people fall into one of two camps: 

One one hand you have those who think abortion is akin to murder, and obviously should be banned. 
 
On the other you have a lot of people who seem to think that anyone who is sceptical to abortions must be some sort of religious fanatic, and that abortions are obviously not problematic. 

I know there are many people who don't fall in to any of these camps, of course, but the discussion of abortion is almost always very polarized and polarizing. And I don't feel like either side ever talks about how complex I feel the moral question of abortion is. 

Let me first be clear: I don't support the Supreme Court of the United States' decision regarding RvW. And I think living in a society where access to legal abortions (with some limitations regarding how far into the pregnancy an abortion can be performed) is better than the alternative. 

Also I think sex-Ed and access to good and cheap contraception, as well as better support for young and low income mothers and children are the best ways to reduce the number of abortions in a society, and that this should be highly prioritized. 

All that said, I still think abortion is an extremely complex moral issue. Even if I think abortion should be legal, at least to some extent, I can't help but feel that abortion often to some extent is ending one life (even if it is not a full human life yet) in favor of the convenience of another. 

There are of course good reasons to support abortions: It must be extremely hard to raise an unplanned and unwanted child. Family planning is extremely important when it comes to getting out of poverty, and of course there are many cases where it is necessary from a medical standpoint. Not to speak of cases such as rape, incest etc. There are of course many more arguments here, and I won't go too much into them as I suppose this is the prevailing opinion, and as such it seems unnecessary. 

On the other hand, I think there also are reasons that abortions in many cases are morally problematic, and this has to do with what value we assign to the fetus. First of, if you are to allow abortions, almost everyone agrees that there need to be a limit to when a pregnancy can be terminated legally. At some point the fetus becomes a human. And I think any concrete line we draw is really subjective and unconvincing. I really struggle to see why a fetus is 'just a clump of cells' one day, and a human the next. If I were to draw such a line, conception seems to be the only logically consistent option.

The alternative seems to be some sort of sliding scale. And if there is a sliding scale that means that the fetus at all points to some extent is a human, if not fully. If so an abortion is ending the life of something that to some extent is human. And even if it is not a full human life, that is something I think deserves careful consideration, before it is ended for the convenience of another. This does not mean in my opinion that abortion is never right. But it does seem to me that it means that abortion rarely is obviously and unquestionably right

Also I find the 'my body'-line of arguments hard to agree with. The fetus has another DNA profile than the mother. That makes it quite clear to me that it is not literally part of the mother's body (or, even if I should accept that it at one point is part of the mother's body, we are back to the above argument - at which point does that change?) 

That is not to say that the wishes and opinions of the mother is unimportant in any way, far from it! But I don't think the fact that the fetus exists inside the mothers body removes the moral difficulty conserning abortion. 

So to sum up: You don't have to convince me that abortions should be legal. I'm pretty much on board there. 

But I do think that there are good reasons to consider it a very complex issue, and not nearly as black or white as most people seem to make it. 

I do think that a lot of conservatives oversimplifies the issue, by saying it is plain wrong and to not consider the impact an unwanted pregnancy can have on the mother and those around her. But I disagree just as much with those who seem to claim that it's just a medical procedure, which does not have etichal considerations connected with it. 

I would love to hear opinions different than mine on this issue - hence this post. I would love to hear your thoughts.",vqlmds,"The thing of it is, even the most pro-choice (and still rational and not some kind of edgy antinatalist) person won't say it's not a nuanced issue, or that abortion isn't a very difficult decision.

After all, a grown woman considering an abortion might feel like she's straddling the edge of two timelines, each one *vastly* different than the other, and she might not even know which one will lead to more happiness. (Of course, not everyone who needs an abortion is even a grown woman, which is one of the fucked up parts. Why should we force 10 year old children to give birth?)

The issue is that from a strictly *legal* standpoint, it's pretty clear. The issue is that *even if* we assume that abortion is killing another human being, abortion would still have be legal anyway. Nobody is saying you have to like it or think it's a moral good, just that it should be completely legal.

No one is ever, in any other context, required to sustain someone else's life with their own body. Even if *your own child* needs an organ transplant to survive, the state can't force you to undergo the surgery. You'd have the choice to refuse, de facto sentencing them to death. Because if you don't own and control your own body...you essentially don't own anything at all, and have no real rights. It's the most basic right there is.

Yes, some pro-choice people use weaker arguments than this, but this is the actual crux of the issue--it's a human rights issue first and foremost; anything else about ""clumps of cells"" or whatever is just frippery. Do I think the minute sperm fuses with egg, a new person exists? No, but that's not even my main motivator. Some pro-choicers get caught up in that and fail to argue the main point about basic human rights.

Or, they argue in different ways simply to show the hypocrisy of the anti-choice crowd.",ieqb3pu,3.6666666666666665
"There is a correlation between the quality of ""native"" food and the type of Christianity prevalent in a region in Europe","I would argue certain regions have better ""native"" food and by extend a general higher appreciation of food culture than others. Not only that, but people tend to enjoy food more, see it as a pleasure and not only food in these regions.

Countries with a mostly Catholic/Orthodox heritage: Italy, Spain, France, Greece, the Balkans, to name a few, all have in my opinion really good local food. It is fairly easy to find restaurants  aligned with theses cultures all over Europe. (frankly the world)

Countries with Protestant heritage: GB, the Scandinavian countries... aren't really known for good food. I've never thought ""You know what would be awesome, English food"", and there aren't really restaurants serving food like this.

Further evidence for this is Germany.  In Germany is split between a Protestant north and a Catholic south. In the south (Bavaria) the food is good, people enjoy to eat. In the north quality gets worse, people don't eat for enjoyment, rather they eat for ""fuel""

Protestantism in simple terms was the answer to the over the top rich Catholicism at the time and went to a simpler style, which also influenced the food culture. (also evident in comparing Protestant and  non Protestant churches)

I know correlation isn't causation but in this case it fits too good imo. Maybe I'm overlooking some different factors that would cause this split so please cmv

Videos should not be required in video conferences in which you are working from home,"I am a first-year college student studying from home. Most of our teachers have been accommodating when it comes to turning on videos, but one of my classes I'm in currently the TA said that videos are required to be on and if we don't want to have our cameras on we have to seek an official university-approved accommodation.

I do online tutoring as well, and my boss said that I had to turn my video on so that the kids can see me. She also wants to kids to have their video on but more than half of them do not even when I ask them (which I am required to do as per her instructions). 

I do not believe that I or the kids at home should be required to have our cameras on because people's home lives are not conducive to learning, not everyone has the privilege to have a clean space to themselves to work, and home life can be rough which causes people to not look their best on camera. I believe cameras on is very different than in person classes. Even with a green screen, I also think that having a camera on induces stress on people because they are concerned about how they appear on camera and cannot be comfortable enough to learn. 

I understand that a big concern is making sure students actually are in class listening and not off doing other things, but I don't think this outweighs the students' need for privacy in their own homes.

Apart from the reasons the other commenters are giving why video is important, I don't really see why your issues with it are issues at all.  If you were capable of being presentable enough for in-person classes/tutoring, what stops you from doing the same things for an at home class? If anything you have more time to prepare due to not needing to commute.

&gt; have our cameras on because people's home lives are not conducive to learning

You just mean a messy house that would be in the background of the camera?  You don't have a single blank wall in your home that you could put behind yourself? Or can't shove the mess in camera view just out of the way?  Or you could apply a background filter.  Or hang something behind yourself like a sheet.  Unless you can't leave the camera in a fixed spot during the call, there are a number of pretty easy ways to avoid having even a hoarders house look messy on camera by just having a wall or other tiny clear area behind you.

&gt; students' need for privacy in their own homes

Seeing what you look like is a privacy you give up without question when you attend school in person.  You'd hardly even call that privacy.  The only way in which this is more invasive is that you can see a small patch of your home's wall behind you, which I just don't see why it is such a problem to control that small section even in the worst of houses to just be empty and have nothing privacy violating in it.",gx1vm4x,3.6
"""Folks"" is a reasonably inclusive, gender neutral term, and spelling it as ""folx"" is purely virtue signaling","I just want to start by saying this might be the only instance of something that I would actually, unironically call ""virtue signaling"" -- a term I usually disdain and find dismissive of social progress. But in this case, that's exactly what I think it is. 

""Folks"" is an inclusive word. It means ""people."" It is inherently gender neutral. It is perhaps one of the few English words to address a group of people that is totally inclusive and innocuous. In a time when we are critically evaluating the inclusiveness of language, one would think we're lucky to have a word as neutral and applicable as ""folks."" 

But apparently, people are intent on spelling it ""folx,"" with the ""x"" indicating inclusiveness. But adding a trendy letter to a word doesn't make the word more inclusive if the word was already inclusive. ""Folks"" didn't exclude people who were non-binary (for instance), because it inherently means ""people"" -- so unless you think non-binary folx aren't *people*, then they were already included and accepted in that term.

I understand there is value in making sure that language is obviously inclusive when speaking to people who may otherwise feel excluded. So, I understand there may be *some* value in taking a word that is potentially vague in its inclusiveness, and tweaking it in a way that is more inclusive. As an example, I understand the intent and value in the term ""latinx"" (which could be its own discussion, but I'm just citing it as a contrary example here). Regardless of someone's feelings on ""latinos/latinas,"" ""latinx"" is a substantive change that would, in theory, have more inclusiveness for those who might feel othered by the gendered terms.  

But ""folx"" doesn't add or change anything on a substantive level. It is purely a spelling change in a situation where the original spelling was not problematic or exclusive. It uses the letter ""x"" as a reference to the fact that ""x"" has become a signifier of inclusiveness, thereby showing that the user supports inclusiveness. But if people wouldn't have felt excluded otherwise, then signifying this is purely for the user's own ego -- to say, ""Look at what type of person I am; you should feel accepted by me."" Signaling that you're a good person in a way that doesn't change anything else or help your audience (since there wasn't a problem to begin with) is, by definition, virtue signaling. 

The only conceivable reason I see for the rally behind ""folx"" is the historical usage of ""volk"" in Germany, when Nazi Germany referred to ""the people"" as part of their nationalist identity. But 1) that's a different word in a different language which carries none of that baggage in English-speaking cultures; 2) it's a such a common, generally applicable word that its inclusion within political rhetoric shouldn't forever change the world itself, especially given its common and unproblematic usage for decades since then; and 3) this feels like a shoe-horned, insincere argument that someone might raise as a way to retroactively inject purpose into what is, in actuality, their virtue signaling. And if you were previously unfamiliar with this argument from German history, then that underscores my point about how inconsequential it is to Western English-speaking society. 

People who spell it as ""folx"" are not mitigating any harm by doing so, and are therefore doing it purely for their own sense of virtue. CMV.

*Addendum*: I'm not arguing for anyone to stop using this word. I'm not saying this word is harmful. I'm not trying to police anyone's language. I'm saying the word's spelling is self-serving and unhelpful relative to other attempts at inclusive language.    

*Addendums*: By far the most common response is an acknowledgement that ""folks"" is inclusive, but also that ""folx"" is a way to signal that the user is an accepting person. I don't see how this isn't, by definition, virtue signaling.

*Addendum 3*: I'm not making a claim of how widespread this is, nor a value judgment of how widespread it should be, but I promise this is a term that is used among some people. Stating that you've never seen this used doesn't contribute to the discussion, and claiming that I'm making this up is obnoxious.

"The ""system"" that needs to change in light of recent events is the American education system and Academia writ large.","Like most of the world, I have been taking a good, hard look at what needs to change in America in light of the George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, et al. cases. In the midst of research, a thought crossed my mind that I haven't been able to shake. This is all a failure of the American education system, teachers and academia as a whole for one of two reasons: 

EITHER 

1) The American education system, and teachers in particular, have acted in bad faith, knowingly teaching a false side of history, and intentionally leaving out the racism that runs through every fiber of the country to this day. This failure has continued to perpetuate the evils of this evil system at the expense of the poorest in the country, and people of color specifically. The outrageous events that have occurred in the last few months are nothing new, and the lack of fortitude to correctly teach the vast evils of this current system directly allows these types of events to continue. The vast majority of Americans grow up being taught and thinking that this country is a ""city of a hill,"" which comes directly from American school systems.

OR 

2) America really was founded on the ideas of freedom, individual liberty, and democracy, and a new way of living and thinking that valued human dignity and rights. No doubt, racism has existed throughout the history of the country, but history up until this point has been a continuous struggle in the right direction, towards liberty and justice for all. In fact, the foundational principles (and institutions) of the country have provided a fertile ground for social justice movements to enact real change. If this is the case, our educators are doing a tremendous disservice right now in allowing the narrative to be structured in a way that characterizes the country as inherently evil, and we need historians and teachers to stand up for truth. Allowing people to change history to fit their own narrative will destroy the oldest surviving democratic nation in the world, and allowing the loudest voice to define truth is tantamount to supporting fascism.

It is no surprise the world overall is becoming less religious in the 21st century,"Many consequences of the sexual revolution including greater acceptance of unusual gender identities and sexual preferences, greater access to birth control and abortion are things that most religions find abhorrent and sinful. Many people choose to pursue those sexual paths rather than conform to a religion that says what they are tempted to do in the bedroom is a sin.

Because of the hyper individualism merged with capitalism that comes from catered Netflix lists, Facebook feeds and Spotify playlists, more and more people want the world to conform to them and not vice versa. So, they often expect the same thing from religion, which has led to some churches turning into Christian rock concerts with very different doctrinal interpretations than what they professes a couple decades ago. In trying to appeal more to people who don't like religion as much, they lose their parishioners who were their core base to begin with.

However, there are many religions which decide to stick to their doctrine and thus lose activity or membership because they don't support gay marriage.

Add moral relativism, shortened attention spans and a growing population of people who would rather pursue their own pleasure on a holy day when the higher power they can't appreciate because they view a relationship with it as very transactional, and you have a world that values religion less. If they do have a religion, they want it to lull them into a sense of false security telling then that they're good people, not to tell them that they might be sinning and can have eternal consequences for it, mich like the drugs and alcohol they use on the regular.

"Board-certified physicians should not be replaced with independent midlevel providers, such as nurse practitioners or physician assistants. And a ""Doctor of Nursing Practice"" is a way to trick patients into thinking nurses are doctors.","A large healthcare tech company essentially runs on the notion that patients don't really know who they are seeing: a physician, a physician assistant or a nurse practitioner and that they are all basically interchangeable.  This seems unethical to me.

Recently there has been a study released from Medicare showing that patients seen by physicians actually have lower cost of care and more accurate diagnoses compared to patients seen entirely by midlevel providers - which are nurse practitioners or physician assistants. 

Physicians go to college for 4 years, then medical school for 4 years, 1 research year, 3 years of additional residency training, 1 year of specialization fellowship training and now see patients as a board-certified doctor. 

Nurse practitioners do 4 years of college and then a 1-2 year program, which can even be an online degree. They apparently can then do another year, which can also be an online degree, and start calling themselves ""Doctor"" because they then have a ""Doctor of Nurse Practice"".  They could have chosen the name ""Masters in Nurse Practice"" but they specifically chose ""Doctor"".  I find this extremely odd and irritating because even as a doctor of nursing, one is still a nurse.  It seems that the political agenda behind this is that lawmakers will think that with this extra label, perhaps nurses will be granted permission to practice on their own without the supervision of a physician.  This way, hospitals and businesses can also line their pockets with more money because it costs less to hire a non-physician that can act like a physician but they can still charge patients the same amount. (Since the pandemic, they were granted special permissions to be independent - but I don't think that is a good permanent solution.)

I feel this is really pulling the wool over patients' eyes.  Just because there are online degree mills, doesn't mean we should be okay with this and let it go on - especially in a healthcare system that is already really broken and often not trustworthy.  There is also evidence from the same Medicare study that midlevel providers don't actually help with physician shortages because they don't go to rural areas but rather stay in cities and try to work where most physicians work and there is already good access to healthcare.   

I do believe midlevel providers are helpful in healthcare and can be physician ""extenders"" but only if they are supervised.",um7obu,"if you are a person with an active RN license (this can be an associates, bachelors, or masters degree) as well as a master’s degree or a DNP (prior to which you need the bachelors in nursing), and you pass the appropriate boards, you are a nurse practitioner. DNP degrees are doctoral programs where you take courses, complete hundreds of clinical hours, and conduct research, and can also be as long as four years. you don’t “do a 1-2 year program (even online!) and then maybe do an extra year to call yourself doctor.” you are certified and licensed to see patients independently (yes, independently, without a physician to sign off on everything you do), prescribe medication, make referrals, work in an interdisciplinary care team, etc. you’re not “still a nurse that acts like a doctor.” if the provider introduces themselves/signs off as an NP to their patients, what’s the problem? 

i saw your post on AITA before it was removed, where you said you think DNPs are worthless degrees designed so that those who hold a DNP can simply call themselves a doctor. you seem to have a fundamental disdain for nursing practice and look down upon those people who work hard for their degrees under the guise of thinking nurse practitioners seek to intentionally deceive patients. they earned their degrees.",i809e33,3.8
Childhood obesity (morbid) should be considered child abuse (in the vast majority of cases).,"Like the title says, morbid childhood obesity should be considered child abuse/negect and the parents (and or guardians) should have full accountability in this regard.

I can see a few circumstances where it might not apply - medical conditions for instance, or if the child is out of control and has access to funds and large amounts of unhealthy food outside of the home.

Unless there's any evidence to the contrary, I can't see any benefit of being a morbidly obese child. General health deterioration, early onset of many diseases (diabetes), not to mention the psychological effects of bullying are all possibilities that could be curbed by a healthier diet.

Essentially I'm saying if you make your kid morbidly obese, there should be consequences.

Change my view.

EDIT: I am arguing that we should change the definition of child abuse/neglect to include ""causing morbid childhood obesity""

EDIT2: ""child neglect"" may have been the better term to use here - I've updated the post

EDIT3: Thanks for all the great responses - I'm running around all day and I'm working through them.

As a general response: Many people have raised the issue of healthy food being more expensive - I'm not convinced of this. There are many healthy options for cheap - I'm holding a can of black beans in my hands right now -- 130 cals for a serving (1/2 cup), 8g protein, lots of fiber, lots of carbs for energy, only 1g sugar. Beans are dirt cheap and delicious. I think that people need only look to the ""peasant foods"" around the world to see how amazing and healthy dishes are totally possible even on a limited budget.

EDIT4: I used to term ""whale"" - perhaps it was insensitive. Sorry for being a dick. I'm not bullying any kids - I'm saying this to get across what the bullies might be saying to them at school. Either way - it's not addressing the issue. Asshole or not, you need to address the original point of the post and not just attack my character and psychoanalyze my past over the internet.

EDIT5: I'm not advocating for the state to immediately take away children. I'm advocating for something to be done about the situation (which in my mind is clearly morally wrong). I'm not sure what - maybe you guys have some ideas 

EDIT6: As a final edit - I'd like to reiterate MORBID OBESITY. I'm talking about kids that are barely able to walk around or up stairs without losing breath. This is neglect.",s0gsic,"Parents who have extremely obese children are often extremely obese themselves and overwhelmingly face obstacles for managing their own weight in the way that you describe.

The matter of culpability that may take some additional effort to empathize with. Many institutional and societal factors play into the obesity epidemic besides individual choice.  

* Food Addiction
* Poor coping mechanisms 
* Other compounding addictions (alcohol, cigarettes)
* Poor knowledge of nutrition
* Lack of support systems
* Low access to healthy food (read up on food deserts in rural areas etc)
* Existing within a culture of unhealthy eating
* Not having the time or mobility to cook
* Being fed unhealthy meals within the context of institutions (workplace, school meals, etc)
* Mobility issues, handicaps, and chronic diseases which hinder the ability to exercise 

Most people who are obese or have obese children would like for this to not be the case, but many feel helpless to do so and lack the resources to make changes as I've listed above.

&amp;#x200B;

Their capacity to spontaneously switch to eating a whole plant diet based on the canned beans, whole bread, and shitty, watery produce, found in their local Piggly Wiggly is exaggerated. They'd have to walk past all the foods that give them relief from the flood of bad emotions they constantly experience then go home feed beans to their kids in front of a constant flow of pepsi and McDonalds commercials brainwashing them to indulge.  Their children would give them absolute hell if they tried, and the amount of stress they currently have in their life probably has them on the breaking point as it is.

I'm not saying it isn't possible, or that people shouldn't try, they should. It's possible to spontaneously overcome one's circumstances. But it's hard and usually takes some outside force to initiate and guide that extreme of a change.

Does calling them abusers or taking their kids away fix the problem? No. Their kids keep all their passed down propensities for obesity with the additional stressor of having every facet of their life in flux in the foster system.

Does providing support and resources for addressing the list of problems help? Yes. Does providing positive incentives to encourage certain behaviours? Yes. And they're less expensive than separating families, prosecuting them, or blaming them as individuals for society's maladies.",hs3gyht,4.25
"If a manga is agreed by most of its fans to have had an awful final arc and ending, it is perfectly fine for an anime adaptation to go the anime-only route to try to salvage it.","Shokugeki No Souma, Bleach, and Nanatsu No Taizai all had a downward spiral in quality towards their endings. So why shouldn't the people making the anime adaptations try to go in a different direction than those manga took?

Just perfectly repeating what most of those manga's fans already thought was shit but in anime form makes no sense from a financial perspective. If they already hated what the manga did why would they want to see it again but animated? And people who were anime-only fans to begin with could end up dropping the show once they see how much worse it gets.

If you go down the anime-only route with a manga that got worse there's at least a possibility of a bad story being made better and enticing fans who hated what the manga did, but a 1 to 1 adaptation of a generally hated final arc of a manga is doomed to repeat the failings of its source material. 

I understand respecting the author's intent but i'm doubtful that doing that is as important as making a product more people have a chance of enjoying and actually wanting to watch.",gbcp1i,"Even if the ending is bad. I'd rather have the original authors vision animated. Its their story. So if its not them writing it. Whats even the point. Its just fan fiction at that point 

Like in Naruto for example, I really hate the ending. In both the anime and the manga its really bad. But especially in the anime, the decided to never adapt the actual ending. And end with 20 episodes of novel adaptations. To a point where we never see Naruto become the Hokage in Naruto Shippuden. Despite that being the entire point of the show. 

And Anime exclusive endings have a really good chance to be pretty bad. Or at least really out of character. Unless they're written by the original Author. Which almost never happens

 I'm sure a lot of people disagree with me. But something I've noticed is that every good manga has its own unique style. Thats completely un replaceable. Like Bleach for example. The Bleach ending isn't super good. But it is very in the style of Kubo. Kubo has every arc end anticlimacticly. Soul Society for example. Ichigo being taken over by the hollow made his victory completely meaningless. And than immediately after he gets one shot. Or Grimmjow Vs. Ichigo, he sure beat Ichigo. But immediately after got beaten by Nnoitora. Or the Ulquiorra fight, he lost to Ulquiorra. And than got taken over by his hollow and almost killed Uryu. Or Ichigo Vs. Aizen. He just didn't win. Urahara did. Now do I like the ending of Bleach? Not particularly no. But if it gets completely changed. Its just not Bleach anymore. So why would I want to watch it? Same goes with any series.

"Choosing not to vote says that you are content enough with the way that the government is currently run, not that you’re protesting the selection of candidates.","I was speaking with a friend of mine earlier this week about voting.  I had already filled out my mail ballot, and asked him how he was going to go about voting for this election.  He told me that he was not planning on voting, and gave two points on why he made this decision:

* ""Voting for the lesser of two evils is still voting for evil.""
* ""\[He\] would vote for a third-party, but because they're not likely to win, why bother wasting time to go vote when it won't really matter?""

These aren't verbatim quotes, but that's essentially what I understood he was saying.  He wasn't interested in pursuing that conversation further with me, and truthfully neither was I, but I was still curious about the implications of this decision.

From my current perspective, I can see two stances being argued based on the decision not to vote:

1. **""I don't like the stances of the two major candidates, and I refuse to vote for one just because I dislike another candidate more.  I disagree with the ways that either of the two major candidates would run this country, and** ***choosing not to vote says that I refuse to support either candidate.*****""**  This seems to be the stance of my friend, who to my knowledge has done at least some research into both the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates.  He disagrees with a number of the positions that either candidate holds to on various issues, and justifies his decision to not vote primarily on this.
2. ""**Not liking the stances of the two major candidates is not a good justification to not vote, especially since there are third-party candidates to choose from as well.  Though I may not agree with either of the two major candidates, c*****hoosing not to vote says that I am content with the way in which the government is currently run, or at least content enough that I do not wish to see it changed.***"" This is more of the stance I would take on the situation.  I personally have not done enough research on my own to feel comfortable with arguing one major candidate over the other, and that's on me.  Even still, I felt it important to cast a vote, and I did so.

The primary distinction between these two arguments is this: the first says that the implications of not voting are that a person disagrees with both major candidates, and thus are staying neutral.  The second says that the implications of not voting are that, even if a person disagrees with both candidates, he/she is accepting enough of the incumbent candidate's stances; that doesn't necessarily mean they support the candidate in question, but they don't see a need to change how the government is currently run.

To clarify again, I'm not asking about whether or not we should vote, and I'm not asking about whether or not it is acceptable to vote for one of the two major candidates simply because we dislike the other more; **I just want to know what choosing not to vote should imply to an outsider's perspective.**  My personal perspective is on the second point, though I would be interested in seeing a defense for the first, or even an entirely separate, stance on this topic.",jngf14,I guess in your friend’s defence one of the principle reasons for not voting is that voting reinforces the mandate of the winning party/candidate,gb1b88v,1.6

Estate Agents/Realtors are a cancer on society that should be expunged.,"***Key Finding from this CMV: Buying a house in the United States appears to be a far more straightforward experience, and realtors seem to actually have some professionalism and knowledge of both the property and the legal necessities surrounding the purchase of a property. Estate Agents in the UK - not so much.***

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am on my third house purchasing experience in five years, and I have yet to find a half-competent estate agent (EA) (realtor in the US). They really are a scourge and cancer on what could be a civilised and transparent process.  For what it is worth, I am based in the UK. Here are my arguments:

1. Estate agents are the proto-typical middle man. They act as go-betweens, talking to buyer and seller, acting only often to relay messages such as when a viewing would be appropriate, or an offer is being made. This has the following problems. **A:** *The likelihood of misunderstandings/missed messages is increased by 100%*. Between phone calls and emails, the chance of cock-up is doubled with EA's involved. **B:** Neither the buyer nor seller can communicate with each other, meaning that the middle man *has undue power over the transaction*. I will come to this later, but, I cannot be certain that my offer is even being presented to the seller in a manner that suits my interests - I have to rely on the ability of the EA to represent me correctly.
2. EAs add no value to the transaction. **A** *EA hold no liability on the accuracy of the information presented - that is up to the seller and the buyer.* Most middle men add value and expertise. Not EAs. Additional fact-checking and structural surveys are conducted by other qualified agents. Estate agents do nothing there. If a seller provides incorrect information, the buyer is responsible for verification, not the EA.  **B** *Most estate agents advertise your property poorly, with material produced by the seller, through third-parties who publish their content.* If you have sold a house, you'll know you basically write the advert yourself. You write the rooms are airy, and how many bathrooms you have, and that the garden faces south. Some joker, hired by the EA takes the pictures or you do this yourself also. Estate agents then Ctrl +C Ctrl + V this content into aggregators, like [rightmove.com](https://rightmove.com), who host that content. **C** *Even when being shown the property to sellers, many estate agents want you to be available on the property to answer questions.* When selling the property, many estate agents either want you on-site or nearby so you can answer seller questions. You can't just swan off and put your feet up, so you are not saving time or effort by having them do it (poorly) for you.
3. Estate Agents have perverse incentives. **A** *Estate Agents what to sell your house for the highest price as possible.* Estate Agents normally take a % of your house sale value. If the house is worth £100,000, they want you to sell it for £110,000 and advertise it for £120,000. This has the effect of inflating house prices and creating the pointless game of having ridiculous asking prices for homes in estate agent windows. This is great if you are only interested in getting the highest price for your property BUT **B** *Time is money.* Many estate agents work on the premise that it costs them nothing if a house is on the market for twice as long as it could be - as long as it sells at a higher price. If you want to sell it quick (*as most people in the market*), you'll have to advertise at a reasonable price. Reasonable price = lower % cut for them = lower customer service for you. So estate agents lie to sellers that their house is worth more than it is, so they can get a bigger cut. This has the problem of slowing down the entire property market.
4. They are almost universally incompetent at their job. **A** *If they had an intrinsic worth, agents wouldn't be so shit.* I have had estate agents get the wrong days, wrong houses, wrong keys. I have had calls from estate agents telling me my offer has been accepted when I haven't made one. They're 'just around the corner' and yet 40 minutes late. Most don't know any details about the house they are selling other than what I can read on the web. I have had them outright lie to me, telling me incorrect property lines and rights of way in order to get homes to seem more attractive. They lie to me telling me that the seller is aware of my offer, only to be then told by the seller that they had no idea. ***If Estate Agents had a societal benefit, we would all revolt against their incompetence. But they are basically useless, we all know they are inept, they know they are parasites, and so we dance a merry dance with these wastes of skin for no obvious reason.***

Change my view.",d53hua,"I can tell you for sure that your #3 is not accurate.

They generally are not working as hard for the seller as they are for the buyer, so they don't give a shit if you sell the house for 110k rather than 100k. The amount they will get is tiny between the two numbers.

They want to sell houses immediately and right now, so they try to work for the buyer to get that thing sold right now, so they can move on to the next sale. 

They make far more money when they sell 6 houses in 1 month than 5 houses even if those 5 houses are a few thousand dollars more on the final price.",f0jvr26,2.75
Canceling/subsidizing any amount of student loan debt shouldn't be considered until a legislation is put out to minimize the reasons debt is skyrocketing in the first place.,"In light of the U.S. considering canceling student loan debt with President Biden pushing $10k and Democrats pushing $50k, the focus seems to be the value rather than how to stop the next generation from digging that hole. Background, joined military, got school payed for etc. I'm borderline okay with my taxes going out so others won't have to be as worried with that crippling debt due to their choices. I'd be much more okay with the previous statement if I knew I had to never do it again cause there's laws in place. 

Also before the college should be free comments come out, yes I know and understand, I just want to work on this step before we take huge ones.

Edit 1: thanks for expressing student loan debt doesn't need to happen at all. I respect your opinion, numerous chat requests, and views. I do believe that's another conversation to be had that's different from this one.

Edit 2: I've realized through my own incompetence, it came off as Let's not do A until we do B. I should have iterated it better to be lets not do A without doing B together so B become an afterthought/impossibility afterwards.

Edit 3: Thank you all for your posts. I haven't had much time to respond to everyone but rest assured I've read most of it. If I didn't reply to it, there's a great chance that I responded to the reasoning earlier in one of the replies. To those who had nothing constructive for this post besides that they worked their ass off and people can get fucked if they can't do the same, thanks for your input. We just had fundamentally different views, and once you can recognize that it doesn't have to cause unnecessary negativity or belittling then I'd be more than happy to have the convos with you. Until then, I hope you vote for the changes you want to see! 

Also will somebody tell me how to do triangle delta on mobile?",m4g7jb,"I don't think you are framing this quite right. One of the arguments for Federal student loan debt cancellation is that it will have an economic impact. Okay, but we just passed a $1.9 trillion stimulus. So is still more ""stimulus"" necessary? Most forecasters are predicting 6%+ GDP growth.

And why $50,000, and who gets it? The majority of debt is held by people with graduate degrees, because the government caps student loan debt for undergrads. Undergrad debt loads tend to be closer to somewhere in the $20-30K range. Very few people have debt in excess of $100,000 and those tend to be high earners (people with PhDs or doctors/dentists/etc.) or people with higher earnings potential. So a $50,000 debt jubilee will clearly benefit higher income earners more than it will lower-income earners.

What will higher income earners do with the money they would have repaid loans with? Probably stick it in the bank, where there is far less economic benefit effect. The government would do better shoring up assistance to those with low incomes or spending money on workforce development, health care provision, etc.

What needs to be asked, and what a lot of people are not asking, is the **borrower's ability to repay the debt**. $200K of student loan debt sounds like a lot if you're a bartender, it is not much if you are a cardiologist. This is where if you look at the statistics, undergrads with higher debt tend to have gone to for-profit schools. They will also probably have a harder time finding jobs because these schools aren't exactly the highest quality.

So if you want to ""cancel"" 50K of education debt because it is crushing them and they have no way to repay it, by all means, do so. But don't do it across the board without looking at the person's income over a decent period (like 5-10 years) and their financial position. And don't act like it is going to have this massive benefit on addressing inequality, because by definition if you have a college degree statistically you are going to make more money than a HS grad. So what this is is a massive giveaway to the middle class, not some kind of magical anti-poverty program. Particularly so since it only benefits people in the current generation and doesn't change anything for future college students.

The left-leaning Brookings Foundation has a very good [analysis](https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/votervital/who-owes-all-that-student-debt-and-whod-benefit-if-it-were-forgiven/) of this. Sure enough, the major proposals from early 2020, from the Democratic progressive wing, benefit the upper middle class -- people with high earnings potential or incomes. The middle class doesn't need another subsidy -- not when there are parts of the country with no running water.",gquoqas,4.0

and if this only goes for non-venomous snakes, like pythons,boas and anacondas, bite dont happen often and are easy to prevent/tame. like for instance, If a snake mistakes you for food, they will bite you and curl around your hand then let go when realizing your not food, this might happen if you touch another animal and dont wash your hands before touching your snake.

the second type of bite is when is when they are scared and/or defensive they might dart in to scare you and not bite at all or give you a small bite and let go immediatly almost like a bitch-slap telling you to screw off.

If a snake has harmed you or a family/friend in anyway then yeah thats a good reason to not like them but its also biased,so dont come in here with that shit

Ted Kaczynski should be released from prison,"Ted Kaczynski is 78 years old at that point, and I really don't see how he could be a threat to society anymore so long as the government or a trusted family member can keep an eye on him so he doesn't get into more trouble in the future.

The way I see it, Ted has served his time and deserves to be able to live out his final years as a free man. Continuing to incarcerate him after all this time is cruel, unnecessary, and a waste of our resources that could be going to much better and more important causes.",i10b3h,"If the sole reason why he should be released is that he’s old and is no longer a threat, why does your post specify Ted Kaczynski and not all 78-year old prisoners?",fztsjfj,1.8
"While Gatekeeping is dumb and rude, so is saying you like something when you know little to nothing about it.","Nobody likes a gatekeeper, right? People can like whatever they want, with whatever level of involvement they choose. It's stupid to tell someone they ""aren't allowed"" to like something because they don't know much about it. However, I also think that it is stupid, and rude, to say that you really like something when you don't know much about it. I'm picking on a very specific kind of person here so I'll give a detailed example.

Let's say you're a huge Pink Floyd fan. You go out and happen to meet someone with a Pink Floyd, Dark Side of the Moon(of course), shirt on, you say, ""hey, cool shirt, I like Pink Floyd too!"" They reply, ""thanks, they're my favorite band! I really love all their songs."" Awesome what a cool person you just met, and they seem well versed, so you inquire further, ""what's your favorite song? Mine is Time."" They look a little confused, ""I haven't heard that one, I really like the one about school."" Oh no, you think to yourself, I've been duped, ""you haven't heard Time? But you're wearing- Uh, so you like The Wall then?"" Again, they're confused, ""the wall? what- I like the one where they go 'WE DONT NEED NO-'"" You cut them off, ""yeah, I, uh know the song. I thought you said they were your favorite band?"" He's immediately offended, ""Oh just cause I don't know every song they can't be my favorite?"" You defend yourself, ""**no I just thought you would know more**.""

And that is my point. It is unfair and dishonest to the person you are speaking to for you to claim you love/favorite/whatever something that you know little to nothing about. 

My proposed solution is just for people to be honest. If you like something but don't know much about it, then say that.

Some clarifiers: If someone knows a lot about the music a band makes/made, ie their songs and albums, but nothing about the band members, they are exempt from my ire. Same goes for films and whatever else people gatekeep in a similar way. Esoteric knowledge is irrelevant, unless I guess its also the main topic. I'd also clarify that I am not putting the blame on any individual here, rather I think that it is our toxic society's fault that people feel the need to lie about mundane things in such ways. Similarly, it is not dishonest because you don't *actually* love Pink Floyd or w/e, it's dishonest because when you say you love something, at least in American society, that usually denotes a deeper understanding/familiarization of/with it.",khg04c,"I don't think there's an issue with liking something, whether you know it or not.

But in comparison to what there is still to learn, even for him, he knows next to nothing. Putting made-up numbers on it, say I know ""10"". He knows ""10.000.000"". But there is like ""10^100"" to know. So you can always say that nobody ""knows"" anything. And then, according to your proposal, nobody would ever be entitled to say that they like anything. That would be ludicrous.",ggongrb,4.25
Generational demographic cohort classifications are not universally applicable.,"Generation classifications such as Millennials, Boomers etc are based on over simplified American-centric demographic experiences. 
Such classifications may loosely apply to certain populations around the world who might have had a more globalised upbringing, but by no means take into the experiences of the global population.
For example. A 25 year old South Asian may or may not fit into the definition of a Millennial depending on where they live, global exposure&amp; economic class. 

Even within the US, it is unlikely that all 25 year olds display popularly defined millennial characteristics.

People who actively decline to donate organs should be declined organ donations themselves,"I see how this is a morally problematic stance.
I am generally not for “what goes around comes around” approaches, but in my view, organ donations are literally a matter of life issue and arise above just the individual.
It’s more than just being a little egoistic if you purposefully decline to save other people’s lives.
If you actively, (which includes being over 18 and mentally stable) decline to donate your organs than I personally think it is fair to not grant you such a valuable gift. 
On the other side such a rule could push people to rethink their stance and would probably have an immensely positive effect on the number of organ donors.

The only two problems I see with this is that in reality it will be tough to draw such a border between those who “actively” decline organs and those who might be pressured by their environment or aren’t stable etc. and that such a restriction could lead to a sort of organ elitism by people then demand that we should also not give organs to addicts, obese people etc..

As often religious believes are a reason for not wanting to donate, I think that a lot of those believes also include not wanting to receive strangers organs anyways.

I am really interested to hear your thoughts on this. CMV!


Edit: This has been an exciting read so far! As some things keep on being brought up:

A) this is a thought experiment, I’m not in a position to enforce anything I’m here to challenge a viewpoint and that overall philosophical not bureaucratically.

B) This is about people actively opting out on donation, not people being unable to donor due to illness etc. at those are not active choices. 

C) I agree that the opt-out system is a great way to increase donations and I am very much for it’s implementation. If we wanna go down the rabbits whole of implementing the here proposed scenario it was actually what I had in mind, because in the opt-out scenario an active choice is the most obvious.

Adults invalidate children and teenagers feelings every day,"Adults dismiss children’s problems and emotions all the time. The reason: they compare their problems, their struggles and emotions to their own.

When a **teen** is heartbroken because of a failed relationship the usual interaction goes like this: *-I loved him. +What do you know about love? You're too young. You'll get over it, it was only a fling.* Like love can only be experienced by adults. You've been loving since you were a little baby. You love/loved your parents; by the time you’re a teen that’s a decade or so of feeling what love is. What caring for someone feels. This teen is hurt, maybe is the first time dealing with this kind of emotion, you should be glad for that and for the fact that he trust you enough to tell you his struggles. He doesn't know how to deal with his emotions and needs someone to listen to him.

Phrases such as *that’s not that bad, you are being ridiculous* or *don’t be so dramatic* are the worse. A teen may be anxious about an upcoming test, a party or sporting event and if they are catastrophizing the possible consequences their anxiety makes perfect sense. Listen to them and let them know that is ok to feel that way, that will them de-catastrophize, analyze the situation with a clear mind. It is important to help them understand their emotions are valid.

Being an adult, you probably have experienced similar situations throughout your life, you know that the days will get better, but THEY DON'T. They still have to acquired the tools to properly handle this overwhelming emotions and with your help they can do it. Most of the time you don't have to do anything but listen. They are not asking for you to fix the situation, just let them know their are not alone, that you're with them.

With **children** is the same. KidsAreFuckingStupid is the perfect example. You put your 3-4 years old plush in the washing machine and he starts crying because he thinks you're killing it. Instead of explaining to him that everything will be fine, that his friend (yes, friend) will not be damaged in any way (maybe tell him that he can hold his breath for hours, he will believe you) and that like with his clothes, it will only be cleaner; the parent took a picture to mock his child, HIS CHILD (or her, idk). **That had more than 49k people agreeing with it**. A 9 yeard old cries because his roblox account got hacked. Let's mock him, crying over a game, what a joke. **This one atm has over 37k people agreeing with it.**

THEY ARE KIDS, their whole life is filled with toys, games, eating, school and friends. They cry because of something important TO THEM. Remember when your whole world was finishing that game? winning that tournament at your school? watching that cartoon? This things are important to them. What do they honestly expect? To care about economics? Let them enjoy their childhood.

This is the same people that complaint about how their parents never made them feel listened or loved. **Let me break it to you: You are doing the same.**

It might not mean much to you, but to them it’s extremely important. You are failing to see the issue from THEIR perspective. Listen and help. This teaches them that it’s important to listen and care about other people’s issues.

Edit: To make it more clear, my point is that invalidating their feelings is wrong and that most adults do this every day with little things they do or say.",gvjonk,"I disagree.


For one thing, not all feelings are worth validation. Not as kids, not as adults. Validation in the essence is saying your feelings or youractions are appropriate/just for what’s going on. And for kids, most of the time it’s not.


Validating their feelings when they cry over spilled milk, will make them believe they should always cry over spilled milk. 


Also the definition of wrong is extremely personally defined. So do you mean like morally wrong? As if the adults doing it are evil? Or societally wrong? Like we should strive to constantly validate kids feelings?


If you mean wrong as it’s harmful to the kid, I would like to say, there’s no right way to parenting. Many kids growing up in abusive households, grow up with a drive that helps them succeed. Or many kids growing up in loving households, grow up being afraid of the world and thinking everyone is against them. Just because something will make a kid sad or frustrated, doesn’t mean it’s not good for them as a whole.


In conclusion though, personally I believe pampering a child with validation will make them grow up to be fragile. Their entire life they were in the right. Their entire life they lived feeling like everything they did was justified and valid. Once they step in to the real world, they’ll be crushed.",fsq7ty3,3.2
"Leaving people disconnected from the rest of the world is tragic, not beautiful","This is in response to a post that hit my front page today. Throughout the comments, people talk about how cool it is that these people behave in basically the same way as their Neolithic ancestors, and how they “chose” this life and it is beautiful in its own way.

What I think these redditors are neglecting is the fact that is not an informed choice. These islanders aren’t choosing some idyllic isolated life over the hustle and bustle of modern existence. They are choosing what they know over a scary unknown.

Meanwhile these islanders suffer all the lovely problems of the Stone Age, like enormous maternal mortality rates, children making it to adulthood less often than not, easily treatable problems likes appendicitis being death sentences. If the islanders actually understood their decision, would they make it as they do currently?

Edit: changes to my view so far:

The status quo remains because it’s very hard, if even possible, to change it. Problems like how to morally introduce modern society without tearing down what is already there and causing harm are difficult to solve and would require incredibly gradual solutions, no instant “hey guys here’s a smart phone” revelations.

It makes sense to divert funds from the police to social services,"Police are currently stretched too thin, being asked to respond to all types of calls that are well outside their areas of expertise. They don't want to respond to mental health calls, the people experiencing a mental health crisis don't want them to respond, and the people calling them often don't even want them to respond. But there often isn't a less violent alternative that's available.

I'm not advocating for abolishing the police. I think they still have a valid purpose of responding to violent calls, investigating crimes, etc. But a lot of their job duties would be better filled by people with greater expertise in those specific areas and don't actually require anyone to be armed.

I also think it makes sense to divert some of the money to preventative services that would provide mental health treatment, substance abuse treatment, housing security, etc.

There seems to be a lot of opposition to decreasing police budgets at all and I'm at a loss at to why. What am I missing here?

EDIT: I've had a lot of people say ""why would you take funds away from police if they're already stretched too thin"". While I  agree that the statement might be worded poorly, I'd encourage you to consider the second half of that sentence. I'm not suggesting that police budgets are stretched too thin, I'm suggesting they're being asked to do too much outside of their area of expertise.

**EDIT 2:  OK, thank you everyone for your responses! At this point I am going to stop responding. We had some good discussion and a couple of people were even kind enough to provide me with actual studies on this subject. But it seems like the more this thread has gained popularity the more the comments have become low effort and/or hostile.** ",kdznjn,"Its not a bad idea to have front line workers who are trained in de-escalation/conflict resolution/etc. I also don't think its a great idea for workers in a police-like culture to be doing this. Most cops I know would be out of their depth in this area.

However, I think its going to cost more overall, not less and police unions will resist any change or any attempt to add oversight. The common thought is that 'people who don't do this job, don't understand this job,' which is mostly accurate.

Its a tough issue. I think the best thing we can do is crack down on fraud in police departments. That same 'protect our own' mentality leads to police covering bad actors. There was a cop in Seattle who put more hours of overtime on his timesheet than existed in the entire year. Guy pulled in something like 500k, iirc. That shit needs to stop. So, someone needs to stop police from taking advantage of taxpayers in that fashion, for sure. If police don't want civilian oversight boards, they need to understand this and start taking care of their own house.

I think a MFA/universal healthcare strategy could help with this. We can reduce our healthcare budget by reforming the system we currently use. What our current healthcare system does is allow insurance companies/pharma companies/etc to extract over the top amounts of money from it. Its not designed to help people in an efficient manner. I know, this is my business, so many loopholes and so much unnecessary spending to pad the pocketbooks of big businesses. There are a million ways to reduce healthcare spending that we need to pursue.

And since we're going to have a massive increase in at home care as our population ages, we can create a separate service to provide on-call 'civilian' employees who can manage some of the calls police aren't adequately trained to deal with, and honestly, we just don't want them to deal with. The kind of person who chooses to become a cop is very different from the kind of person who chooses to become a social worker (in the aggregate, not saying this about individual people). Thats a good thing, different people are better at different work, but we should put people in positions where they can be most effective.

New York City is a terrible place to live.,"
To quote my favorite depressed horse ""New York is a great city to live in for 6 months and not a minute longer and only if you're insanely wealthy""

I just can't hide my disappointment anymore. I grew up with movies and books that glamorize the city and people who live there talking on and on about it and showing it as the center of the universe... but after having live there for almost a year I just want to say are you kidding me?!?

 Sure it is a fine city,Central Park is pretty impressive and the city looks wonderful in Christmas time (fyi so does every other city in the world). And the ever famous Times Square is like the visual equivalent of people shouting at you; GIVE ME YOUR MONEY! Buy this and this and that too and you will be happy!Just consume!"" So nauseating!

You always have to wait long lines in front of every good club and night life is very restricted to whatever is “popular” at the time and seems like all the clubs are copying each other (as a counter example there is a nude night club in Amsterdam and don’t let me get started on the nightlife in Berlin) and charging waaay to much and people are taking more photos than they are dancing.

 At the end of the day city is just chaotic and crowded and frustrating and smells weird (urine?) and full of over overpriced cafes and shops that keeps opening and closing and creates unnecessary hype and people wait in looong lines for the weirdest stuff (rainbow bagel...really?) while on the other side of the city people eat whole meals at the price of 1 rainbow bagel,the difference between economic groups is terrifying and tragic. 

 Public transportation is a lifesaver when the traffic literally stops (unless you have a helicopter to fly over and appreciate the skyscrapers-you know like in the movies) but you always know your train will be late and subway system's poor infrastructure always makes you feel on edge aand you guessed it,it smells funny too! And weirdest things happen and people just shrug and SMILE and say “Welcome to New York” like a homeless guy masturbating in the subway is “so NYC” and it is somewhat okay??! What?? It is so disturbing and wrong and it was like the least weird thing that happened to me on subway...

Homeless people are everywhere (to be clear they are not the problem but victims of a much bigger problem) and people walk pass them like its nothing like they are fixed figures on the streets which breaks my heart. 

And on top of that people are mostly stressed and over worked and always running somewhere... and yes every business center in every city looks hectic during rush hour but have those people ever been to Vienna? Barcelona? Amsterdam? Montreal? Melbourne?

People are more peaceful in there,take long lunches and they don’t live to work and in general more friendly and happy-looking.

I am so tired of hearing people say “New York City is the best in the world” Ummm no.

All of those cities I mentioned are much nicer  and healthier to live in than NYC and I never heard them brag about “being the best in the world” or mentioning in every movie they made how NYC is the center of the universe.

First off, when I hear whisky tasters describe “band-aids, socks, acetone, iodine, burnt rubber, electrical tape, etc) when they taste a whisky and they proclaim its delicious, I cannot fathom how any of those things would be desirable.

Software updates on mobile aren't that important,"Hello, I'm back with another CMV regarding technology, this time I wanna discuss with you guys the matter of software updates.

When I lurk over at r/android and other technology sites I find everyone to be complaining about Android's seemingly lackluster software support, and I want to challenge this fact by saying software updates aren't that great. here's why:

1. They are known for breaking phones. The Galaxy A70 is known for bricking itself for no reason after updating to Android 10. The Galaxy M20 suffers of the same problem. Some iPhones started showing Error 53 after iOS updates. Xiaomi Mi A3 keeps getting bugs after bugs and Xiaomi just pulled the Android 10 update for the third time. 

2. They are known for slowing down phones. Apple and Samsung were fined millions in Europe for updating their devices after customers started to complain their phone is slower than before without being announced. I know some iPhone users who refuse to update to the latest iOS version purely because they fear their phone being slowed down over time.

3. Facebook and Instagram, and Tinder, will run just fine on Android 6 and 7. Most people use their phones to scroll on social media. You don't need the April security patch for that. iOS 11 and 12 are also supported iirc. 

4. Software updates just bring features that stop being useful after five minutes of trying them out, with rare exceptions. 

5. Most people honestly don't care. They don't know which Android or iOS version they run on their phone without looking in the settings menu. 

I believe software updates have their place, but mostly in the PC environment, where they do actually allow you to run recent apps in a more optimized way, where you have the option to update drivers and Windows 10 runs as a service (for this reason I also appreciate Arch Linux and Manjaro, for their rolling release model).

I also generally refer to OS system upgrades. Security patches are still being released for older versions (since Nougat I believe) and individual apps are still being updated for older versions directly from the manufacturer through Google Play.

But on mobile honestly nobody cares. CMV.",g3slbq,"The problem is updates can have all sorts of things in them from very basic changes to massive changes.

There could be a bug in your OS that is sucking up massive amounts of resources that's been patched out. You won't ever see those benefits if you don't update.

There might be some fundamental flaw to the OS's security that everyone and their mother is exploiting.

Unless the people updating the OS are very open about what they're doing, and you take the time to consume that information. You're almost always better off updating as soon as you have any perceived problem that might or might not be fixed by an update. 

But you won't see security problems....That is the number 1 reason to update assuming you do anything you care about keeping private/in your control on your phone. Which 99%+ probably do",fnte1v3,3.75
American football is the worst spectator sport,"I'm not American, so it's hard to look inwards at the most capitalist country on Earth from outside that culture to fully appreciate the positives of the sport. I do actually appreciate the tactical aspect of the game, that is its crowning glory, but so much gets in the way of it that I just can't understand how it can be enjoyed.

My argument comes down, essentially, to this fact:

**In an average game lasting over 3 hours, the ball is in play for only 11 minutes on average.**

That is barely a sport. That's not even a quick game in your back garden.

I'm not looking for the argument that the rest of the time is well spent drinking, or hanging with friends, where is the merit to a sport with so little gameplay.

I appreciate the answer may be entirely down to the unique American culture, but would love to be convinced otherwise.",jhtdzf,"I think football is an extremely enjoyable game to watch. More enjoyable than any other sport. Just because the ball isn't in play, it doesn't mean nothing is happening. The way the teams line up affects what the drive will look like. Whether you choose to stop the clock to preserve time for yourself or run it to burn away the opponent's resources is an important tactical decision. It's a game of strategy, tactics, and execution and no two plays are quite the same.

Compare this to European football where it's an hour and a half of the ball moving to the left... and to the right... and to the left... and no one scoring and basically nothing important happening for the majority of the game. YAAAAWN. I'll watch the last 5 minutes and skip the rest. 

And then there's the fact that every *game* matters. It's hard to get interested in a sports game with no stakes. In a game like baseball you can lose like 30 games and still qualify for the series. What's the point of playing a game if winning or losing literally doesn't matter? Even in the world series, you need to win like 5 times. I'll skip all the filler games and wait until the ones that matter happens. 

In summary, football is such an exciting game, because every individual play and action affects the entire season.",ga293hg,3.6666666666666665
Intermittent fasting is good for you if you're planning on losing weight - - stop shaming me for skipping breakfast,"IMPORTANT EDIT: CMV IF YOU BELIEVE NOT EATING BREAKFAST CAN HARM MY BODY

Firstly, this post is for people who do not have any eating disorders or other health problems.

About me:-
I have my first meal of the day around 12:00 or 13:00. I usually have a fruit or something after my meal not because I'm hungry but just because I crave sweet and I'm usually satisfied with it. My 2nd and last meal is around 19:00. At times I drink green tea at night, not because I'm hungry but because I'm bored and like going to the kitchen often. I have a black coffee every morning. I like to go for 4-5km walks. 
I do not have any hunger attacks outside of my eating window. I am very comfortable - physically and mentally. 

The first place where people tend to go wrong when trying to lose weight is that they forget to realize that it is the lifestyle which matters more than determination to lose weight. People work extremely hard to lose 30lbs or whatever in 3 months but have difficulties in maintaining it for long. I belong to this group of people.

It is true that you need xyz (depending on your gender, current weight) calories to continue with your daily brain &amp; body functioning. But it is not true that you need to split the calories in pqr number of meals. You can have them within a specified time window. 

When you're only eating for 8hrs or 10hrs a day, it is usually difficult to overeat. Also since you know that you'll be fasting for the rest of the day, you try to choose the best foods for you which can keep you full for longer (like protein, fiber) without killing your cravings for small portions of your favorite foods. 

Apart from that, there are proven benefits for your brain and body. Some of the oversimplified benefits are as follows :-

1. Insulin levels are in control. 

2. Human growth hormone levels are high. 

3. A nobel prize was awarded to a scientist researching autophagy (self body repair) which is simulated by fasting. 

4. Helps in reducing the visceral fat. 

5. Reduces inflammation in the body. 

6. Increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor.

"Universities should, in some cases, be held responsible if a student is unable to pay back federal student loan debt accrued at their institution","Universities have no incentive to cut costs as the federal student loans program will more or less cut any student a check and hold them personally responsible for paying the loan back. In many cases frivolous spending such as new buildings, sports stadiums, or hiring unnecessary admin are all done at the cost of students who have had no say in the decision making process. Example, a university builds a new football field for millions of dollars which the Art History students will never use, yet the Art History students' tuition go to the field. Furthermore, universities don't provide realistic job training or counselling to students despite forcing them to bury themselves in debt to attend, setting these students up to fail.

Therefore, if universities are held accountable for their ballooning tuition fees or students they have failed, then there would be incentive to lower their tuition.

Note: I define ""a student they have failed"" as a student with a good academic track record, has tried and failed to enter into a career or academic program either directly related to or adjacent their major, and with a significant amount of debt. I would define the university's failure as a failure to provide adequate education relative to price, a failure to provide adequate career training and preparation, and a failure of the university to charge a reasonable tuition. I imagine this would be judged on a case by case basis.",e5d7wt,"Im not sure abt that.. 

It's just a trade. If I tell you: I give you this envelop and you pay me 20k, and you agree to this trade, then I can do whatever I want with the 20k. Same with universities actually.

You accept to pay the tuition, while going in debt, but in return you'll get knowledge. It's your own responsibility. Don't push it to others, first look at yourself. 

Don't go into debt if you can't afford it. And ofcourse, don't buy envelops for 20k :)

People who can vote but choose not to should not be considered when making policy to listening to grievances.,"If you are not a citizen, or under 18 this does not apply to you. I am talking about eligible voters specifically.

I don't want to hear about ""Its too hard because of voter suppression"" *I drove from Maryland to Michigan an 8 hour drive to vote because my mail in ballot was never delivered, and then I drove back another 8 hour drive over 2 days because I decided to make sure I would have a choice in how this country is going to be run. I'm a minority also if someone wants to try and make an angle* So save the excuses.

People fought and died for your right to vote. When this country was founded only 6% of the population was eligible to vote. It took till 1865 for Minority men to get the vote and then about a decade after 100 years to federally protect it.

It took till 1920 for women to get the right to vote and it took 18-21 year olds being drafted into war to get the vote for 18 years and older in the 70s. 

If you want change you need to go out and vote because politicians only care about those who vote and if everyone who complains on social media went out and voted even when their favorite was not on the ballot we would be in a much better place right not.

Morality is subjective,"I will lay down the case through a few axioms. Change my mind by disproving the axiom, or demonstrating that I applied it incorrectly.

     1) An individual can never be held morally accountable for trying to survive.

A lion is an obligate carnivore. This means it is necessary for a lion to kill prey for food. A lion has no capacity to eat anything else, and therefore it's only real choices are kill or starve to death. It should not be blamed for this, it did not choose its condition.

If an attacker comes at you with a knife, and you defend yourself with a gun, you can not be blamed for self defense. A desperate action to defend one's self under threat of danger should not be considered immoral.

**
A possible place this breaks down is whether it's immoral to act in self defense in a situation you caused. For example, a man on death row might not be justified killing his guards to try to escape. Since the criminal is on death row for acting immorally in the first place, I will consider ""self defense"" against reasonable punishment not justified. There's grey area on how immoral the offending act has to be, but that just points to more subjectivity.

     2) Different individuals have different survival conditions.

It is morally okay for a starving child to steal a loaf of bread to eat if he's starving. It is not morally okay for me to steal a loaf of bread.

Lions need to kill to eat, a rabbit does not. It's morally okay for a lion to kill a gazelle, but not for a rabbit to kill a gazelle.

     3) Morality is concerned with the space in between the survival conditions.

It's not okay for a starving child to steal a loaf of bread and an xbox. The bread was necessary for survival, the xbox was not.

It's not morally acceptable for a lion to kill a gazelle for fun, with no intentions of eating it.

&amp;nbsp;

Thus, morality is different depending on your circumstances. Each individual you come across is bound by different moral rules as they have different conditions to survival from you.

A poor person barely making ends meet has more moral leeway in their choice of profession than a rich man, because the rich man has more opportunities to meet their survival conditions. A general is more morally complicit in war than a private because the general is calling the shots from relative safety while the private is in a combat situation.",e2akkd,"An individual can  be expected to attempt survival via immortality, either literally, via genetic lineage, or via some sort of cultural/intellectual/social legacy.  Barring literal physical immortality, there is a likely instinct for self-sacrifice which can take precedence to further any of those attempts, and it has likely proved adaptive for the species. In some people, this adaptive instinct also likely tragically misfires.  This is less a question of what is right or what is good, than a question of what is practical, and what is selected for over the aeons.

Barring any sort of magical personal immortality, both other survival conditions require the support of other well-adapted humans.  In other words, cooperation is an obligatory precondition of survival. One could consider compelling the obedience of others via tyranny, however this does not appear to be sustainable or adaptive. Cooperation by some type of explicit or tacit agreement appears to be how it’s done.

Morality simply codifies the norms of effective cooperation.",f8uiruy,3.25
None of the Independent or 3rd Party Candidates Running for President will have a Significant Impact,"Seemed appropriate to post this as Reddit is still abuzz about Kanye West (rapper, producer, iconoclast, bipolar individual) announcing his ""run"" for president. I think Redditors are making this a much bigger deal than it actually is. I'd be surprised if Kanye gets over 100k votes across the country (probably mostly if not entirely from write-ins considering he's already missed several filing deadlines).   
But it's not just Kanye. Jo Jorgensen and Howie Hawkins (libertarian and green candidates respectively) are also probably over-represented on Reddit. This article from Forbes claims polls have Jorgensen at about 1% and Hawkins at a statistical 0%. This is far behind Jill Stein and Gary Johnson in 2016 (neither of which won a single electoral vote). [Forbes on current Polls](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2020/06/15/new-polls-show-trump-down-by-double-digits-as-gop-officials-insist-polls-are-meaningless/)
In my opinion, this election does not leave room for a third candidate to make significant in-roads. Trump is more disliked than ever, and Joe Biden is not as objectionable to most people as Hillary Clinton was. In 2016 people were very skeptical that Trump could win. That skepticism is gone, and will have an effect in who people decide to vote for. Hillary had trouble getting to the center in 2016 (although her platform was quite centrist) because she didn't have a strong left to differentiate herself from (Bernie notwithstanding). There is a much more significant left movement in America right now and Biden has been effectively staying in the middle. Biden also did better than Hillary in head-to-head matchups with Bernie, which (dynamics of the race aside) indicates that the party might be more united than it was in 2016 (despite what Twitter might tell you).   
While the left is definitely stronger and louder than 2016, the majority of the country seems to want some sort of ""return to normal"". While Trump's base probably embraces his divisiveness (or claims he isn't divisive), many who voted for him in 2016 would prefer to have someone less inflammatory in charge. 62 million people voted Trump in 2016. It's a mistake to view these people as a monolith. Some voted for Trump because they genuinely think he's awesome, but more probably voted for him as a ""lesser of two evils"".   
All of this contributes to giving people less incentives to vote for a ""third-way"" or protest candidate and more incentive to either vote for Biden or Trump. 

Tl;dr 2020 is not going to be a good year for independent/third party candidates. Biden will do better with moderates/independents than Hillary did because people want a ""return to normal"".",hlr1gl,"Kanye West has the potential to capture a fair chunk of the black vote, which would disproportionately hurt Biden.

Asexual people are not a marginalized class of people,"This distinction is not an arbitrary one for me. I define a marginalized class by their political exclusion, the severity of violence enacted against them, and the material and economic inequality they face. There is no threat of violence against asexual people in the way there is a threat of violence against gay, lesbian, transgender or any other LGBT+ identification. Asexual people are not kicked out of their homes. Asexual people are not killed by homophobes. Asexual people are not castrated by doctors like intersex people are. Asexual people are not refused job opportunities or upward momentum in their careers. Any instance of I have seen of asexual person claiming they are oppressed I would not see as different from normal bullying, which is nonetheless wrong, but distinct from a systemic exclusion. As a consequence, I also believe that asexual people claiming the experience of oppression, muddies our understanding of what oppression means since it can just mean ""getting made fun of for being different is oppression"" rather than oppression being understood for what it really is: a persistent systemic violence against a powerless class of people.

At least as far as I understand, this is my position as of now, and am open to change. I once felt that asexual people claiming that you can love having sex and be asexual also didn't make sense, but I was convinced otherwise. I hope this doesn't sound too soap-boxy, but I want to explain my position clearly, and not just pretend my position is neutral, but explain the stakes for defining things this way.

With that in mind, seems there's two ways I would change my mind. Show my definitions are flawed (this might be harder) or convince me asexual people fit in the definition I have provided.",ulecmw,"You have a very narrow definition of what marginalized oppression can be. There are plenty of asexual people who are ""oppressed"" by virtue of having their choices to be single for whatever reason they choose the trivialized and treated as something wildly unnatural or ridiculous that they would even be considering not going out and having sex like everyone else.

Just because nobody is out here lynching aces doesn't mean that it is OK the little amount of trivialization and disrespect they receive. I'm sure there are plenty of worse things going on for much more high profile sexual and gender identities (i say as a bisexual nonbinary), but we still need to pay attention to the low-profile ones as well. We can't rank any of them as more or less important just because some of them have it worse than others.",i8angrr,3.4
The Current ABS Regulations for Motorcycles Are Objectively Unsafe,"The current ABS regulations for motorcycles have the following 2 criteria. based on UN Global Technical Regulation #3 and National Conventions, which means that motorcycle ABS are inherently unsafe for riders:

1. Switchable ABS resets on every ignition cycle
2. ABS is not switchable while the vehicle is in motion
3. ABS is tested only on clean and level surface

Why is this unsafe for riders?

* On un-paved surfaces or surfaces with very low PBC (peak breaking co-efficient), ABS causes a longer stopping distance. So a rider wants ABS off on unpaved surfaces. It is not always the case that riders can safely stop when moving onto surfaces where ABS should be off. Sometimes it's just a stretch of the same, normally paved, road one has been on. Driving down a narrow farm road, in the spring for instance, it's common to find a long stretch of road covered in dirt. **Riders should always be able to actively select the best braking operation option** even when the vehicle is in motion. 
* If a rider lives or is riding where ABS is not wanted, having to remember to turn it off on every ignition cycle for maximum safety is asking for operator error. It is far better to rely on the operator to know when they want to change the setting than to presume the setting should be changed. **Limiting operator error starts by not having the bike change operator selected settings without being asked to do so.** 
* When ABS is not required to be tested on low PBC unlevel, gravel, sandy, or otherwise not clean surfaces, **flawed bike engineering will not be uncovered**. This is particularly true for bikes in the Adventure category that should be presumed to be doing at least some off-road riding.",u1e5ke,So how is locking up the wheels safer?  It’s the rider’s responsibility to ride at a safe distance and speed allowing for stopping distance or at least avoidance of an obstacle.  Locking up the brakes and losing rolling friction is worse because it takes far more control away from the rider than ABS could.,i4bqflw,3.0
"You Need to Calm Down"" is tone-deaf and naive","I recognize that this song came out a while ago, but I'm still a bit perplexed about its largely positive reception. 

In the song, she basically opens with complaining about her haters on Twitter. Standard T-Swift territory there. She tells them that they need to calm down and let her live her life. 

Next, she talks about homophobia and her response is the same: calm down and let them live their lives. 

By having the same response to these different issues and putting them in parallel positions in verses of the same song, it sounds like she's saying that these are basically the same issue and they need the same response. It seems a little naive to think that homophobia is similar to having people tweet meanly about you. Like she could close her computer and escape the twitter trolls, but a gay kid with a homophobic family has to live a reality of either hiding who they are or facing hatred from those who are supposed to love them.

Another problem I see is the trivializing of homophobes by depicting them as trailer park people with bad teeth and poor spelling. By saying that the only people who hate gay people are poor and uneducated, it makes it seem that homophobia is a petty issue that cannot possibly affect real lives but like, look at Mike Pence. He definitely is a homophobe in a position of power. If only the trailer-dwelling people who could hardly make a protest sign hated me for being gay, my life would be WAAAY easier. But that isn't the case.

I am not arguing that this was meant maliciously. I'm just saying that I think that the song is out of touch with reality.",d2qmjz,"I don’t want to convince you that your interpretation of the song isn’t valid, but I will say that as another gay guy I didn’t feel like the song trivialized my experience at all. I think that people need to calm down about a lot of things, but that doesn’t mean I consider them all the same severity. I occasionally mock homophobes, but that doesn’t mean I think they don’t have impact on people’s lives.",ezx29j9,2.75
Overt religious faith should disqualify a person from the Judiciary system in a society that claims to separate Church and State.,"I'm not suggesting that all judges need to be avowed atheists or agnostics, but merely suggesting that a clear fervent belief for following the scriptures is at odds with impartially fulfilling one's duties to the bench.

The laws of God and Man do not always see eye-to-eye, so a judge must not be too inclined towards fervent religious belief lest it impact their ability to separate personal beliefs from state-mandated laws.

While personal views certainly play a role in the nuance of judging cases on an individual basis, when those views are colored by the belief of God-given edicts and an afterlife in which people are punished accordingly for missteps, the desire to act in favor of those far more enduring 'laws' almost certainly impacts decisions (at least subconsciously) regarding the laws of the State.

In order to assure that State laws are upheld as reliably as possible, people who serve in the government as Judges should not be obviously beholden to a secondary code of laws that may come in conflict with the ones they are sworn to protect lest they be tempted to 'litigate from the bench'.",j7pgvm,"Are you suggesting there should be some sort of religious test to qualify for the judiciary?

As long as people are capable of judging according to the law, there should be no reason to disqualify. If they make a judgement that is contrary to the law because of religious bias then of course they should be disqualified, but this also goes for political bias and any other view that may be a factor.",g872bxz,2.75
Democracy and freedom contributed to the failure of handling the coronavirus.," At the start of the year when China was being the country with the most number of cases and the most draconian measures, I noticed that these measures were hard to implement in a democracy, and was afraid that when the time comes democracies won’t be able to handle the virus as well. Although, back then, I trusted democracies to be able to implement other suitable policies to deal the virus successfully. However, now we see that China seems to have one of the best responses, with only 100k cases in a country with billions of people, eradicated local transmissions in just 1-2 months, never had any second outbreaks, and life has already returned to normal; while many other countries, especially democracies, have millions of cases, with second or even third outbreaks. As much as I \*do not\* want to believe this, I am now starting to be very disappointed at the fact that many traits of democracies and emphasis of freedom directly caused the mishandling of the virus.

1 - Combating the virus requires the entire population (or a vast majority) to act in unison, such as wearing mask, faithfully reporting own cases, social distancing and following lockdown. It’s a game where you win by everyone doing the same thing, and if any minority \*doesn’t\* do it the entire game fails. However, democracies emphasize diversity of opinion, such as by means of freedom of assembly. Although this emphasis is generally good, it is bad at virus handling because now you always have a part of the population who doesn’t believe in the right measures to contain the virus. For example, many democracies have people protesting against mask use and lockdown measures, which causes more infections. And misinformation about the virus spread online without the government being able to remove them due to freedom of speech.

2 - Democracy and freedom emphasizes on the separation of power and the checks and balances, and for good reasons. However, these processes will almost definitely slow down decision making, leading to arguments and debates and delayed implementation. Such inefficiency will make it almost impossible to implement many policies China did, such as testing huge number of people when even a single case is detected, or to rapidly isolate all the sick people into a designated area, or to bring doctors from other province/state to help with the most infected areas. In short, even if democratic governments want to implement effective policies, they will meet roadblocks such as people disagreeing with them, and other debates, pushbacks, and slowness.

3 - It is true that many democracies such as South Korea and Taiwan were able to contain the virus like China, however they have a very small population (making decision making easier) and are seeing signs of second and third outbreaks as well. Besides, they are quite rare to have a majority of the population believing in the containment measures and following them (instead of doing large protests, for example), so I think they aren’t representative of what a typical democracy looks like when handling the virus.",n9i1mh,"I think it's important that we acknowledge that a global pandemic 100% counts as extenuating circumstances in which the leader of our country had the ability to dictate (for lack of a better word) safety precautions to protect his people, and deliberately chose not to. We had a leader that was validating all of the unsafe practices and ignoring the recommendations of global health leaders. If the leader of our country had not been in quite so much denial and acted without his pride in the favor of the people in his country I think we may have had some different results, including the possibility of more unified action, and the acceptance of a pause on separation of power for the greater good of the people. I see where you are coming from for sure, but democracy is not completely to blame here.",gxnxti6,3.0
Cultural appropriation is a western concept,"
I’m tired of seeing people getting mad/hating on people for wearing clothing of other cultures or even wearing hairstyles of other cultures like braids. All these people who claim that this is cultural appropriation are wrong. Cultural appropriation is taking a part of ones culture and either claiming it as your own or disrespecting. Getting braids in your hair when you’re not black and wearing a kimono when you’re not Japanese is okay you’re just appreciating aspects of another culture. I’m from Uganda (a country in east Africa) and when I lived there sometimes white people would come on vacation, they would where kanzu’s which are traditional dresses in our culture. Nobody got offended, nobody was mad we were happy to see someone else enjoying and taking part in our culture. I also saw this video on YouTube where this Japanese man was interviewing random people in japan and showed them pictures of people of other races wearing a kimono and asking for there opinions. They all said they were happy that there culture was being shared, no one got mad. When you go to non western countries everyone’s happy that you want to participate in there culture. 

I believe that cultural appropriation is now a western concept because of the fact that the only people who seen to get mad and offended are westerners. They twisted the meaning of cultural appropriation to basically being if you want to participate in a culture its appropriation. I think it’s bs.

Edit: Just rephrasing my statement a bit to reduce confusion. I think the westerners created a new definition of cultural appropriation and so in a way it kind of makes that version of it atleast, a ‘western concept’. 

Edit: I understand that I am only Ugandan so I really shouldn’t be speaking on others cultures and I apologize for that.

Edit: My view has changed a bit thank to these very insightful comments I understand now how  a person can be offended by someone taking part in there culture when those same people would hate on it and were racist towards its people. I now don’t think that we should force people to share their cultures if they not want to. The only part of this ‘new’ definition on cultural appropriation that I disagree with is when someone gets mad and someone for wearing cultural clothing at a cultural event. Ex how Adele got hated on for wearing Jamaican traditional clothing at a Caribbean festival. I think of this as appreciating. However I understand why people wearing these thing outside of a cultural event can see this as offensive. And they have the right to feel offended.

This was a fun topic to debate, thank you everyone for making very insightful comments! I have a lot to learn to grow. :)",lo3sg6,Actually I would argue it's an american concept. In europe sharing culture and trying things from other cultures is pretty normal and accepted,go49mqi,2.2
Working hard does not = more money in most* cases.,"Ive worked “low-skill” jobs at warehouses, fast food chains, etc and most recently obtained a solid paying job making around $30/hr as a collections specialist (might not be a lot to some but hands down the most I’ve ever made) I’ve been here for about a year. 

Often the “strongest” (or most commonly regurgitated arguments) you hear against raising the minimum wage are that it’s low-skilled/lazy/easy labor thus lower wages. 

In my own personal experience I’ve found quite the opposite. The jobs I worked making less $$ were not only harder (both physically &amp; mentally) than the job I have now but I’d have to deal with being looked down upon &amp; spoken to like I’m beneath the customer (which takes its toll on you) whereas being a collection specialist (though I deal with disgruntled borrowers) they speak to you as if you’re an authoritative figure (trust me I’m not lol). 

This whole notion of if you just work hard you’ll be successful is complete bullshit &amp; the ppl that parrot that are either 1. Duped or 2.

Religious (especially Christian) beliefs completely undermine a pro-life stance in the abortion debate.,"I've always found it strange how conservative, fundamentalist Christians tend to be some of the most vocal opponents against legalized abortions for a number of reasons that I'll explore below. Since some of these arguments apply to any religious person, I decided to include ""religious beliefs"" in the title too, but ultimately I am mostly referring to Christian pro-lifers since that is what I am most familiar with.

For the record, I generally lean more pro-choice, but I also recognize that there are many solid arguments against abortion as well. My point, however, is *not* to argue for or against abortion in general: rather, my stance is that religious pro-life arguments *specifically* are weak and generally fail to support the pro-life stance with any logical consistency, therefore weakening the stance as a whole.

Here are my justifications:

&amp;#x200B;

**Point I: The Assumption of God's Creation / Sanctity of Life**

A religious person might say that God is responsible for creating every human life and therefore we should care for each of his creations, unborn or otherwise. However, if we are expected to care for each and every fertilized egg because it's a new human being he created, why are there millions of miscarriages each year? What about stillbirths? Unexplained infant deaths due to SIDS? These admittedly are difficult questions to ask, but from a philosophical standpoint, where is the evidence that God cares about the sanctity of unborn lives if so many children die before they turn 1? 

If God does not seem to care about the sanctity of life, then why should we?

&amp;#x200B;

**Point II: The Assumption of An Afterlife (Heaven and Hell)**

So let's assume a fetus is not miscarried and instead is growing in the womb just fine. Let's also assume that this fetus also has a soul for argument's sake. If this fetus is aborted, what happens to its soul? I imagine it'd go one of three, possibly five ways:

1. It'd go to heaven (because it never got a chance to be saved, therefore a just God would not punish it)
2. It'd go to purgatory / some sort of limbo (because it never got a chance to be saved nor condemned, therefore it cannot belong either in hell or heaven)
3. Its soul never fully developed and therefore it ceases to exist.

Additionally, you could argue that this soul could go to hell or be reincarnated, but since there is neither historical, logical nor biblical justification for such stances I decided to leave them out for simplicity's sake. Even so, however, the notion of an afterlife is problematic for the pro-life argument:

1. If it automatically goes to heaven, then abortion is a good thing because it leads one to eternal paradise without suffering or risk of eternal damnation once born.
2. If it goes to purgatory, the above argument applies since the soul will eventually reach heaven. If there is a good and just God, the soul will not suffer forever because it has done nothing wrong.
3. If the soul simply ceases to exist, then at least it will have avoided the risk of eternal damnation once born. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Point III: The Historical / Biblical Precedent of Killing Children (+ Apologetics!)**

For anyone who's ever looked into Lee Strobel's *The Case for Faith*, there's a really interesting chapter about the killing of innocents and how apologetics may reconcile that with a (supposedly) just and fair deity. I'm more or less just gonna quote it here:

After the author discusses the genocide of the Amalekites with Norman L. Giesler, Giesler says:

&gt;""According to the Bible, every child who dies before the age of accountability goes to heaven to spend eternity in the presence of God.""

Strobel then challenges this, asking:

&gt;""If ultimately it was best for those \[Amalekite\] children to die before the age of accountability because they would go to heaven, why can't the same thing be said about unborn children who are aborted today? \[...\] If they're aborted, they're definitely going to heaven, but if they are born and grow up they might rebel against God and end up in hell. Isn't that a forceful argument in favor of abortion?""

I don't really find myself compelled by Giesler's response, really, but I'll lay it out anyway:

&gt;""No, that's a false analogy \[...\] First, God doesn't command anyone today to have an abortion; in fact, it's contrary to the teachings of the Bible. Remember, he's the only one who can decide to take a life, because he's the ultimate author of life. Second, today we don't have a culture that's as thoroughly corrupt as Amalekite society. In that culture, there was no hope; today, there's hope.""

After this he moves onto how the Amalekites deserved what they got because they didn't repent, leaving the abortion topic behind. This surprised me because it felt like he was more or less brushing the issue aside, and unless you believe in Divine Command theory, I find it hard to accept that genocide is acceptable while terminating a pregnancy is not.

The Amalekites are not the only people to be wiped off the earth in the Bible, either. There are a number of genocides, enslavements, and other violent cruelties that occurred under God's command, and as such it makes life seem less and less valuable through the eyes of religion, only valuable to the extent that it is useful to God and nothing else. If that is the case, then life really isn't that important to begin with and choosing to carry a pregnancy to term has less to do with sanctity of life and more to do with *because God said so*. 

**TL;DR:** Overall, I don't see how religious arguments strengthen the pro-life argument in the abortion debate. While there are good secular arguments against abortion, claims such as sanctity of life are completely undermined by religious concepts such as the afterlife and the seeming precedent of God not caring to save millions of unborn children annually.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious to see what counter-arguments there'll be to this.

"Going off the history of colonization &amp; interaction with weaker countries, Palestine would have not been around to see the 21st century if they were dealing directly with the UK, France, Germany, US or Japan.","What do I mean exactly? 

I mean that if the positions were switched, and Palestine was dealing with the US, UK, Germany, Japan and other countries instead of Israel, the would have not been tolerated this long. 

I believe the Palestinians would no longer be a global controversial situation. I believe that lines would be drawn, that the global community of sovereign nations would recognize &amp; many many more Palestinians would be dead.

Japan was absolutely brutal in China and Korea. TheThe Belgians were responsible for one of the largest genocides in the Congo.

"With all the debate over lessening the burden of college debt, there should be more focus on the accessibility of research from academic journals.","If there is anything I have learned from my college experience, it’s two things: First, that a fair amount of students aren’t that motivated to learn more than it takes to pass a class. Second, that learning doesn’t stop after college. Sadly, I believe that if college were to be free it would lessen the quality of the education itself, as more people that are less motivated to learn would be willing to attend (honestly that is in my opinion a good thing, albeit expensive to the public and perhaps not the most efficient). I worry that it would essentially make college either hyper competitive (like some European countries) or essentially high-school round 2. Both seem to be a deprecation of the university experience. I value the role of education to the highest caliber, but I have personally seen how other students do not invest in learning the material. Phones in class, skipping lecture, C’s get degrees, not doing any reading, etc. I expect this to get worse if it is free. 

On the other hand, for those trying to learn after graduation or learn outside of university, there are often excessive monetary barriers to access current research. This makes continuing education, or even self education from someone who didn’t go to college, extraordinarily costly. Given the amount of new information and constant change, staying informed of the progress seems extraordinarily important for an educated society. While many politicians have addressed the problems of student loans, I haven’t heard anything about removing the paywall to academic research through government subsidizes or the like. 

I want to clarify that primary schools definitely deserve the most investment overall as they provide essential education and other important services. But between college and accessibility of information, the latter doesn’t get enough justice. 

I believe that while both are vitally important for the progression of our civilizations, providing the opportunity for free self-education should be more of a priority than free college. Change my view.",f5bldo,"The biggest issue i've heard about the college debt problem, is that there will be gigantic economic issues with an entire generation all saddled with an inordinate amount of debt. This will impact industries all over if people don't have savings for a majority of their life. 

Making research free would only serve to make academic journals loose money that they use to (in my guess) fund more research. 

Besides, most degrees aren't equatable with reading a lot of research. It would allow people to study without the benefit of their work being counted towards authorization in their field. 

There is an issue with people not taking college seriously, but it's a tragedy for everyone involved that parents push kids to get into academic fields, saddling their kid with debt when the kid ends up going to a different specialized job like electrical or service work where they actually fit best in.",fhxv8yk,3.0
"The word ""spiritual"" is synonymous with ""imaginary""","Calling something ""spiritual"" seems to be a way people justify to themselves believing something that deep down they know they have no good reason to believe.

being attracted to/sexualising anime characters isn't wrong when they're not designed as minors,"now let me explain.

I've seen quite some controversy about this in the last couple weeks about grown people being attracted to 16 year old anime characters. However, those characters do not look like children.
We all know anime can be weird with their character design. A 9000 year old can look like a 5 year old child and a nine year old can look like a fully grown woman.
I don't think it is bad to be attracted to an anime character when they are obviously designed to look adult. If you only look at the age you will have people saying that it's okay to sexualize a little kid just because the anime says they're 18+. That's pedo baiting. But no, people focus on a 22 year old saying a 16 year old character is hot when they obviously look grown.

I don't think age matters in anime, only design (look at josuke from jojos. He's supposed to be 17.)

Please let me know your thoughts on this.",ljocjz,"The entire problem with this argument and all arguments like it happens to be that fictional characters don't have calculable ages.

"the people involved in the crimes on capitol hill are not some evil genius organising, they are just a bunch of crazies that through multiple lucky breaks were able to enter the building and disrupt procedure.","It feels like everyday I read the news it contradicts the previous day's news. 

When news broke of capitol building being invaded everyone started saying the police let them do it.

Now the narrative has correctly changed to police did everything they could and even died defending the building.

Not a lucky break more common sense; Why would you put a police presence at the capitol building? You don't need to spend tens of thousands doing that when there are no protests or marches planned there and it has its own force. Miles away at the trump rally is where you need your police presence.

Lucky break 1: police didn't communicate or were not aware of the magnitude of the march that was descending on the capitol building.

Lucky break 2: by surrounding the building they caused police that were there to be split by 360 degrees. Limiting the ability to bottle neck and stop protesters.

Lucky break 3: they started breaching the building, any police that successfully were holding the outside bottlenecks were now forced to retreat to help contain what's happening inside.

Lucky break 4: any back up that did arrive first had to disperse the outside before that could even get inside.

Lucky break 5: misinformation - which cannot really be helped but everyone reporting different versions of what was happening would hamper operations.

Lucky break 6: timing - every issue was compounded by the speed at which things happened it took only 2 hours from trump's speech ending for the *protestors* to get to the building climb the walls and begin entering the building. Police reporting no need for back up crowd is contained would soon be shocked to see crowds gathering behind them as protestors climbed walls forcing them to give up their surrounded position and fall back.

The entire thing was opportunist with protestors doing there own things like taking selfies or stealing property or trying to break into other chambers or simply protesting outside.

It really does not take much to overwhelm a force defending a building that can be accessed from multiple directions, a large enough mob can easily do it. 

If police had known there would be a march aimed at the capitol building instead of a stationary rally at the Ellipse they would have been much more prepared.",kv2znn,"Do you consider Trump using language like ""we're going to march to the Capitol and fight"" and Giuliani calling for a ""trial by combat"" as a lucky break?

Preventing mass shootings in the US will be nearly impossible due to the massive numbers of privately held guns.,"Given the recent tragedies in El Paso and Dayton, many people offer suggestions on how to prevent future mass shootings. As an American, I agree that there should be more attention and public awareness regarding mental health, gun safety, and best protocols in an active shooter situations.  I even agree with some gun control, specifically banning the use of military grade weapons modified for civilian use (e.g., semiautomatic weapons).

However, the U.S. has the highest rate of gun ownership on the planet.  It’s too easy for any wacko to go to an arms show and buy an AK-47 and then shoot up a random event.  And even if we banned the sale of these types of weapons, there’d be plenty semi-automatic weapons floating around on the black market (I can see an argument that the cost of a semiautomatic weapon would be prohibitive on the black market, but that wouldn’t solve the problem completely).

Many gun control opponents point to the case of Switzerland, which doesn’t suffer the same amount of mass shootings even though almost every household there owns at least one gun. I would counter that by mentioning the general mindset of Swiss society, which engrains the use of weapons for military purposes and hunting.  It seems like many people here in the US think shooting a real gun is like playing Call of Duty.

Edit: After reading through this thread, my argument is now as follows: we should start by banning semiautomatic weapons as in Australia after the Port Arthur massacre.  This won't stop the problem overnight, but it would make purchases of such weapons more expensive and thus mass shootings would be less common.

TL/DR:  I think the USA will never solve the gun problem with so many weapons floating around in private hands.  Even if we banned the sale outright, you’d just have a thriving black market.",cmq9ep,"With time all things are possible, guns don't last forever, they break, get lost, stolen, seized, etc. Without a supply of new guns eventually they will all leave circulation one way or another.",ew45rbb,2.25
"You need dysphoria to be trans, and people who say otherwise may be putting vulnerable people at risk without realising it","All the major trans subreddits maintain the position that you don't need dysphoria to be trans, and I've been banned for saying otherwise, or for trying to talk to people about this and change my view, so I thought here was the right place for it. 

 I am transgender FTM. I have dysphoria (a feeling of discomfort or disconnect with my gender assigned at birth and my real gender) it manifests, at its best, as being unhappy with the feminine aspects of myself, and at its worst, and a complete hatred and disassociation from them, to the point of wanting to tear my chest off and never talk again. 

I genuinely don't understand what makes you trans if it isn't dysphoria. Or why you'd transition if you didn't have dysphoria. So many people (young girls particularly) feel uncomfortable with themselves, and latch onto being trans as an answer. If they don't have dysphoria, when they transition, they give themselves dysphoria, then have to detransition, which normally leads to them preaching that being trans isn't real and it's a ploy to hurt people. All the time, someone will show up on r/asktransgender saying ""I'm a man and I'm perfectly comfortable with that, never had dysphoria, but I like wearing dresses"" and all the comments will say ""you're trans, egg!"" Surely that's damaging!? Being gender non conforming is not the same as being trans, and saying that it is, is why we end up with all these neo-pronouns. 

Science only has evidence for FTM, MTF, and NB trans people. Neo-pronouns and trenders are hurting the image of the community. They're what the right wing uses as a straw man for all trans people, and, as I said before, it encourages people to transition and give themselves dysphoria/ possibly irreversible physical changes. 

As a disclaimer: you absolutely do not need to have medically transitioned, or even want to, to be trans. You just need dysphoria. But that comes in loads of forms, and with varying intensities! Maybe you get bad social dysphoria, but very little/no voice and/or body dysphoria. Good for you, you're valid! But if you have no dysphoria of any kind, present as fully female but use he/him pronouns... I'm sorry, you're hurting the community and you're not transgender.

Edit: this blew up and my view has been changed on a few things, while a lot of people are misunderstanding my points. Let me clarify:

- being trans is a mental illness/ sexual disorder of some kind. We gotta get rid of the stigma around that, that's why people get so upset about it.

- MY VIEW HAS CHANGED ON THIS! Dysphoria is like depression, it's a scale. Some people might be driven to suicide from it, while for some people it might not effect their daily lives almost at all

- I'm not walking around saying if people are valid or not. I'm scared that this movement is going to make impressionable kids thing they're trans, and transition when they shouldn't. Giving themselves dysphoria and hurting themselves. 

OK I need sleep, and I really can't answer all of the comments, especially when I'm repeating myself a lot. When I wake up I'll find unique ones and respond. If I don't answer you, I've answered it somewhere else",cpgryt,"&gt;I have dysphoria (a feeling of discomfort or disconnect with my gender assigned at birth)

Are you uncomfortable with your gender or how you're being perceived as that gender? Do you even think there's a difference?

Why are you uncomfortable with the feminine aspects of yourself and what does that have to do with your gender?

Do you want to tear your breast off because of how they're perceived by your desired partners? 

Because they cause you physical discomfort? 

Or because you find your breast unattractive?

If you find your breast unattractive, what would you say is unattractive about them?

These questions will lead to why I don't think this ""gender dysphoria"" makes you trans.",ewpazg0,2.75
John 1:1 is mistranslated,"edit: Delta for the fact that I agree that titles should be translated as titles. But my original point that logos refers to Christ still stands

edit2: Delta for “he” should be “this” in John 1:2-4

Ok, so in the NASB, John 1:1 is translated as “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” In the original Greek, the term “logos” is being translated into “word”. I think that this is a horrible translation. In Christianity, the term “logos” refers to the son in the trinity. This is backed up by several church fathers (see link)

[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos_(Christianity)

Honestly I have no idea why logos is being translated as “word.” If logos refers to the son, then logos should be translated as “the son”. “in the beginning was the son, and the son was with god.” This makes perfect sense considering the next few verses say:

HE was in the beginning with God.
 -John 1 : 2

All things came into being through HIM, and apart from HIM nothing came into being that has come into being.
 -John 1 : 3

In HIM was life, and the life was the Light of men.
 -John 1 : 4

See the male pronouns? Who is “he” referring to? The son of course. It’s obvious that logos refers to a person, that is, the second person in the trinity. It can’t possibly be referring to the term “word.”

I just don’t understand the need to say “word”. It’s not only wrong but unhelpful. I’ve even seen the shoddy translation of John 1:1 used to justify absurd heresies. Like very cryptic interpretations of the Bible by heretics who jump from verse to verse to verse to reach some absurd conclusion.

Can anyone justify the claim that “logos” should be translated as “word”

Like actually justify not “well x Bible scholar said so.”",tsb1l6,"Your pronouns are wrong.

From the Vulgate:

""hoc erat in principio apud Deum""

Looking at the Greek, what you take as ""He"" is ""houtos.""  That, in Koine Greek, meant ""this.""  It is masculine, because in Greek, ""ho logos"" (=""the Word"") is also masculine.  There is no pronoun in John 1:1 that clearly refers to ""ho logos"" or ""the Word"" as Jesus personified.",i2qvexd,3.0

"“Knuckle-dragger” is not a racial slur towards black people, and if you think it is you are projecting your own racism","Recently a weather reporter made a tweet towards warriors player Draymond green and called him a “knuckle-dragger”, and has caused massive online outrage and this will most likely end his career for good. The tweet made no mention of race whatsoever. 

As far as I am aware, calling someone a knuckle-dragger as an insult means they act like a dumb caveman or something. It can be applied to any race. Just because racist people may have in the past at some point used the phrase to describe a person of a race they are racist towards, for example black people, does not mean that the term is inherently racist towards black people. If you see that phrase, and you immediately jump to thinking it’s a slur directed towards black people, all you are doing is projecting YOUR own racist beliefs, whether they are conscious or subconscious. It is far more racist to assume knuckle dragger is a racial slur towards black people than it is to call a black person a knuckle dragger in a context that has absolutely nothing to do with their race.

Unless I am misinformed and historically this has been a slur primarily associated with black people, or predominantly used by white supremacists or something like that? If someone can present actual evidence of this then I am open to changing my view regarding the use of this phrase.

I think HR is useless and should be automated and be rid of,"This is completely biased view based on my experience only and I need someone to tell me HR is useful coz to me they’re completely useless and literally anyone could do their role and it could be distributed across org in another way and be heavily automated.

Ok, recruiting finds new hires. HR coordinated interview, onboarding, and new hire complaints. they are the conduit between the new hire and the company, its their job to make sure that new hires get onboarded seamlessly and that all applicable laws and paperwork are filed. Recruiters dont have the time or training, and your idea to expand roles to absorb HR just means a specialized recruiter who does HR work. IT has no bandwidth to coordinate everything, or to do exit interview's 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;personnel issues:office drama can be handled by the manager or another manager or a designated conflict resolution person who can go through some training.

The point of having HR handle personnel issues is to insulate the manager. The idea is that, if you can only report to someone in your chain of command, people will be less inclined to come forward with issues. Lets say your boss is best friends with the CEO. How do you complain about sexual harassment? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;salaries: now i dont know how payroll works and the laws etc but Ik there’s accountants etc who deal w this and i dont know how HR is involved in this and don’t understand why they need to be.

HR doesn't set salaries, im not sure why you think they're involved? All HR does is get the budget for a new role from the hiring manager.

That point of contact in the company is HR. They're the designated person for all of these complaints. Same goes for training, workplace relationships, etc.

There's nothing necessarily wrong with a population of a culture voluntarily dying out or 'killing' their culture,"Here's what I mean. So my immigrant friends, one Irish, one from Singapore, and I (Chinese Immigrant) were discussing your experience. All our parents showed disappointment in us not continuing 'our culture'.. 

Personally, I just don't see the point in continuing something just for the sake of it. Personally, I would prefer an easy life and reducing sufferance over 'culture'. So here's the first kicker.

My Irish friend said that their grandparents wanted to 'revive' Irish language. I say, who cares? Like if the younger generations prefer to merge with England, speak English etc? Why not. If this gives them better economic prospects, why not.

Now here's another scenario in which I cannot seem to agree with the view.

If I died right now, with no children, why is it bad? Sure, maybe my death is bad, but the lack of children isn't so concerning, since no people exist to mourn. So now what happens if, say, everyone in, say, Singapore, decided to stop having babies? I was thinking about this because I was watching videos about isolated communities as well as countries with declining birth rates.

Yes, the biggest concern is the so called 'last generation'. But after that? Why does it matter? Like if I was the last Chinese on earth, and was offered to clone or whatever myself, why should I? I never want children. I see no reason for me to 'continue' on 'Chinese' 'gene' or 'culture'

And now, here's the last one. This one I'm always told is the most extreme. I say that if you are dissatisfied with your own life, depression, famine, etc, it is best not to have kids. (I don't agree with sterilization, this isn't really about that, but simply 'morality') If letting a kid go through famine, such as starving and neglecting your kid is bad, why is having a kid for the sake of 'keep the gene alive' good? 

I know someone will say it's racist. That's what I've always been told. Again, I don't get it. If I was a jew knowing i was being hunted by hitler, I definitely wouldn't start trying for a kid. So why is it 'racism' or 'bad' to tell poor people etc to not have kids? I myself am poor. I think not having a kid when poor is better than having kids. I know someone will say poverty is subjective. I agree, which is why I say 'if you think x threshold is a bad environment to have kids' then you shouldn't have kids.

There is nothing wrong with materialism and capitalism.,"If you were born within the 21st century, you've probably grown up watching countless ads, whether it be for the new iPhone or the new Xbox or the new BMW. Many people argue that modern society has stripped humans of any core essence, turning them into nothing more than consumers of material goods. This is the argument against materialism and capitalism and part of the foundation for the minimalist movement we see going on today. 

What I don't understand is that humans are inherently designed to consume. We can't grow without consuming food. We can't communicate without buying a phone or laptop (for the average person in the 21st century). We can't get to a far destination without buying a car. Life necessitates consumption. So why not strive to have the best form of what you are consuming? I've been trying hard to wrap my head around how some people can be so content with so little. Why do rich and famous people tell you being grateful for what you have is the key to a happy life? How can I be content with the 200 sq.ft dorm room I'm in when I know they are living in a 3000 sq. ft NYC penthouse? How can I be content with an iPhone 4, for example, when I know an iPhone 6 is out in the market? Shouldn't we as humans always strive to achieve the best material goods out there to consume? Is there an inherent desire for humans to consume or is materialism just a product of modern day marketing?

Look, I understand that it can become dangerous when you let material goods define you. But rejecting materialism and capitalism is something I can't quite wrap my head around.

the anime community is the reason why most normal people can't bring them self to watch anime,"As a teen I watched anime (I'm a twenty year old on reddit it sould be self explanotary). After a while I started to seek out people and communities on the internet that would share that interest. And one of the very first things I saw was a guy talking about how good pedofilia in anime was. The worst part is that most comments supported him in his belief.

There are a lot of stereotypes that relate to anime watchers or at least nerds in general, and the anime community does nothing to separate them self from it. I can remember a video by some big anime youtuber (I don't remember his name but he had a few hundred thousand subscribers) that was basically him talking about how drawing porn of underage girls was okay because they were just drawings. 

But let's not talk about pedofilia so much. So, a lot of anime fans are really sexist, like actually to a ridiculous extent. Anime is generally targeted towards teen boys so it doesn't make that much effort to develop or explore female characters (keep in mind that I'm not talking about every single show, I'm just saying that it is defintly a common thing). So a lot of anime fans treat woman like (most) anime treats it's female characters, that is to say with little to no respect. For specific examples just suggest that your are a girl on one of the numerous message boards, you will be floded with ever flavour of sexism there is.

The last problem doesn't seem like the worst, but it essentially creates ever other problem. The *elitism*.  There are many kinds of elitism that anime fans like: ""my favorite show is better than yours"", ""you are enjoying/not enjoying an anime I dislike/like and there for I a a better person"",  ""you are not allowed to watch this specific show because (something sexist/rasist most probably)"", and of course ""As if you would even understand"". I feel like I don't have to go in depth with this one, the over the top examples show exactly how I feel.

The problem is that I like Anime, I'd even would co side my self a fan/web if not for the community. And I'd love to recommend shows like Evangelion, Beastars, cowboy Beebop, fullmeatl alchemist: Brotherhood, JoJo's etc. But I know that I will get the weird looks from them. 

To clarify I am not saying that every single anime fan is like this, just that a majority is like that. I know that the Lou.d minority allways makes the entire group look bad, but in this case it's often hard to find people who are not exactly like the weeb stereotypes.

Edit: okay, I had a lot of conversation with lots of people (never expected for this to get so big overnight). So writing a comment would be pretty pointless since I generally agree with you. I also think that it is because of anime it self rather than just the community that most people are turned off by .

I'd also like to say that Beastars, whole extremely good in my opinion,  is a really bad example of an anime that you could recommend to an average person LoL.
I also forgot to mention that I'd already consider most anime to be not that good. Not that the people who watch it are bad, but that the show them self make me cringe.

Edit 2: I feel like I learned quite a bit on the topic, and I discovered a plethora of reasons why people don't like anime (I know it sounds silly). Many people don't like animation, many people find anime to be too over the top, many anime courses people to become  these shitty fans rather then the opposite, sometimes it's just ignorance and not wanting to read subtitles/watch a foreign film, I also now realise that I was talking about a small vocal minority rather than the larger whole. And while I love to argue more (a big majority of you were kind and understanding while discussing) I have switched my view point so there isn't really a point to it. So I'm not going to respond to further arguments, I will also give deltas to people who persuaded me.

Schools are too authoritative.,"
There is the obvious comparison to prison and most people shrug it off, but having a large fence around a school, having teachers demand authority and respect by only answering to their surnames and being able to give direct commands instead of asking nicely all seem a bit far fetched to me.

It all bears a strange resemblance to the Zimbardo Prison experiment, which was an interesting insight into conformity. They simulated a prison and everyone who was handed authority on a silver platter abused it, whilst those stripped of their respect were forced to obey.

In my opinion, while it may prepare children to follow the law once they leave school, I don’t think it’s the best way to go about it. There’s a distinct lack of freedom and two way respect in the system that bugs me from time to time. 

I know for a fact that this isn’t an effective way of teaching because the kind of toxic environment schools are today and likely always have been can cause depression in the young and impressionable children attending.

Don’t get me started on patriotism in schools. Schools in a fair few countries serve a secondary purpose to indoctrinate their students into a way of thinking that may be downright dangerous. “Stand for the flag”, “Sing the Anthem”. However my main grievance with this is one thing that a buddy of mine from Oklahoma told me about:

In the US (and I’m not flaming the US because I’m from England and we’re also guilty of this) there’s a curriculum that, if I remember correctly, is called JROTC. JROTC is near enough the antithesis of the poem Dulce Et Decorum Est, a poem that is very anti-war. The poem is about the lies they were told when enlisting, and I guess whilst it’s not entirely relevant, somewhere in my monkey brain I can see JROTC as being a thing to entice young people to put their whole lives into becoming part of the Corps. 

That last paragraph was very rambly and I’m very sorry for wasting everyone’s time with it, but I just needed to get it off my chest. Please, discuss with me.",urt1ff,"&gt; the Zimbardo Prison experiment, which was an interesting insight into conformity

"The Internet needs to stop naming, shaming and judging random people caught on video","There are 2 problems with the this brand of Internet judgment. I don't mean like the George Floyd (and others) police videos, that was confirmed by the media and authorities, and it was a case of brutality and murder. I mean the random, civilian angry  person ones (I'd say ""Karen"" but i really dislike using that name as a derogatory term) or the Facebook posts saying ""name and shame this person"" +photo. 

A. Get the wrong person and ruin their life for no reason other than their physical appearance. We know it's happened, I don't need to mention Boston.

B. You don't know what was happening to that person at that time. Mental health problems? Were they set up before the video? Is this out of character for them? Was it just a really bad day? 

Random people on the Internet shouldn't be destroying a person's life based on a picture couple of minutes video, without knowing anything else, or having any authority or moral grounds to do so. People make mistakes, it doesn't make them all evil, deserving of losing everything, just as doing something great doesn't make you all good. 

I do understand that racism and abusive behaviour should be called out so i don't know what the right way of doing it should be and I understand that being able to film someone can keep you safer, so i don't have a problem with filming, it's posting it and basically have the ""almighty righteous"" Internet  judges ruin that person that i think it's wrong.",gzjst1,"I think you've accurately identified a real problem, in that people's lives are being unfairly adjudicated by the public. However, I think the causes that you are attributing to these are not the causes, but events in a story line. 

Imagine an event in pre-internet times, and you witness a guy named Joe go berserk. Joe got butt naked and attacked people around him, seemingly for no reason. There are multiple witnesses to the event. Are those people bound by some code to not say anything to the their friends, and family? If one of those people happens to know Joe's employer personally, would it be inappropriate to let them know about Joe's conduct? Should they not inform the police as it wasn't fair for Joe to be portrayed by this one event? If you are inclined to answer no the above questions, then the internet is the same idea, albeit more widespread and disconnected. Nevertheless, the event happened, Joe did it, and he should be accountable for it. 

Here is where I would argue the problem lies. If one or two people report to Joe's employer or network that he had an episode, they may speak to Joe to ensure he is ok. They would attempt to investigate and understand. As it stands with the internet, this doesn't appear to be the case. The size of the transgression doesn't even appear to be relevant, the size of the backlash is the driving factor in the outcome. For me, the cause here isn't that external parties are witnessing, discussing, sharing or judging Joe, it is that Joe's employer displays cowardice out of fear over the public backlash and threat to their business, and by extension, themselves. 

Take for example, the editor of the NYT who was recently outted. The individual did nothing in respect to conduct, he just fell afoul of public and private adjudication. The cowardice of the management to not back him gives power to people to continue to rule as a mob. James Damore is another great example, or James Gunn, or Rosanne Barr, or however many other countless examples. 

Selfish and cowardly management is the cause, the existence of a medium for distributing information is simply a reality. People wouldn't feel empowered or compelled to act as if they have a say in a person's future, if these organizations had a backbone and ignored the pigeons. That is the real problem. People are people, the internet is the internet, that much can't be changed. However, if a person spends their life whining about a multitude of issues that don't impact them in any meaningful way, and nobody takes their complaints seriously, they will either unlearn the behavior, or become ostracised as a useless blowhard. The managers and true adjudicators in society need to reinstitute due process, and remember the being a rehabilitator and mentor is far more productive than being a terminator. 

As a side point, one of the greatest ironies of our time is that those on the activist left are the very first to demand punitive action against individuals for some faux pas or larger transgression, yet their overall theory about those dragged into the criminal justice system, even for violent or anti-social crimes, is that they need to be coddled and rehabilitated but not punished.",ftidzaw,4.0

"If employers expect a two week notice when employees quit, they should give the same courtesy in return when firing someone.","I’ll start off by saying I don’t mean this for major situations where someone needs to be let go right away. If someone is stealing, obviously you don’t need to give them a two week notice. 
 
So to my point. 

They always say how it’s the “professional” thing to do and you “don’t want to burn bridges” when leaving a job. They say you should give the two week notice and leave on good terms. Or that you should be as honest with your employers and give as much heads up as possible, so they can properly prepare for your replacement. I know people who’s employers have even asked for more than the two weeks so that they can train someone new. 

While I don’t disagree with many of this, and do think it is the professional thing to do, I think there is some hypocrisy with this. 

1) Your employers needs time to prepare for your departure. But if they want to let you go they can fire you on the spot, leaving you scrambling for a job. 

2) The employer can ask you to stay a bit longer if possible to train someone, but you don’t really get the chance to ask for a courtesy two weeks. 

3) It puts the importance of a company over the employee. It’s saying that employee should be held to a higher standard than an employer. As an employee you should be looking out for the better of this company, and be a “team player”. 

Sometimes there are situations where giving a two week notice isn’t needed. If you have a terrible employer who you don’t think treats you fairly, why do you need the two week notice? If you feel unappreciated and disrespected, why is it rude to not give a notice? 

If that’s the case then why do people not say the same about employers firing people with no notice? How come that’s not rude and unprofessional? Why is that seen as a business move, but giving no notice of quitting is seen as unprofessional? 

If we’re holding employees to a standard, we should hold companies to the same standards.

The price of your restaurant bill should not dictate how much you tip.,"First of all, I want to clarify that I am not against tipping in anyway. I've worked in the restaurant industry and make sure to always tip well. However, I don't like the common idea of tipping 15-20%  of your bill. For instance, one would tip their waiter $10 if they get a  $50 plate (going with 20% tip here). But tip the same waiter, in the same restaurant,  $4 if they ordered a $20 plate instead . In both instances, you are getting the same quality of food, same service, and the waiter is doing the same amount of work. It doesn't make sense to me to have to give such a larger tip for the same amount of work only because I decided to get a more expensive dish/drink.",o1n0y6,"The bigger question is, why don't restaurants pay a livable wage to its staff.

Separation of church and state is impossible in a democracy,"This is a view that I've held for a while. It seems that every time someone on Reddit or elsewhere criticizes the US for not having separation of church and state, they often bring up examples such as politicians wanting abortions to be banned for religious reasons. But I fail to understand how, in a democracy, a politician shouldn't be allowed to advocate for something on a religious basis. If there are a large portion of religious people living in a democratic country, they have the right to vote for a representative who will advocate for their beliefs, no? Therefore, they will likely vote for a representative who will advocate for their legal views on the basis of religion. Maybe you could say that there should be rules against politicians citing religion as a basis for their policies, but that wouldn't really change anything. Pro-life politicians, for example, would just change their justification from religious ones to moral ones. One potential rebuttal for my view that I can see is the idea that people who criticize the lack of separation of church and state in the US are not advocating for making it illegal to vote based on religious values, but rather saying that it is immoral to do so. Essentially, they are just criticizing religious people for failing to uphold the separation of church and state. But that seems to be a naive view to me. It's my belief that democracy will ALWAYS lead religious people to vote based on their religious values; it is inevitable that it will do so. And therefore, if you advocate for 100% separation of church and state, you must advocate for the abolition of democracy. The values of separation of church and state and the values of democracy are not simply ""at conflict"" in the United States; rather they are completely incompatible with each other.",nizkl1,"It's not ""impossible""; it's just like so many other ideals a such as ""no cruel and unusual punishment"" an absolutely meaningless statement because it's vague.

I know from several people i know that they actively (though secretly) discriminate against women aged around 25-35 when it comes to hiring new job applicants. The reason (at least the stated reason) being that they worry they will become pregnant and take months of paid maternity leave, so will, all things being equal, prefer to hire a man or a woman of a different age, to avoid that possibility. The thing is...this seems perfectly reasonable, most women will have a kid somewhere in that age bracket and they will take time off from work- and rightly so, we *should* be supporting women and by extension the next generation, to have a healthy and happy childhood.

A middle class person is better off living in a small EU country than in US,"This is not really US bashing, it is actually related to a personal choice, and by explaining my thought process I think I am able to represent an average person here (don't get me wrong, my ego is big and I don't think of my self as average in most cases, but in terms of lifestyle and class I certainly think I am.) I also don't want to discuss Trump at all. I recently had a debate with someone who still thinks US provides the most to people who live in it, so I want to see what can US give me that would make me want to live there instead of my (very unimpressive) Country.

I am Croatian, our country had a war, is now in EU, our politicians are generally incompetent, we are no economic force, our salaries are not impressive. I find it beautiful, but I also find US beautiful and I won't be discussing emotional reasons to live in either place here. Just saying, I'm not from Scandinavia or Germany to rightfully brag about doing things ""better"" than the US, but most European countries (even those not in EU) share certain privileges. 

I am university educated with a Masters at the moment, it didn't cost me anything, and I have work experience in one unrelated but very solid field. However while this maybe puts me a bit above average, I am not an entrepreneur (like most people aren't) and have no interest or ability to run my own business. I also don't need to make tons of money. I of course appreciate a good salary and want to be able to live a sustainable, self reliant, comfortable and safe lifestyle  but for me that means - owning an apartment/place to live, not having debt, having retirement savings, being protected in cases of sickness or medical emergencies, being able to pay bills, go out, take courses in something that interests me, travel affordably, have IKEA furniture and wear H&amp;M. Nothing extravagant, because I realistically don't need it and it doesn't motivate me. 

I also care about work life balance A LOT. I want to have free time for myself, for my interests, for people. I don't want my job dominating my life. Most people don't. We need time off, we need vacations. I fear that if I go to US, I will lose generous vacation time and work will be much more intense. I would probably not have a month off or more every year and limitless sick days. I will make more money, but everything will be more expensive and I will desperately depend on my job for medical insurance (so if I quit or lose my job for a short while, I can't get sick?).  I'd rather be unemployed somewhere where it doesn't threaten my livelihood than working somewhere where I can't afford to quit. 

&amp;#x200B;

This brings me to medical insurance. I do understand that while US doesn't have a free health care, you are often insured through work? But many are not. I saw tons of people on reddit explain how much they got into debt because of an accident that involved emergency (so not like they had a choice not to go).  It also seems that your insurance plan might not cover many things if you're not rich which leads to so many movie and show plots where characters have to do something crazy to afford healthcare for themselves or loved one. I hear the argument about being able to choose your doctors but none of it makes sense to me, what do I need to choose for? If I am sick, the ONLY thing I want is that I am helped and cured and that I don't have to worry about money during that. People still have private providers if they want to pay for some additional comforts - but even those private providers aren't that expensive in comparison because they still have to make sense to people who are getting it for free. 

Now, I don't want kids which saves me a lot of problems. But the majority of people do, so let's also explore what that would mean. If I wanted to have a kid in my shitty country, I would not need to be rich. My medical expenses would be covered. Kindergardens are cheap or even free (I will mention, but not focus on the cultural element too where most of us get tremendous help from our families allowing people more free time, but to an extent that is not a guarantee for all). I head that childcare in US is so expensive that often one parent has to stop working because they simply can't manage it. So in the country where without money you're nothing, one person has to lose their job and the other has to better not end up losing it no matter how bad it gets. 

Then we'd have t think about school. Public schools in my country and a lot of Europe are better than private schools, and poor kids and rich kids attend them together (usually when rich kids go to a private school its because they weren't good students in a public school). So the equal opportunity is literally there. I wouldn't have to save ridiculous sums I'd much rather have in my own savings for college because a kid will go into college by merit. And if I do need to put my kid in a private college because they were bad academically and I don't want them to do a trade school (which btw lead to very good employment opportunities and should not be dismissed), it won't be expensive because again, it's competing with free stuff. 

Americans will now say that at least their higher education is the best in world. Ok. I think our free universities are very good too but objectively yes, expensive private universities can afford state of the art facilities and renowned professionals who come and teach. But the class plays such a huge role in where someone will end up. There are some scholarships to keep up the appearance but from what I understand many of the US public schools are very poor quality (or the quality ones require you to live in a certain limited location), while rich kids get prepared from early on. A good public school student who maybe won't get a special scholarship because they aren't extraordinary in sport (what does that have to do with anything?) or in any other way that will get huge attention will be worse off than a bad private school student, because in the end while merit might help a small minority, money will help everyone to get their place even if they're not academically gifted at all. It seems to me that these amazing colleges just serve to give credibility to the already rich who will go on being rich anyway (so that they can pretend that they're actually smart cause they went to Harvard), and maintain the illusion that even the poor/middle class can do it if they work hard enough. 

My final point I know the least about is property. In my country most of us own property - poor, middle class, upper middle class, all have some property they inherited or are able to buy apartments for their kids. During the socialist time many people were given property - my grandpa used his completely average middle class Yugoslavia salary to buy each of his kids an apartment, a big house on the seaside etc. I understand that maybe this was an extraordinary situation and market isn't like that, but I also don't understand why Americans need huge houses and cars and debt either. Maybe this is more lifestyle issue than something that belongs here. But the debt part - I understand you are forced to use a credit card in america or else you don't get access to housing loans. So a person who doesn't buy into the whole consumerism and wants to save money is actually penalized the one time they need to loan to buy property and stop renting. 

You will point out that none of these things are free and we all pay more taxes. Sure, but again, for an average person's average salary with the taxes deducted from it, we get healthcare, education, retirement, care in cases of emergencies and good social programmes as a support through hard times. If your goal is to be an entrepreneur, get filthy rich and don't want too many limitations or taxes because you don't have to give a shit, maybe US is the place for you. 

But most people, including smart and educated people, want a good life. They want balance, they want to be safe, they want their family to be taken care of, they want the freedom to quit a bad job or get sick without going bankrupt, they want time to themselves and people in their lives. i just don't see how the US provides that.

Tl;dr I don't think US is a good place for most people to live in because it forces you to have to be rich to have a decent life. I don't really see what I'd get as an average/middle class person in the US and think life for that group is better in almost any European country (including small, economically weaker ones). I don't think pursuit of money is really a choice in that context and i don't think it's a great way to live a life",j7v3xf,"Dont get biased by the outgroup view of EU.

"[LOTR] Eagles flying the one ring into Mordor was at least as viable a plan as the Fellowship plan, is a plothole, and the only reason it wasn't at least attempted/discussed is because if it succeeded it would have made for a much shorter, less epic story."," Casual Tolkien fan here. I've seen all the films, read the biggies like LOTR and the Hobbit, listened to a few podcast channels, and spent a decent amount of time on wikis and Tolkien related subreddits, but thats it. 

In the Tolkien community ""why didn't they eagles just take the ring to Mordor,"" probably mostly prompted by people who watched ROTK and saw giant eagles stroll casually into Mordor to rescue Sam and Frodo from the erupting slopes of Mount Doom, seems to be widely regarded as a stupid, trite question. [Exhibit A]( https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/6nysuy/lotr_classic_question_solved_why_did_the_eagles/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share); [Exhibit B](https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/eg03vo/in_lotr_why_dont_the_eagles_just_fly_the_ring_to/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share); [Exhibit C](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotrmemes/comments/k83zxz/ngl_this_is_me_especially_after_they_still_refuse/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share); [Exhibit D](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotrmemes/comments/k846vq/why_didnt_they_fly_the_eagles_to_mordormount_doom/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share). 

A whole laundry list of reasons why this wouldn't have been a viable plan are invariably given: 

- The eagles might not have agreed to it 

- Sauron might have seen them 

- They might have had to fight Nazgul on or off Felbeasts 

- Orcs might have shot them down 

- The eagles might have been corrupted by the ring 

Etc. 

And these are all valid points. BUT equally valid points apply to the Fellowship plan and indeed any other plan to destroy the one ring that could have been concocted. There were no good, solid, foolproof plans. All of them were fraught with danger and risk and a high likelihood of not succeeding unless a thousand different rolls of luck and skill were completed successfully. Indeed, its easy to imagine an alternate universe where the eagles had destroyed the one ring where someone asked something like ""hey, why didn't they just send a ragtag team mostly comprised of totally untrained and inexperienced Hobbits to *walk* the Ring across  1,300 miles of perilous and hostile territory, sneak into Mordor somehow, and destroy it that way?"" and you'd have a bunch of Tolkien fans listing off the thousand and one reasons why such a plan isn't viable and would have failed, just like they currently do with the eagle plan. And, ironically, several of those reasons would be identical: Nazgul, being seen, being attacked by orcs, corruption, etc. 

Now, to get a tad conspiratorial, I think the reason that the eagle plan is so vociferously ""debunked"" by Tolkien fans isn't in fact because its such a stupid suggestion, as they almost invariably seem to pretend, but because it was *at least* if not more viable than the Fellowship plan and the fact it wasn't even *discussed* by the Council as a possible plan actually represents a fairly glaring plot hole in the LOTR story, and the reason Tolkien didn't pick it (or even consider it) has nothing to do with in-universe realities making the plan not viable, but simply that it would have made for a much more dull and quick story of how the ring was destroyed, rather than the epic trilogy that Tolkien actually wanted to write. And the reaction is understandable - nobody likes having plot holes in their beloved fiction pointed out, especially one thats so obvious even some non fan who has only half watched of ROTK once might notice. I think that this is why there is such animosity towards people asking that question - its not that its stupid, but rather that it exposes a likely flaw in Tolkien's work and Tolkien fans don't tend to like that.",k8sc69,"First, learn what a plot hole is because this isn't one. 

As to your point, the eagle plan has a fundamental flaw to it that rules it out. There is no way that it can be secret. It is discussed at length in the Fellowship of the Ring that the only way the plan to destroy the ring can succeed is through secrecy because they don't have the force of arms to challenge Sauron and Mordor directly. 

There is nothing secret about using big ass eagles to fly into Mordor. They didn't discuss the eagles at the council because there was no point. They decided on a plan built on secrecy. 

That, plus all the other flaws you listed already, makes it a completely unviable plan.",gezxt7v,3.0
"Before Criticizing China for stealing data, we should acknowledge we did the same to Great Britain","I want to make it abundantly clear that I am not excusing China's actions. Just that we should acknowledge it to prevent hypocrisy.

Many of you may not be aware that the US stole textile manufacturing secrets from Great Britain as we were rising to power. Textiles were a huge market at the time, comparable to tech today.

Now, we are in the position of Great Britain, with China stealing data from us.

Stealing is stealing, and you can't justify it no matter what you do. However, we can at least be transparent about our past. If we don't acknowledge that it happened, we are just having a lot of hypocrisy and the lack of transparency which will hurt us in the long term.

China can take advantage and claim that it's standard procedure to steal from the top country, because the US did it as well. The first thing you hear tends to be the one that resonates the most with you, meaning that the US should acknowledge it, and make clear that we have made mistakes in the past, and have grown to be better. 

Many of you might point out that times are different now, given that we live in the 21st century. I think that when comparing which country is better, we should compare it by the stage of development, not that date that its happening at.

For example, we can't compare Great Britain back then to the US at the time, because they were much more developed than us. However, because we are both quite well off now, we can compare each other.

The same logic applies to China and US.",nganby,What view are we supposed to change here?,gyprq0m,1.5
"Having an LGBTQ+ character in a TV Show isn't ""political""","Two caveats:

Its only really a problem to have an lgbtq+ character in a TV Show, story, or any art form if someone makes it a problem.  Which most people don't.

And literally everything is politicized as politics are omnirelevant to our daily lives.  Politics bleed into everything.

I just finished watching She-ra and the Princesses of Power recently and went online to see what other people think about the show.  Different analysis people have, etc.  Like a lot of nerds do.  And of course as I go down the rabbit hole of fanlore I'm hit with the drama surrounding the show.

""She-ra is political because they made the main character a *lesbian*.""

""They need to stop putting politics into my favorite TV shows.""

There are really only a couple of thoughts I want to point out in response to this.

First off, like I said before.  Literally the only person who thinks that having a gay character in a TV show is ""political"" is the person who, by some amount, dislikes gay people.  And due to their dislike of gay people, end up *making* it a political issue.  

It was only a problem when you made it one.  Before you made it a problem, it wasn't.  

Secondly, its really good that we're finally seeing more representation of various people in art.  More women and girls, more people of color, more lgbtq+ people.  When a person can see themselves represented by the art forms that surround them, it means that they are being heard.  They are validated by the existence of characters who are like them.  When nobody is like them, the opposite occurs and they become disempowered.

Its why as a nonbinary person I really liked how they had a nonbinary character who was played by a nonbinary person in She-ra.

Again, its only a problem to have an enby/trans/gay/poc/whatever character in a show if you make it a problem.  Before you make it a problem, there is no problem with the character itself.

And lastly.  Probably the most frustrating aspect of this as a queer person.  Is that *finally* I get to see a nonbinary/queer character that I can fully relate to.  It does feel empowering and validating to see characters who are ""like me"" in these shows.  But one of the most conflicting problems with this is, that my identity has become politicized.  The thing that I call myself, the thing that I use to explain to people ""who am I?"" whenever they ask.  This self-ascribed label that I form myself around is somehow reduced to a political statement.  

And whenever I say I'm ""nonbinary"" or ""trans"" or anything else that grander society deems ""unacceptable"" I then get people claiming that the only reason I'm doing so is because I have some sort of agenda.  And I'm trying to control people by being some crazy woke-scold that hates straight people and wants to turn the whole world into force-feminized homosexuals or some strange shit that I've never wanted to do in my entire life.

The reason why I developed this identity was not to *impose restrictions on you*, it was to aid in explaining to myself and others how I feel I best fit.  It was to free myself from constraints, not to place constraints onto you.  My existence is only ""political"" because people have a problem with nonconformity.  If people would just do what I want them to do, then the only conversation we'd have would be as simple as:  ""I am nonbinary"" and ""Ok"".  That's it, that's all I expect.  But every goddamn time I say the word I get met with a large, grandstanding argument about gender roles and political problems that never before existed in my mind.",ljyayg,"I think this is part of a broader narrative whereby almost everything has become political due to the political class and media injecting themselves and their relevance into every issue.

"If you are capable of making enough money, the US is the best country in the world to live and work in","There's been lots of discussion about the faults of the States, mostly dealing with how the poor and less-fortunate are treated, e.g. healthcare, housing, social safety nets, etc.

These are valid points, and despite this post, I do admit that if you are poor, many other countries would be preferable to live in.

However, if you're middle class+ with an above average job (let's say top 40% of earners), then few to none of these issues apply.

1. Health insurance is covered by employer. Usually you can get a fantastic low-deductible low out-of-pocket-max plan for cheap, often it costs nothing. Last time I had to go to the hospital and stay overnight, it cost a fixed $200 fee + $15 for parking.
2. Wages for white-collar professionals (especially tech and engineering) are far higher than other first world countries. For example, according to glassdoor the average Software Engineer salary in NYC is $110k, whereas the same job in London would pay $70k.
3. Housing costs tend to be proportional to the local earning potential, so you'll probably be able to afford a house near wherever you work, as long as you're in that upper % of earners. At most you'll need a moderate commute.
4. Taxes are lower than most other developed nations, and that combined with higher wages means a higher take-home.

Now let's look at the advantages of living in the states:

1. Fantastic geographic diversity. Deserts, mountain ranges, tropical islands, dramatic coastline. The biggest trees, the grandest of canyons. The possibilities are endless! And it's all easily accessible to anyone! Our public lands truly are a treasure.
2. A true cultural melting pot. At times it causes conflict, but generally it is a good thing compared to the monocultures of other developed nations.
3. Unlimited room for advancement in your career. Rags to riches is the true American dream, and can happen to anyone with the right drive to succeed, combined with a bit of luck.
4. Some of the world's best Universities, many of which subsidize low-income students. Stanford, for example, is free for those who make less than $150k per year.
5. Capitalism, for all its faults, creates an environment filled to the brim with the latest advancements of pretty much any field (tech, medical, aerospace), and the opportunity to work on the cutting-edge along with the best/brightest within those fields.

I'll admit there are some disadvantages, even if you make enough money.

1. Except for a handful of dense cities (NYC, LA, SF, etc.), public transportation is abysmal. Where's our bullet train? Car culture has become a poison and ruined our cities.
2. Public schooling is terrible in most places, even many high-income areas.
3. Politics here is a shitshow, but it generally won't affect you unless you're poor or an affected demographic.
4. Freedom means everyone has the ability to do what they want, even if you don't like it.",spfet0,"You seem to be assuming that somebody who's earning in the top 40% knows they will stay that way?

In reality there are many things that can get in the way - motherhood(with crap maternity leave), accident, disability, ill health. Even if somebody is employed now, that could change tomorrow and they'll have little to no welfare net to fall back on.

Even if it doesn't affect you personally, chances are if you're old enough you have watched somebody fall into poverty, give up their career for motherhood or put up a Gofundme for medical expenses that other developed nations would have paid for out of taxes.

Most of your advantages are pretty spurious:

1. Geographic diversity - this is balanced by lack of cultural diversity. I live in Europe and the amount of cultural diversity I had cheap access to puts America to shame. And no, going to an Americanised restaurant or a Chinatown is not experiencing cultural diversity in the same way as actually going to another country.
2. Melting pot - this a very reductive way of describing all other nations.
3. Rags to riches - the evidence is actually that [the US is one of the most unequal countries and one where your parents' earnings determine your own earnings the most](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Gatsby_curve). Of developed countries, only Italy and the UK score worse (in the chart in the article).
4. There are nowhere near enough places in Stanford and similar for the number of people who academically qualify. For the vast majority of Americans cost is a deciding factor in where to go. By the way, 16% of Stanford's fantastic quality education is *reserved* for those whose parents went there. Vs 0% in my country's top universities. Besides that, schooling is key to accessing Stanford or later earnings and as you noted, it's incredibly patchy and unequal.

2. The other companies lobby the government for regulation that holds down their competitors, happening all the time in almost any country in the world

Hard word limits in essays reduce the quality of work,"The premise is simple. Having a hard word limit (e.g. 10000 words), with penalties for being over that count (whether mark reduction, ignoring the last x words or just discounting the entire thing) reduces the overall quality of work.

I am all for soft limits, e.g. aim for 10000 words, since for most essays that will be the 'best' amount.

There are a few reasons behind this:

1 - the 'goal'. If you set a limit of 10000 words, people will aim to hit that, even if there is no need to. I've just finished my dissertation, and a lot of people I've spoken to 'finished' theres at around 7000 words, but felt they had to bump the word count up to 10k. Aside from just being wasted energy for both the person writing it and the person reading it, the overall quality of the work is often reduced because it means adding worthless or low value information. 

2 - word reduction. There are plenty of cases where someone will write over the word limit, and have to cut down on the words. I'm one of these people, and there are always 2 steps to word reduction. What information doesnt add anything? And where can I swap words to cut down the number? Removing useless information seems perfectly reasonable to me, but that could be achieved through soft word limits. The issues is picking through the exact words used to reduce the number. Typically it makes the sentences flow worse than they used to, and makes it a less pleasant reading experience overall.

3 - imposed limitations. There is a place for limitations, and for the most part they dont egregiously affect the project. There are however a subsection of people who simply do stellar work. Putting a word limit on can be a limit to the actual substance of the project. There is only so much you can reduce the information you've written, and if someone wants to go outside of the norm, they shouldn't be prevented from doing so.

Now there are 2 answers I'm anticipating. The first is the time taken to mark essays goes up if the average length goes up. It's not wrong, but I feel this is a problem that ought to be met at a staffing level. If it takes 10 percent longer to mark each essay, get 10 percent more staff marking it. I know this isnt necessarily practical, however this is mostly aimed at university level work where (to my understanding) there is actually the money to throw around a little more freely.

The second is that it means people feel they are expected to go beyond. I dont disagree with this entirely, but people already feel they have to go beyond what's expected a lot of the time. Giving the freedom to do so more easily seems beneficial to my understanding.

Edit: looks like my phone is playing up and replies arent going where I mean them to. Trying to sort it",uhp9yl,"&gt; 1

Finishing an essay in so few words would normally indicate that you didn't do enough work, or the work you did wasn't significant enough. If you felt that your essay was truly finished at 7000 words, then you wouldn't feel the need to add more. A similar issue also exists where you have too much work and not enough words to describe it.

&gt; 2

This is a skillset deficiency. The main things that a word limit tests is your ability to be concise and your capability to discern what is and isn't important. Your two steps directly address those two qualities, and if you cannot pull them off, then it is a shortcoming on your part.

For instance, you talk about swapping words, but that is significantly worse than rewriting whole sentences, and contributes to the problem that you are having in that regard.

&gt; 3

This a combo of points 1 and 2. Assuming you're being as concise as possible, your work is exceeding the scope of the project, and that's not good at all. Pretty much every research supervisor in my old uni recommended that you push through your PhD ASAP, because there is zero value in doing something amazing under such constraints when you could do just what's necessary and then do amazing work for projects where those constraints aren't present.",i77hoqw,3.5
The Game Awards 2020 were not rigged just because The Last of Us Part 2 took home many of the awards.,"Before I start, let me make it clear that I don’t think TLOU2 necessarily deserved the awards it got. I think there could’ve been games more deserving of some of the awards. However, that doesn’t mean that I think The Game Awards 2020 was rigged. 
I saw an article and several videos where those that were unimpressed with Naughty Dog winning several of the Game of the Year awards because of The Last of Us 2 called it “rigged.” The general argument is that 10% of the votes to determine GOTY are from normal individuals, and the other 90% are from a jury. The claim is that the 90% are likely all game journalists, which all gave TLOU2 incredibly high scores. However, I don’t think that means that TGA “simps” for Naughty Dog or that it was rigged. 
Take the Game Awards 2016, for example. Overwatch won game of the year. This was against Naughty Dog’s incredible title Uncharted 4, which was an incredible game that arguably deserved the award more. Why wouldn’t the journalist jury of TGA stand up for Naughty Dog that year?
Another example is The Game Awards 2019, where Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice took home GOTY. Sekiro was very much criticized among gaming journalism due to its harsh difficulty. The game weeded out many of the casual gaming journalists. But even then, hardcore gamers found Sekiro to be too difficult at times. So why would have much of the jury at TGA 2019 have voted for Sekiro? 
There could have been things I overlooked, maybe flaws in my beliefs. Please, help me understand if you thing TGA was biased! I’m very open to having my mind changed on this topic.",kb6uhb,"Just take a look at the voting jury:

trickle down economics isn't a thing said by any economist anywhere. It's a buzzword by ideologues which are overwhelmingly journalists. 

&gt; The phrase “trickle down” often comes up in discussions of tax policies. Historically, tax revenues have in a number of instances gone up when tax rates have been reduced. But any proposal by economists or others to cut tax rates, including reducing the tax rates on higher incomes or on capital gains, can lead to accusations that those making such proposals must believe that benefits should be given to the wealthy in general or to business in particular, in order that these benefits will eventually “trickle down” to the masses of ordinary people. But no recognized economist of any school of thought has ever had any such theory or made any such proposal. It is a straw man. It cannot be found in even the most voluminous and learned histories of economic theories...

&gt; When an investment is made, whether to build a railroad or to open a new restaurant, the first money is spent hiring people to do the work. Without that, nothing happens. Even when one person decides to operate a store or hamburger stand without employees, that person must first pay somebody to deliver the goods that are going to be sold. Money goes out first to pay expenses and then comes back as profits later – if at all.  The high rate of failure of new businesses makes painfully clear that there is nothing inevitable about the money coming back.

"If you are reading this, your life has meaning in it. Meaning in life can be seen to be a process that does not begin and end with activity in the human brain.","***If you are reading this, your life has meaning in it.***

Some people say that life is meaningless. But the words they use have  meaning. It doesn't seem to be the case that life is meaningless for people who use language.

***Meaning in life can fruitfully be seen to be a process that does not begin and end with activity in the human brain.***

Some people suggest that words, events, and objects have meaning solely due to human brain activity. These folks suggest that there is a chain of  events starting with the perception of an object, for example, followed by further brain processing that results in a person creating or experiencing the meaning of the object.

The trouble with this model is that it leaves out the formation of the object itself as a vital part of the chain of events that results in its meaning.

It is best to use a natural object to illustrate:

The Rocky Mountains in North America mean something to many people. For  some, they affect the weather and create transportation challenges. For others, they provide a place for recreational activities and scenic  vistas. But the meaning of the Rocky Mountains is only possible because  of billions of years of geological activity that has resulted in their  current configuration. So if a person says that the meaning of the Rocky Mountains is solely the result of human brain activity, they are  leaving out the formation of the mountains themselves as part of the  process of its having meaning.

This reasoning can be seen to apply to the meaning of man-made objects as  well as to the meaning of words, thoughts, feelings, and events. All of  these types of meaningful experience have history and physicality to them that figure into their meaning. In some sense, the history of the universe itself can be seen to figure into the meaning in life.",dr9o11,"

I think it's more that in order for something to convey meaning, there needs to be a conscious observer. Otherwise there is nothing that can perceive the object and then derive meaning from it. 

So yes, the object of perception must itself have a story and existence of its own, but if there is nothing around that can experience it then it cannot be said to have any 'meaning' in any practical sense.",f6gp4hc,2.5

My daughter will never get to make *meaningful* democratic decisions,"My daughter and her generation will get to vote in ~15 years. I'm from Germany but follow a lot of US and European politics and see these bleak trends in both places. The scary part is that these developments only seem to speed up the concentration of power away from the people.

- *Media:* 
With the way media handles politics and the attention economy the meat of politics is not interesting anymore compared to the next set of crazy claims that make the news. 

Unbiased news becomes a rare resource and strategy's to 'get you' with outrageous bits advance further and further. Be it personalized content or echo chambers or even targeted manipulations as the Russia meddling in the us election. 

Thre will only be more tools and tricks to get under our skin with advancing technology.

- *Centrists:* 
The big party's fight each other tooth and nail at least on the outside but much of that seems to be just show. They are not that different and not really willing to any big change. They sit in a comfortable center and fight over minor details. In its worst case they let us fight over the 'lesser evil' as with Trump or Hillary, both of which were despised by countless people even on their side.

This trend of growing closer together while appearing to be vastly different is made into an art these days.

- *Lobbying:* 
While politicians are supposed to listen to the people they listen to money a lot. Money in politics is steadily increasing and I don't see it stopping since it's working well to advance goals in non-democratic ways.

- *Controlling the Internet/Information*: 
Whistleblowers? Prism? Filters? Power of ISP's? Netneutrality? The worst hasn't happened yet but not for lack of trying.

- *Power consolidation:* 
This seems to be the most nefarious aspect, where on a subtle level the way in which we conduct politics is shifted towards a place where we *feel* our vote mattering while the people in power stay in power regardles. Gerrymandering in the US is one of the most blatant ways to do this. Discrediting the Media is another. Overly complex, boring or nontransparent practices make participation frustrating or impossible.

"We should put ""Don't be Shy, Say Hi"" stickers on laptops we use in public.","Assumed is that we should talk to strangers more.  Isn't interacting with strangers in public healthy?  Isn't it a good way to learn social skills, feel out the locals, possibly make friends, or align and organize for a common politic?  

I go to coffee shops often and would talk to pretty much anyone but it's awkward to just walk up to someone and say, ""feel like chatting"" or whatever other fairly innocuous conversation starter.  One could just ask some question and jump right into it but engaging others this way is a skill and can be unwelcome.  How much easier if people had bling that signaled they want to be approached!  This is my thought.  Acting on this, I recently ordered a ""Don't be Shy, Say Hi"" sticker for my laptop.  I haven't tried it out yet, but figure it can't hurt.

We should not impeach Donald trump.,"Political Alignment: Liberal Democrat

Ok, so just so we're clear on impeachment: it will not remove the president from office. That would require 2/3rds of the Senate's approval. I don't mean to insult your intelligence, but the number of twitter comments not distinguishing between impeachment and conviction has me a bit worried.

The thing is, impeachment in election season is highly risky. It's likely that if Donald Trump is impeached, he'll get re-elected in 2020, and now we have to live under that nightmare until 2024.


Ok, so up until this point I've been assuming impeachment won't constitute removal from office. But let's change that. Say the Republican senators are tired of Trump, and vote to remove him from office. We now have president Mike Pence. And he is a *Hardline* conservative. And we can't impeach him too, because Republicans won't have a President Nancy Pelosi.

I am open to change, though. There's something to be said for the moral duty by the house. 

Change my view!",c0871y,"A persuasive argument I’ve heard in favor of impeachment is that it’s an imperative for Democrats to show that they’re doing *something*. How does it look, even in the pages of history, if Democrats don’t at least *try* to impeach him. If only for the message it sends.

No, the Senate probably wouldn’t convict - though at least they’d be on record placing judgement on his crimes. And Pence would be horrible, though in my view not as horrible as Trump. For Trump’s illegal actions now can easily pave the way for a super-Pence in the future. And they’ll  do real, permanent damage to our system. As others have said, Trump is attacking the very core of our system, and the oppressed aren’t going to get any reprieve if our system is destroyed",er4ecb5,2.4
Most Countries in the past and present were not ethnically homogeneous,"There has been a recent push for globalization and multiculturalism throughout the world. The ideal that the entire earth can be a global village with shared economies and cultural/demographic exchange. This plan has been met with backlash in the last few years and the backlash has caused a rise in the popularity of civic and ethnic nationalism. One can argue that this is simply par for the course given the idea that people from vastly different backgrounds constantly interacting with each other is brand new and scary. Those people would be wrong though, because if you actually look at the present and historical ethnic demographics of many regions on Earth, you will find that an ethnically homogeneous nation-state is actually the exception in the world, not the rule.

&amp;#x200B;

I define ethnically homogeneous as the following - a country where 85% or more of the population belongs to a single ethnic group. I define ethnically diverse as the following - a country with at least four ethnic groups and no single ethnic group makes up more than 49% of the country's population. [If you actually look at the ethnic breakdown of various countries](https://www.infoplease.com/ethnicity-and-race-countries), there are only 64 ethnically homogeneous countries while there are 71 ethnically diverse countries with the rest of the nations being somewhere in between. So currently, only 64 out of 194 United Nation recognized states or 32% of countries on Earth actually qualify as ethnically homogeneous. [This is actually corroborated by this map](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9XjD4Pdj224liVk-xUg30mGwFA8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XAQT7353CA2ZXHZZIWYTJE3PCA.jpg) which shows extremely diverse countries throughout the entire world. The only regions on Earth where almost every nation is ethnically homogeneous are Europe, East Asia, and the Caribbean. Of course, there is a difference between a country starting out as diverse due to being the home of many ethnicities, versus a country being made diverse through immigration, but the cherished idea of a nation that is supposed to belong to a specific group of people who all speak the same language, pray to the same god, descend from the same stock, and have a similar culture is actually somewhat rare in the 21st Century.

&amp;#x200B;

But that is the world in 2019. What about the world hundreds of years ago? Even in the past there is not much evidence that various countries were more ethnically homogeneous than today. The very idea of nationalism or a nation-state ran by a particular group a people for a particular group of people [is only a couple centuries old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism#Terminology) and is mostly an [outgrowth from the Thirty Years War.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalian_sovereignty) Before then there were two dominant types of states for most of human history. There were tribal states that mostly consisted of a bunch of small clans that resided in a general area and mainly practiced hunting and gathering. And then there are empires, these big and powerful governments that spread across vast swaths of lands and got millions of people to submit to them. Over time the empires dominated almost all of the tribal states. Before 20th Century decolonization, most people in recorded history lived in an empire of some sort. [The Roman Empire used to control virtually all of Europe and parts of North Africa and the Middle East for centuries.](https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/height-roman-empire-map1.png) During the early 1900s, [25% of the entire world's population was under control of the British Empire.](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/b/British_Empire.htm) All of China and India were dominated by empires for much of their history, and the Mongol Empire stretched for over 9 million square miles. In these empires like the Ottoman and others, subordinate nations and ethnic groups used to travel across the imperial boundaries in order to trade, deliver taxes, serve in armies, or celebrate in festivals. The capitals of many of these empires at their peak were just as multicultural as many of the megacities in the modern era are.

&amp;#x200B;

So my point is that multiculturalism or globalization or diversity is ultimately nothing new or unique. What we are seeing now is some of the few remaining homogeneous regions of Earth become multiethnic like plenty of other places in the past and present. Whether ethnic homogeneity is a good or bad thing is up to a person's opinion, but regardless of your stance, it wasn't really the norm in many settings.",e8gruj,"By your own data, it is unique and new in_europe_",fabu61b,1.5

I think servers should be paid minimum wage,"I would like to state that this topic is not about whether you should tip or not. Another point I would like to add is that we are assuming that every servers get paid minimum wage if one earns less than minimum wage from the tips. I was wondering why so many people get mad at others when they do not tip the standard 15%. Being a server isn’t a strict job (no degree, education, training or danger). I see that it is a physically demanding job, but there are other physically or mentally demanding jobs are pays minimum wage as well (day care workers, customer support, etc). I thought that due to the fact that it doesn’t have any strict requirements for one to get the job, it is expected to earn minimum wage, but some believe that one should make around 17$/hr from the tips. If the minimum wage should increase, then what about the inflation? This isn’t a serious topic, but I thought that it was an interesting idea. I would like to clarify that I do not live in the US.

Edit: I see that inflation isn’t an issue. Then we can ignore this argument.",vne373,"So in many places the minimum wage is not a livable wage, it cannot pay for all the necessities of modern life (clothing, rent, food, bills, internet access, medical care) without some other type of support, ie food banks, government assistance, support from family/friends.

When you say ""I think X job should be paid less than a livable wage"" while also believing that the job should exist (I assume you want restaurants to exist so you can eat out), you are saying that in your ideal world, where everything is exactly as it should be, there are people with full time jobs struggling to make ends meet.

Commercial outbound call centers should be illegal.,"In the modern telecommunications landscape, I fail to see any legitimate business purpose for outbound call centers. They are at best an annoyance, and at worst criminal scam operations.

It's my view that it should be made illegal for any U.S. commercial entity to operate or employ an outbound call center. Contracting with centers in other countries should be illegal as well. Inbound call centers - like tech support - are fine. Companies found in violation should face large fines. 

A company can reach customers for business or marketing purposes just fine via post or email. If I could snap my fingers and enact this into law, I'd support an implementation period to allow companies that use call centers to plan and execute their transition away. CMV!",dsk9vn,"&gt; In the modern telecommunications landscape, I fail to see any legitimate business purpose for outbound call centers. 

If B2C outbound telemarketing didn't work to get new customers, they wouldn't do it.  You failing to see that is irrelevant.

We have a Do Not Call list in this country, and legit businesses, by and large, observe that. There are often class actions when a legit business steps over the line, so we have a law and enforcement.  After you're on the DNC list, the inbound calls that you get, whether they originate from the U.S. or outside, are by and large criminals by definition.  We have a law that tells them to stop, they don't.  Adding another law won't help.

So, in short, it doesn't matter how many times you make these types of calls or call centers illegal, the calls will continue to come, which I believe is your ultimate goal, to stop the telemarketing calls.

Now putting the carriers on the hook for fines for delivering calls without certified caller-id information, that's something to talk about.  Call blockers work alot better when they can't fake the caller-id.",f6q6gf3,2.8
Art is a young man's/woman's game,"Strong opinion weakly held

I believe art is not a life sport. I think there are certain pursuits you can develop over lifetime and continue to improve. Artisanship (craft)? Sure, that grows with age if you're in good enough health. But art itself is a young man's/woman's game. 

To me, art is a combination of 3 things: creative intelligence, cultural relevance, and skill

1. **Types of intelligence**: People who study intelligence have differentiated 2 kinds of intelligence, [fluid and crystalized](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/fluid-and-crystallized-intelligence). As we age we can improve in crystallized intelligence but we worsen at fluid intelligence. That fluid intelligence is directly relevant to creative intelligence. 

1. **Empirically, older artists are rarer and worse**: There's a paucity of artists as age increases. Most significant artists achieve their peak before age 45. While commercial success can often come later, an artists relevance generally fades by 50. 

1. **Conservativism comes at the expense of art**: [as people get older, they get more conservative ](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/conservative-with-age-why-your-political-stripes-change-over-time-1.4442808) and not just politically. As you get more successful/established, it becomes more expensive to take risks.

Open container laws are entirely too broad,"In California, an open container of alcohol is defined under statute as follows:

&gt; 23222 (a) No person shall have in his or her possession on his or her person, while driving a motor vehicle upon a highway or on lands… any bottle, can, or other receptacle, containing any alcoholic beverage which has been opened, or a seal broken, or the contents of which have been partially removed.

The law explicitely states that occupants of the vehicle may have *no* open container in the vehicle, regardless of circumstances. I don't know about any of you, but I often buy a bottle of liquor and drink it slowly over days, weeks or even months. It's also perfectly reasonable to me that one might want to transport a bottle that's been partially drank to another location for a get-together with friends and/or family. 

Personally, this reeks of ""probable cause"" bait for police officers, when they might not have any otherwise. I don't see a scenario where it's an issue if I were to transport open liquor out of reach from the drivers seat, and yet the law says that it's unacceptable. 

I've viewed other state statutes and they've all seen similarly worded, with some exceptions (Like Texas) allowing it in the trunk area or last seat if there is no trunk.",hp4o5j,"The appellate court in  People v. McCloskey (Cal. Super. 1990) 226 Cal.App.3d Supp. 5  clarified 23222 VC doesn't apply if the container is in the trunk.

Also,  Cal. Veh. Code § 23225(a)(1) ""It is unlawful for the registered owner of any motor vehicle to keep in a motor vehicle, when the vehicle is upon any highway or on lands, as described in subdivision (c) of Section 23220, any bottle, can, or other receptacle containing any alcoholic beverage that has been opened, or a seal broken, or the contents of which have been partially removed, **unless the container is kept in the trunk of the vehicle.”** *\[Emphesis added\]*

Besides, if it's in the trunk, how is it probable cause bait?

Lastly, the California state legislature originally enacted 23222 (as its original statute) in like 1959. They've had 61 years to right this particularly overly broad statute. They never do. They just add more. And more. And more. And more.

"There should be an age requirement of 18 or 21 to have a kid, like drinking, voting, driving etc.","Recently, I read a horrific article about an incident in Wisconsin where a 16 year old got his 14 year old girlfriend pregnant, and after the baby was born, shot the baby twice in the head and left her for dead in a tree stump.  This type of situation isn’t a once off event either, if you read the news, you can routinely hear cases about the body of a newborn baby being discovered, and often the mother is a teenager.  I’m not in any way arguing that teen parents are more likely to abuse their children as opposed to older parents, however statistics have shown that being born to young or teenage parents.  Being born to teenage parents often increases the likelihood of remaining in poverty, and obtaining a subpar level of education.  There are also physical effects, babies born to teenage mothers are at a higher risk of lower birth rate, and moms are at risk of blood pressure issues and kidney problems.  There are numerous mental issues, teenage parents are at a much higher risk for depression and suicidal thoughts.  

The core issue is people that young are generally unprepared to take on the responsibilities of raising children, both being mentally prepared and materialistically prepared.  Highschool students generally rely on their parents for and overwhelming majority of their needs, employment opportunities are heavily restricted, with mainly minimum wage work open to them.  Young people also have very limited life experience to draw on, and are still figuring the world out.  We have age restrictions on numerous activities because of this.  You have to be 16 to get your license, 18 to move out, vote and be considered a legal adult, and 21 to drink.  We view people under 21 not mature enough to understand the risks and effects of alcohol, which is why we have that age limit. 

Certainly a beer or a ballot don’t require anywhere close to the same level of responsibility parenting and children require, so why aren’t kids included in these age requirements? There should be much greater access to contraception, birth control, abortion and sterilization for young people, adding an age restriction would force increased access to pregnancy prevention.  

Having children is an incredible lifestyle choice that can totally change your life.  It requires an upmost level of maturity and responsibility to undertake which most teenagers aren’t mature enough or have the resources to undertake.",lgf0c8,So is the idea to force teen moms to have abortions?

It should be illegal for parents to have their children circumcised,"There are usually two reasons people put forward to justify mutilating an infant's genitals:

- Because it's more ""hygienic"" that way

- Because my religious book/authority says I should do it

Let's pick those two apart shall we?

- No one in their right mind would say that mutilation is an acceptable way of keeping good hygiene. We don't pluck people's fingernails so they don't get dirt under them or remove their scalps so they don't get lice and smell bad. If you teach your kid to  wash his penis and wear a condom when he's old enough, there is no reason to chop off his foreskin for the sake of ""hygiene"". 

- If you argue that it's within your religious freedom to practice circumcision, I'd agree to the extent that you should be allowed to do it to yourself, BUT NOT TO YOUR CHILD. As a matter of fact, having your kid participate in any religious ritual should be illegal, but that's a topic for a different CMV. Imagine this, one day you travel abroad and become gravely ill, to the point of being in a coma. When you wake up, a group of people tell you: Hey, we thought you weren't gonna make it so we shaved your head and gave you some ritualistic tattoos because that's what we do in our religion. Wouldn't that make you feel violated?

- Lastly, if we as a society agree that people should be in control of their own bodies we cannot justify the genital mutilation of people who do not consent to it. There's a reason why all western countries have banned Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), it's a horrible practice that deprives women of sexual pleasure for no good reason. It's the same thing with male circumcision, the nerve endings on the foreskin contribute to sexual pleasure and removing the foresking because God or because hygiene is not a good reason at all. 

My view is that the only reason why circumcision is still legal is because if any one politician actively campaigned against it, his political party would lose a bunch of religious peoples' votes, that's it. It's legal because no political party wants to pay the price to make things right.",nycakk,"I don't agree with circumcising babies, but the one legitimate, scientifically backed purpose is for reducing the spread of HIV.

we must separate the art from the artist," “For me, it’s a false dichotomy because this question presupposes we should want our artists to be virtuous, and that we should expect morality and ethical behavior from artists. I don’t understand why we expect that or why we should expect that,” says Hayes-Brady. “Whatever you think about David Foster Wallace \[[**who stalked and abused Mary Karr**](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/the-world-still-spins-around-male-genius/559925/)\], it is certainly the case that he is a cultural touchstone. \[His work\] was important at a particular moment. As such, that justifies spending time studying it, in critical and challenging ways with a critical eye.” \[-Excerpt from the article\] 

I'm going to be honest, my first stance was that we should not separate the art from artists because it's irresponsible to sever the skills and the morality of an artist. It's a huge slap on the face of the victims and it does not do any service to us to tolerate their behavior just because they did monumental work. I thought that that same line of reasoning will justify dictators building monumental projects at the expense of the death of other people. 

But it also made me question, how about extremely monumental works? I.e. some political thinkers before subscribed to slavery and misogyny yet we voraciously read their works because it is fundamental in understanding political systems. I believe that if the contribution is fundamental to the development of the field, the work of art must be severed from the artist.

Even artists can commit this mistake by trying to make their art about a blatant ""message."" It can and will backfire.

Intersectionality and Identity politics are standing in the way of progress for the left,"I'm a socialist. I believe that we need to fight corporate power and economic inequality and build a society where the economy is democratically controlled by working people and where the capitalist class no longer exists or holds power. In the short term I also support any and all efforts to increase the economic power of the working class through intermediate measures like Single Payer Healthcare, Supporting unions and unionization, and establishing public banks and municipal control of utilities.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When I refer to progress for the left, I refer to progress on these goals specifically because these are the goals are important to me and the ones that many on the left claim to support and advocate for. I understand that some might define progress differently but that's not what I'm trying to discuss here. What I'm specifically trying to discuss is progress towards these goals and why I think the current methods of the left are standing in the way of it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

These are goals that many on the left claim to agree with and support but I find that a lot of the time their methods tend to be counterproductive at best and actively harmful at worst. Specifically what I'm referring to here is the idea of intersectionality and the corresponding prevalance of identity politics in the modern left. For context when I refer to intersectionality here I'm referring specifically to the idea that all forms of percieved social oppression (race, gender, class, sexual orientation, etc.) are linked and coequal and when I refer to identity politics I'm referring to the idea that people should organized based on social groups (such as race, gender, etc.) rather than based around shared economic struggles such as the common need of all workers for good healthcare and wages.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

These two ideas pose a problem for the economic liberation of the working class because they effectively stand in the way of anyone who attempts to organize based around economic issues and class and derail them into irrelevance. Every time someone attempts to address healthcare or economic inequality they always seem to constantly get browbeaten into allocating literally equal time and resources to racism and trans issues and homophobia and whatever other unique forms of social oppression that some mob of college students with bullhorns care deeply about, until in the end nothing gets done. Occupy was probably the best example of this in recent history but this can be seen with pretty much every attempt to organize around class or economic struggles in recent history, especially in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that racism and other \*isms are real issues that matter to a lot of people but imo that doesn't really give small minorities the right to effectively derail progress for everyone else until their own personal issues are all solved. And from my perspective that's pretty much what I keep seeing happen; Black people or gay people or trans people or whoever basically holding everyone else's healthcare hostage because they don't yet have everything they want.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The end result of this is that class and economic issues are constantly getting sidelined because everyone needs to ""shut up and listen"" to whoever's deemed less privileged than them which leads to a scenario where social progress keeps advancing (but never quite enough) while economic inequality continues to rise and the majority of working people (not unjustly) think that the left doesn't care about them because they're not oppressed enough and wind up supporting people like Trump who at least do a better job of pretending to give a shit than the woke leftists who spend 90 percent of their time talking about pronouns and microagressions.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Am I wrong here? I realize that I hold what is by far the minority opinion at least in the US, but I just can't see the logic of the left emphasizing intersectionality and identity politics as much as it does.

"Congressional apportionment is in dire need of a revisit. The US should have, as of 2019, 690 members of congress, not 535.","[Congressional apportionment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_congressional_apportionment) is the the most glaring failure currently of the republic.

Most other countries can be seen to follow the ""cube root rule"" (by design or because that's the way the statute ended up working) by which the apportionment of representation is a function of the cube root of the total population.

&gt;For example, the voting-age population was 203,578,000 in 1990, and the whole number closest to being the cube root of that population is 588 (588 x 588 x 588 = 203,297,472). Although that formula tracked the size of the House fairly well between 1790 and 1910, the discrepancy between the current House size and the “cube root of population” rule is so great that restoring that relationship would require adding more than 150 members to the House.

After 1910 (when congress last meaningfully added seats before 1929 when it was capped for good) we see the rise of the oligarchy in earnest. They were no longer burdened by the will of the people, and meaningful measures to reign in corporate influence over government were all but abandoned, since power was only getting more concentrated.

The GDP and especially the tax revenue of the nation was more concentrated as the population grew, leading to the abuses we saw for the first time in the 20th century, and will continue to see as population grows but representation does not.

"Family is just biological, I don’t have to like them","Just because someone is related to you through blood, doesn’t mean you have to get along with them or like them. You be forced to get along with siblings or other close family because they are “family”, but certain traditions state that family is the most important thing in life. I think that isn’t the case, as you should be able be free from any tradition to maintain a relationship with any family. This primarily concerns any and all family you are immediately related/raised with, meaning that it can also mean adopted or unrelated family that you are raised with, if that makes sense. Despite this, I can already see a flaw in this view, that my personal experience could affect my view, but isn’t that the point where all views originate, from personal experience? 

Back to the point,  one shouldn’t be ethically pressured into the entire “family” ideology, just because someone spent a large majority of their upbringing with their sibling etc. doesn’t meant that they shouldn’t be able to walk away from them. 

There are already a lot of flaws, such as the family POV or the point that if someone was open about this matter to that family, then the issue could possibly resolved, however it shouldn’t then be mandatory to continue “acting” (in a sense) that the previous years with that family had never occurred and that individual wasn’t as big on the family idea as others.

The best time to be born was in the mid 20th century and it will never be rivaled,"The middle of the 20th century saw the end of the war for the nations involved in the war. Independence for the countries under colonial rule and democracies cropping up in many countries.

Being born in this post war era, where people were anti-war and determined to improve the quality of life and live their life to the fullest has been the best time to be alive in all of human civilization. I will talk about the factors taken into consideration, especially in comparison to today where definitely life seems to be much more improved than before

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Life :** People born post war had  greater chance of survival and with better nutrition. A lot of the foods we take for granted today received widespread distribution in this era. Countries also started looking at other nations to end world hunger etc unlike previously where countries were mostly confined to the welfare of their own citizens.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Science :** Most of the scientific development took place at the end of the 19th century to early 20th century; meaning by the mid 20th century most of the scientific findings were commercialised, with regular folks taking advantage of it like electricity, television, radio, personal vehicles etc. This is for the regular folks.For scientists too this was an era of the greatest development and progress. A lot of new discoveries were made and it was an exciting era for the field of science. Even medical research.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Medical advancement :** A lot of people do not realise the horrors that our previous generations faced with regards to infections. The antibiotic era was a life saver and along with industrialisation and fertilizer based farming was one of the major contributers for the advancement of human lifespan and quality of life. People would simply die of many preventable diseases previously and then the discovery of antibiotics in this era saved many lives.Now how is this point relevant? Well we are seeing the end of the antibiotic era. Because of unscientific usage of antibiotics, a lot of resistance has set in, in the bacteria, which has led to a lot of exteremely drug resistant strains taking permanent residence in hospitals etc. Soon we won't have a cure in around half a century for most preventable diseases like cholera today.People born after the 1950s, lived in the golden period of the antibiotic era and now are at the tail end of their life, just when everything is going downhill.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Technology :** One could argue and even say this is boomer logic that technology existed in the right balance for the human convenience in this period. Starting from radios, to televisions, electrical appliances, motorised tools, personal vehicles; everything existed that made life easy. But wasn't so pervasive to reduce the human experience.Today we are more connected than ever but we hardly speak to our neighbours, family members or siblings etc for online validation from strangers. Every convenience or over convenience in the form of door step deliveries etc has made humans lazier than ever, thus contributing to severe mental and physical health problems.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Cost of living :** The cost of living was also low and people lived in big houses and had large families with decent jobs. Something a CEO would own today was owned by a supervisor in the 60s. Even people with three degrees and a well paying job cannot confidently look at buying their own home or retire comfortably without being defeated by inflation. Housing was cheap. Food was organic. Oil was cheap.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Simplicity :** People were simple and it was easy to be good and not be exploited in those days. Sure there were outliers everywhere. But today being honest is seen as being foolish, being cunning is seen as a trait that will climb you the corporate ladder faster. People were generally nice to each other, helped each other and there was a sense of community in those days. This has eroded slowly over the years due to rapid urbanization where ""every man for himself"" attitude is the norm.

&amp;#x200B;

**7. No pollution, no exploitation, no global warming :** Even thought the roots for todays problems were sown in this era, the era itself was mostly devoid of any of the mentioned problems. The population was also much lower and there was less resource requirements in this era. No microplastics in the ocean, no global warming, no unpredictable weather, no exploitation of resources etc

Group projects should be discontinued from Schools.," 

I mainly referring to High Schools, GradeSchools and Middle schools. I feel there is no point in group project anymore, sure its a great way to pond and learn about teamwork but the students make it so difficult. Most of the time you would be paired up with lazy bums who will look for any reason to not do their part, some would refuse to even meet to discuss and when presentation day comes, they'll come up pretending like they did something and if you dear tell the truth to the teacher about the people who actually did their work, the whole class goes against you because no one likes a teacher sucking Snitch.

Which leads to the another reason why I feel group project don't work anymore and that the social's aspect of it, especially if your force to pick a group. Now this is more complicated but being forced to pick a group can be damaging to a kid who suffers from some form of anxiety, other students will obviously pick their friends or who ever is more popular in that grade then your left alone, once other students find out your alone they think your alone for a reason, that they didn't pick you because no one likes you thus telling everyone else to avoid you outside of class because people start spreading rumors. Or when the teacher forces you to join a certain group they treat you like shit. I Know I'm exaggerating but High school and Middle schools students can be very nasty to one and other, and this experiences can affect someone to there adult hood.

In Short I just feel Group project don't help student with social anxiety and it in fact make it worse because other student's aren't willing to help or make it easier ,in fact they make it harder because they don't understand anxiety or any other mental illness. Or The fact that students who are to liked and popular can get away with not doing anything because other kids always put up with their shit and saying something makes you the bad guy",eb8n2d,they should instead be reworked into something that grades the individual contributions rather than the whole product.,fbd658u,2.75
I believe humans from West Africa and their descendants are the best fast twitch athletes in the world,"West Africa and its descendants show the most success in sports that require fast twitch explosiveness football, basketball, sprinting ect. I believe genetically they are the most talented. This isn't because their skin color is black but I may be wrong and maybe it's a contributing factor but in Africa or other populations of dark skinned humans like the tall lanky Sudanese and short pygmy people in Africa don't possess a high average of fast twitch explosiveness countries outside of West Africa when West Africans migrated too like Jamaica, North America and Haiti all have on average higher fast twitch explosive athleticism compared to the rest of the population. There is no white or Asian Wilt Chamber, Shaq or LeBron James.

We only had airplanes for a short time in our human history and I believe that West Africans evolved to be more athletic on average because of happenstance, sexual selections and/or the environment. Africa has lions, cheetahs, crocodiles and many apex predators. If an animal attacks a group of West African tribes members maybe the one who takes off the fastest in the group survives and passes their genes. Maybe this is the reason they are such good sprinters with the last no African sprinter winning the Olympics in the 1980s I believe and he was on PEDs iirc. Or maybe woman selected for more athletic men and being more athletic helped them find mates. Humans evolve to their environment and like I mentioned before we haven't had airplanes to spread genes as far wide as we can today. That's why humans near the equator are darker to help protect from the sun and why humans in colder climates evolved lighter skin to absorb vitamin D better when those parts of the world have less sunlight. 

West Africans iirc on average have bigger hearts which probably helps with athleticism and larger nostrils on average which help with breathing oxygen especially in hotter climates. They also sweat less in the sun because of the darker skin so maybe this helps them avoid dehydration and allows them to do vigorous physical activity for longer in the sun which may translate to their athleticism. West Africans on average also have long limbs compared to their torso which gives them a lower center of gravity which helps them with running faster. I believe humans from other parts of the world can be great fast twitch explosive athletes but on average West Africa has the most. Which explains why they dominate these kind of sports. 

And just to make sure for people who think this is racist I'm not saying they are more athletic on average because they are black because Africa has over 1 billion people and not every country produces athletes like West Africa does so I'm not saying all Africans are like this. Matter a fact according to scientic Africa is the most genetically diverse continent in the world. And I'm not saying they are more athletic because they are black but I'm also not opposed to it being a possible contributing factor.",kv4la8,"While your title is generally agreed on by scholars as far as I'm aware, dam you wrote the post weird, including some errors.

More money and research needs to be put into providing a male birth control,"The saying goes:

To avoid being shot would you rather remove the bullets from a gun or wear a bullet proof vest?

I think the same attitude should be embraced with birth control. Men should be able to have more than just condoms as a choice for birth control.

Condoms restrict the pleasure both men and women can have during sex. Most men do not like the idea of wearing a condom so the job of birth control falls on the woman. The shitty side effects, fucking up you body and the cost of birth control is thrown into the woman's court.

I think we need to have a male option (pill etc) so that we can share the load of birth control. Women constantly have to put up with shitty side effects of birth control, screw with their bodies and fork out the money for these items but men are left with no other option but a condom. Men need to be able to take control of their own bodies and prevent an unwanted pregnancy. No more ""I'm pregnant because the condom broke"" or lies about pregnancy because the man would be on his own birth control.

EVERYONE needs to be responsible for their own birth control. And men need the option to be responsible for their own sexual health.

"The LGBT+ community should embrace using multiple flags, rather than trying to squeeze everything onto a single flag","In the words of Hannah Gadsby, the pride flag is ""a bit busy"". While I am 100% in favour of the explicit inclusion of trans, NB, and ace people, and LGBT+ of all races, I do think that trying to fit it all onto a single flag is impractical. I agree with the affirmative support, just not the decision to put it all on a single flag. When I see the all-inclusive LGBT+ flag I'm reminded of [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnv5iKB2hl4) on the principles of flag design. 

There is precedent in other areas already; in England, county halls might fly the county flag *and* the UK flag, rather than trying to combine them into one. US states, and EU nations do something similar for some of their government buildings.

If you want to specifically show support for black LGBT+ people, then fly a black power flag alongside the LGBT+ flag. 

One option to keep it all on a single flag would be a complete redesign, however, then you'd lose the significance and cultural clout of the current one. So, I'm not sure how that would work.

I also worry a little bit that the additions to the flag imply that the original flag, and those who use it, don't support those groups, and lead to a balkanising of the LGBT+ community, when what is needed is more unity, not less. However, this is something I come and go on anyway.

**EDIT:** There seems to be some confusion about my suggestion. What I'm proposing is that the 6 bar rainbow flag be kept as the overarching banner, and subgroups within it can then fly their flag *alongside* the pride flag.",u1cnd3,"The LGBTQ+ does have multiple flags.

Increasing taxes on the ultra wealthy in the US won't make things better for the rest of the population.,"My stance/argument is fairly simple, the US currently has enough money from the taxes it does collect to accomplish a shit ton of things. Particularly the things that most proponens of tax increase are fighting for *(universal healthcare, cheaper regulated or free colleges, corporate regulation, etc.)* This is Evidenced by the fact that we have extremely large military budgets, foreign aid dollars, tax subsidies and the list goes on where hundred of billions of dollars goes towards while other programs continually get budget cuts. 

Increasing taxes on the billionaires, while it should still happen, won't make a difference in the social policies put in place because money isn't the issue... corruption and lobbying powers who influence where the dollars actually go is the issue. 

If taxes increased in the wealthy, I believe the extra money would be used to just continue to do more of what we're already doing which is cutting social programs and having legislation that appeals to the largest and most powerful lobbying groups. CMV.",w2th4s,"Maybe because I'm an MMTer (can explain more if you want), the whole ""taxpayer dollar"" argument is tired. The justice in taxing the rich is you shift the tax burden away from the middle class and towards people who had a lower marginal propensity to consume (I.e. rich people who would put additional dollars into savings, investments, or buying luxury goods etc). And when people talk about taxing the rich, it's rarely about income tax. The income tax argument is usually a strawman from the Right. It's usually speculation taxes, windfall taxes, capital gains taxes, all things that are taxed relatively low so that the middle and lower class bear a disproportionately higher tax burden.",igtcnj7,3.5
Lip Botox injections are an awful practice. Destroys face symmetry making a person uglier not prettier.,"I recently moved to Kiev Ukraine. There is a growing trend of women getting all sorts of minor cosmetic surgeries to enhance their look. Now I get that I may just be noticing the ""bad jobs"". But holy smokes it is down right sad what some of these women do to their face. It's not just the lips. They usually have a pattern. Lips that look like they are fish not human, a nose that is too small for their face and turned upwards, and something with their eyebrows that looks very unnatural. That look is very common here. My reaction is almost always ""I bet she was attractive before she did all that bullshit"".   


My wife dragged me to do a pregnancy photo shoot at an expensive studio yesterday. I guess this is where a lot of models come to get shoots done. I saw two girls walk in that had this awful look. The worst part is I could tell they were very attractive BEFORE THEY DID THE SURGERIES. Now they hardly look human. Their sexual appeal has vanished.  


As I said before I get that I may just be noticing the bad jobs. I may also have a stronger disgust to non human stuff than an average male. I know there is a whole sub of guys who fetish those awful fish lips on reddit. I'm guessing those guys are major outliers though. I also understand how women get hooked on this stuff. I've had bouts of anorexia in my life. You get addicted to the improvement and you ""improve"" way past the point where no further improvement can be made. When you lose weight at one point you can't make yourself look better by losing weight only worse.

"God didn't stop humans from sinning, and so Christians have no business using God's will to justify trying to do the same","According to the Bible, God didn't prevent Adam and Eve from taking the fruit from the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil, nor he prevented the serpent from entering the Garden of Eden. While humans were told not to sin, there were no obstacles to the sin. This was probably to allow the humans to exercise their freedom of will, which is an important idea in Christianity.

It should therefore be wrong to appeal to God's will while attempting to restrict people from sinning, e.g. by banning abortion. It just goes against the “spirit” of Genesis. CMV!

P.S. Don't get me wrong, nothing prevents us from outlawing bad things per se, there are other sources of law.

P.P.S. An obvious counterargument to this would be many examples of God punishing people for their sins. I honestly don't know what to make of this, but most Christians I talked to still consider this “free will”—after all, you still can sin? Anyways, this doesn't seem to be voiding the idea of free will, so unless there's more to it, I'll leave this aside for the time being.",g5hmvj,"I suppose you are right that people have free will to sin according to the Bible. You see people sin again and again throughout the bible, and kind of the whole point of Jesus is to forgive people for sinning, but that doesn't mean that he approved of it.

God laid out an entire system of law in Exodus and Leviticus telling the Israelites exactly what to do and not to do, and the temple system was set up around this. It was illegal to murder and rape and all of that during the biblical times just as it was today.

I don't understand exactly what the difference between making laws outlawing certain things and restricting access. All laws are there to enforce a certain moral position which is what the banning of abortions is about. I don't see a difference between that and the system of law that God set up in the Bible.

And going back to the abortion thing, abortions still happened long before it was legal. You can outlaw it and close down abortion clinics, but it would be next to impossible to actually stop all abortions because there would be a black market for it. 

And also, parts of the bible tell Christians to not cause one another to stumble. (Romans 14) Since many Christians do believe that Abortion is a sin, having it legal and sanctioned is what they see as Causing a brother to stumble. Even if closing the clinic wouldn't stop every abortion, it would be a condemnation of the act.",fo49hc7,4.2
Being fat/obese/significantly overweight is a choice and should be frowned upon,"EDIT:  **CMV: Being fat/obese/significantly overweight is a choice** **~~and should be frowned upon~~**

&amp;#x200B;

For the sake of this, we will assume that one metric is used and that it is not discouraged/frowned upon.

With recent events exposing massive health problems in our country (USA), it reminded me of obesity and how it is something major and needs to be tackled. From my current understanding, it is a choice. I'm going to put some of the major points into short paragraphs. This can probably be broken up into 2 separate sections, pre-obesity and post-obesity, but I lumped them together. Additionally, I am discussing the AVERAGE human, not somebody with 15 rare conditions that grew up in poverty.

1. Education - While some people may not have proper education on exact specifics in health, it seems weird to me that they would have none at all. Everyone I've grown up has had some sort of ""health class"" starting at a relatively young age. If that was not done, then by the time people were in high school they had received some form of formal food &amp; exercise recommendations.
2. Family Environments - Similar to the above, people may have even been encouraged to partake in unhealthy behaviors. Eating extra sweets, not exercising, etc. At some point, the education should kick in and go away with this.
3. ""Personal Choice"" - When people say they don't care that they're obese, I believe it's either lying to themselves or they don't realize it. There are many situations in life where obesity takes a toll. Mentally, physically, socially, etc. This would also imply that it IS their choice.
4. Money - This is probably a super legitimate issue. Most of the foods accessible by super low income is not very healthy. I'm sure with enough exercise, this could be overcome.
5. Time - If you say you don't have enough time, you're probably lying. There are things you can do to free up time and/or things during the day that can help burn calories (shaking leg, weighted vests, etc).
6. Mental health - Exercising releases endorphins. It should be used to combat mental health problems, not be a reason to not exercise. Understandably, some people might view it as mentally/physically taxing when already obese, but it can be overcome and could have also been addressed earlier.

7 - Physical deficiencies - Just because you have to work harder does not mean it is not possible. Choosing to not overcome the difficulties makes it a choice again. Unless there is a condition that instantly causes you to be obese from birth and unable to lose fat (does this exist?), then it would still be a choice.

This is downplaying it a bit, but I feel these are the major categories that people try and use to defend their position and reasons for being overweight. I would argue that this is a serious issue because being obese may result in the offspring, family, or other humans to then be obese due to ideologies, lifestyles, etc. Additionally, it will take many vital personnel out of the work force / add unnecessary stress when they inevitably suffer complications due to their obesity. Additionally, it worsens any scenarios like diseases, disasters, and makes everyday life more complicated.

Sorry for rambling a bit / not structuring a proper argument, just wanted to get this out there so that I can respond for a bit. I probably left a few things out so will likely edit / discuss in comments.",fwzl9u,"I agree with you to an extent, but I think your part on ""education"" is a little flawed. While people are educated in the *effects* of obesity, there's not much education in the *neuroscience* of over-eating. You should check out a book called ""The hungry brain"" by Stephan J. Guyenet, which details the effects on the brain of calorie-dense foods. He uses the term ""evolutionary mismatch"" - that we evolved to find foods like nuts and meat delicious because they have such high amounts of calories packed into small quantities (which was an evolutionary benefit to pre-agrarian humanity) , but now we live in a world where anyone can go to the 7/11 and consume 5000 calories for $20, this part of our brain is actually a hindrance. Couple this with the billions of dollars the food industry spends on making their products as delicious as possible and you see the problem we have. 

So to call it a ""choice"" is technically true, but also downplays the *weight* of the choices available - do you see? People aren't just choosing to be obese - they're fighting against their hindbrains and the entire food industry itself.",fmre7w1,4.4
The ability to fly is OBVIOUSLY a better superpower than the ability to become invisible,"Disclaimers: 

1) I'm not really interested in debating the nuances of how the superpowers would work. Let's just go for the simplest definition: you can engage in either superpower whenever you want, and there are no weird tricks or complications. 

2) Let's not get stuck up on edge cases. I'm sure that, for a certain hypothetical person, the ability to become invisible would be more useful. But I'm talking in general terms here. 

3) To clearly define the question: ""which superpower would bring the most overall joy to the recipient?""

OK so I can kinda see (hehe) the appeal of becoming invisible. But the benefits all seem to (inherently!) involve deceiving other people in some way. What can I do with invisibility? I can sneak around, I can spy on people, I can hide, I can eavesdrop. Fine, great, but I don't have a particularly burning desire to do any of those things! They're all a bit unsavoury and, frankly, petty. We can think bigger, guys. 

What can I do with flight? I could travel anywhere, for free, quickly. I could wake up every morning and soar around in the dawn's light, floating around with the birds, seeing the world from an entirely new perspective, feeling the rush of the air against my skin. At night, I could float among the stars and the clouds, looking down at the villages and cities and farms and beaches and all the twinkling lights and all the little people. How fucking glorious does that sound? 

Obviously this post is inspired by that classic ""would you rather..."" question. It genuinely blows my mind that so many people answer ""invisibility"". I think that answer is insanely wrong. But a large proportion of people seem to disagree with me and I want to understand why that is.",u3s0bm,"&gt;They're all a bit unsavoury and, frankly, petty. We can think bigger, guys.

I think you're not thinking big enough. Flying is very limited in what you can do. You fly, that's it. I'm not sure if you've noticed, but if you get higher, it's really cold really fast. You'll always have windburn (unless physics don't apply) and all sorts of other negatives. 

Invisibility can make you wealthy and powerful, which in turn can bring a lot of happiness. With enough wealth, you can more or less do what you want when you want.

Prescribing puberty blockers for transgender youth is incredibly dangerous and should not be done as liberally as people say,"Recently the NHS banned puberty blockers for kids under 16 years old looking to transition to the opposite gender. In response to this ruling, there has been social media backlash (in particular on Instagram) saying that these puberty blockers are ""completely reversible"" and that ""trans youth should be able to make these decisions over their own body""

Without mentioning that one can present as the opposite gender WITHOUT hormonal treatment and puberty blockers, these medications are far from as benign as people say they are. Although the idea that they're ""completely reversible"" holds SOME water, there's not enough evidence to support that there's not profound changes in their mental development.

Beyond that, these medications (such as Lupron) were never designed or properly tested for this use. They have immense side effects and should not be taken lightly.

I do believe SOME transgender people under 16 know for sure and this could benefit them, but at the end of the day most kids under the age of 16 have no idea what they're getting themselves into. Puberty blockers may help transition however at the end of the day they're not a strict requirement, and i personally would rather be safe than sorry with something like this.",o6bf41,"&gt; i personally would rather be safe than sorry with something like this.

Historical shows casting should focus on being accurate not diversity,"There is many examples of Netflix doing this but in this instance am talking about the show Bridgerton. Where the show is based on the elite class romance around the Victorian era Britain. 

As a history vivid reader what am witnessing is a naive attempt to eradicate facts and brainwash new generation that diversity existed in that era. In paper that sounds as the right thing to do to make new generation more accepting of diversity subconsciously. 

However in doing such thing it makes a statement that racism did not exist in that era in Victorian Britain and that dark brown and east Asian minorities where British aristocrats. 

Even though it’s considered fiction it is still bound by the historical social context it set itself inside. 

You might not care as you view this as fiction romance.Nevertheless, the subconscious implications are massive and drastic if this continues. As this sorta ignores or tries to hide the colonialism that happened in that era, and almost tried to hide all the struggle Ghandi and Martin Luther king did to advance the ideas of racial equality. 

If am seeing for example a Bollywood historical drama I would cringe if I see a person from east Asia represent the Indian elite romance. Another example imagine how ridiculous it would be to make a romance set in the Wild West era with a diverse cast acting as if racial discrimination did not happen. 

Please don’t understand this the wrong way. Diversity isn’t my issue. Feel free to have diverse cast that represent the future or the modern world. But forcing diversity in historical fiction is beyond arrogant and naive.",kkwq7i,"“Historical shows” is not one genre. There are documentary movies and plays where accuracy is important. But there are also “docudrama” types or historical novels. These are fictional works based on historical facts. But the entire story is made up. 

Also remember that most historical Hollywood movies are inaccurate, when screenwriters and directors add scenes to spice up the movie and attract viewers. 

Then there are historical comedies like Monty Python movies. Everything is designed to make us laugh. 

Is 300 Spartans accurate? And if not, why doesn’t it bother you? And what about the Bridge on River Kwai? Is Laurence of Arabia accurate? The list goes on and on.

Pete Buttigieg is correct that Bernie Sanders' medicare for all plan has a 50 trillion dollar price tag that simply cannot be explained away.,"He challenged Bernie on this twice during the debate last night, and Bernie did not challenge the assertion, or give any new explanation to explain the massive gap. I found a transcript of the exchange, here it is:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;PETE: But I'm actually less concerned about the lack of transparency on Sanders' personal health than I am about the lack of transparency on how to pay for his health care plan, since he's said that it's impossible to even know how much it's going to cost, and even after raising taxes on everybody making $29,000, there is still a multi-trillion-dollar hole.  
&gt;  
&gt;As a matter of fact, if you add up all his policies altogether, they come to $50 trillion. He's only explained $25 trillion worth of revenue, which means that the hole in there is bigger than the size of the entire economy of the United States. The time has come to level with the American people on matters personal and on matters of policy.

...

&gt;BUTTIGIEG: But where is -- where is the other $25 trillion supposed to come from? At a certain point, you've got to do the math.  
&gt;  
&gt;SANDERS: Well, we got it all up there on the internet. It's a payroll tax -- a payroll tax...  
&gt;  
&gt;BUTTIGIEG: Well, no, but even after the payroll tax, you still have a hole.  
&gt;  
&gt;SANDERS: Because we have a wealth tax. Elizabeth has a good one. Ours is a little bit tougher on Mr. Bloomberg than hers. We're going to raise it in a progressive way, which deals with income and wealth inequality, and makes certain, finally, that health care in this country is a human right, not a privilege.

&amp;#x200B;

Elizabeth Warrren has also had a hard time explaining this plan, which is very similar to Bernie's as I understand it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;At the debate, as throughout the campaign, Warren [refused to provide any specifics](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/10/elizabeth-warrens-risky-dodge-health-care-and-taxes/600073/) about how she would fund a single-payer plan. Instead, whether questioned by moderators or challenged by other candidates, she recycled variants on the same talking points she has used in venues from campaign town halls [to a recent appearance on *The Late Show With Stephen Colbert*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Yiga2dDysQ). Rather than explaining what revenue she would raise to fund the plan, Warren insisted that under single payer, middle-income families would save more money with the elimination of health-care premiums, co-pays, and deductibles, regardless of any taxes imposed. “Costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down,” she said at the debate.

It seems pretty clear to me that both Warren and Sanders have a very hard time explaining how they're going to pay for medicare for all. When they're pressed for specifics, or to explain away that 25 trillion dollar gap as Mayor Pete pointed out, they don't have a good answer, or refuse to answer.

In my view, this is damning. Maybe someone can help them out.",f6u6o0,"So you're accepting that the current system doesn't work, and you're fine with people dying and going broke due to medical expenses? Because if you think the current system does a good job and delivers sufficient care, then it shouldn't cost more to move it to single-payer, because there are savings from cutting out the insurance middlemen and from being in a better bargaining position with drug companies and health providers.

If you don't think the current system is effective, then any savings from *not* fixing it (and it really is debatable which is cheaper, but assuming it's cheaper not to fix things) are blood money.

Every other developed country manages, and America is richer per capita than all but a couple tiny developed countries. Why on Earth is this seen as so impossible in the US?

Yes, the *process* of change will be expensive and complicated, but right now you're basically *burning money* with all the inefficiency of dealing with insurance companies, not to mention the cut they take. Getting that out of the equation will be massive savings, and the increased freedom that people will have in the labour market, as well as their ability to afford more preventative and early healthcare, will help the economy.",fi9hprf,3.4

people who are pro-life should also support mandatory organ donation,"One of the core arguments of people who are pro-life regarding abortions is that somebody else right (the unborn child) to survive is more important than the pregnant person's right to make decisions about their own body. 

I believe that people who think this is a convincing argument should also believe that a person's right to survive by receiving a new organ is more important than people's right to decide what happens to their own body after their brain death. 

Both arguments have a very similar structure.

(Personally, I am pro-choice and don't believe that organ donations should be mandatory although I am willing to donate my organs if that should be possible after my death.",vracnh,"I think your argument misses the importance that pro-lifers place on individual responsibility. Many people believe that a pregnant mother who conceives a healthy, unborn child via consensual intercourse has implicitly accepted the responsibility to carry that child to term (barring any serious medical complications). It's not just about the value of the unborn life--it's about the mother's choice to deal with the natural consequences of sexual intercourse. A pro-lifer may believe that a child in utero has some entitlement to the support of a woman's body because the woman voluntarily partcipated in the child's conception. I believe this is the same ethical justification that the State uses to justify garnering an absentee father's wages for child support: the fact that he doesn't want to pay for the child's expenses is irrelevant in the face of his responsibility to it.

The polyamory community has some serious issues.,"I admit right off the bat I have a some personal issues with polyamory but I’m going to do my best to set them aside and mention two major ones outside of myself in particular. 

I’ve noticed, in the years I’ve been around the polyamory community online and off, that there are some problems in it. 

The first is the racism in it. By that I don’t mean the community itself is openly hostile towards nonwhite people, but that’s it is subtly. For example if you see a white woman in it she’s almost sure to be partnered, especially if she fits general Western standards. However women of color, black women especially, are not as likely and will probably be passed up as undesirable. 

The second is the class aspect. Most in the polyamorous community are middle-class/well-to-do/rich people. Not too often will any of them engage with those who aren’t so well off unless they stand to substantially gain from it. 

I’ve tried to mention this on Facebook and…..oh boy. Good thing I couldn’t give a shit about people getting mad because they took it out of context.

Edited one day later: because people clearly are jumping in reflexively and not reading, this has been squashed. Also please stop saying racist things about black people like we’re more likely to be violent. As well, not liking a WHOLE FUCKING RACE of people based off their race alone is literally racist.

"We all just need to cool it, for the sake of our mental health.","Edit: Thanks for my first Gold kind stranger! :)  


I am coming to you as someone with a background in Neuropsychology that is watching our mental health crash and burn, while seeing the habits and pressures we put on ourselves and others that are propelling this vicious cycle to spiral out of control, and no one is calling it out on a mental health perspective. It’s no wonder we’re all socially anxious, depressed, and burnt out so I just want to address a few things here:

&amp;#x200B;

1. \*\*We put way too much weight on peoples words.\*\*I recently read an article on Microagressions. It went over a list of well intended things you may say to others, and what you should say instead (spoiler alert, what you should say instead was always: “nothing”). I think they were confusing a lot of people being socially awkward with being racist, homophobic, or ableist. I read another CMV where they said microagressions are not racist etc., but the article was titled something like “microagressions: things you think are well meaning but are actually sexist or racist”, so they implied that saying things like “I love your hair, is it natural?” is in fact racist. As a Jewish white girl with super curly hair, I can tell you, the amount of times I heard that, and the amount of time people touched my hair, well if only I had a quarter! Like honestly, I think it’s just that curly hair was really uncommonly worn when we were growing up, and I certainly felt like an outcast, struggling a lot with hating my hair, often wearing it straight. People lost their shit when they saw my natural hair. “Is it real!?” No Suzy, I got a perm at 8 years old. And ya people touched it, people went in my personal space, it’s cause it was different, and let’s be real it’s fun to play with the boingy boing. There’s gotta be a point where if that makes you uncomfortable you just assert your boundaries and stop hanging out with that person. Another example was saying “you’re such an inspiration” to a disabled person, and sure maybe that can get annoying to hear all the time when you just want to feel normal and fit in; but as someone with an invisible chronic illness, I wish someone would say I was an inspiration, because for me I ask for a simple accommodation and people think I’m a lazy entitled asshole because my illness is invisible. So being constantly stigmatized is also annoying. But is that a microagression? The world can’t revolve around everyone simultaneously, not everyone is going to know your personal struggles, and everything about your and your culture. You have friends, and you have acquaintances, and you have family, and sometimes people are going to say things that are annoying, or insensitive, and everyone deals with that to some extent. That happens because people form stereotypes as a type of easy heuristic for conversation. It’s like how you meet someone and say “How are you?” And they say “fine” even if they are not. A socially awkward person may just generalize and say something slightly stupid about how you must like basketball cause you’re tall. “HOW’S THE WEATHER UP THERE? HARK HARK HARK” I think the term micro”aggression” is pushing it, it can make people weary of trying to connect with others, or make people feel attacked when it’s just a simple moment of awkwardness. Honestly you might find that you are actually great friends if you get passed two seconds of awkward conversation and not go so deep into it. And when articles also make statements that suggest microagressions are racist or sexist, that’s a tall and vilifying claim, and I think it undermines real racial, sexist, homophobic, and ableist (etc.) discrimination.
2. \*\*We put way too much weight on peoples posts.\*\*So as I mentioned, I am Jewish, born in Israel. I do not agree with Israeli politics one bit (I am super left leaning). I think what they’re doing to Palestinians is down-right awful. However, I blame the corrupt Governments, not the people themselves. During a time of high tension, a friend of mine who is Arab posted a meme that said “let the Israelis get what they deserve” with a picture of a bomb going back onto Israel. Well, obviously I was not too pleased. I was like, dude, that’s not cool I have family there, those are innocent people! We should never vilify the people. I mean, in America Trump is putting Mexicans into camps (which is awful), do we say bomb American people? In China, they are putting Muslims into camps (which is awful), do we say bomb the Chinese people? No. That would be insane. But do I think she’s a horrible anti-Semitic person though? No not really. Do I think she would truly wish me and my family harm? No. Do I think she’s just angry and being reactionary in that moment? Yes. Do I think she saw a meme in a moment when she felt very emotional and shared it? Yes. Do I think it was in poor taste? Yes. In 10 years will someone dig it up and try to get her fired from her job for being anti-Semitic? Jeez, maybe. Would that be more damaging to her life, than it was to my life seeing that meme for 3 seconds? In my opinion, yes. Do I think social media is becoming a space where we sometimes publicly crucify an unlucky commoner for saying something stupid, while we have corrupt Governments actually doing horrible things with no consequences, and it’s a little Medieval-times-ey? Yes.
3. \*\*We put way too much weight on peoples thoughts and feelings.\*\*Ok this one is going to get me murdered and set on fire by the masses but… I see this a lot… Ok… Ok here it goes… This is coming from a Neuropsychological perspective: it is OK to have ANY thought, LITERALLY ANY THOUGHT, no matter how horrible, disgusting, or cruel it is, if you don’t act on it. Let me tell you a bit about obsessive compulsive disorder. It involves unwanted and disturbing thoughts, images, or urges (obsessions) that intrude into a person’s mind which cause a great deal of anxiety or discomfort. Sometimes it can end there (and you can have just obsessive disorder), but other times, the person tries to reduce the thoughts by engaging in repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions). The brain is literally just a random mass of tissue that fires electrical impulses based on memories, imagination, and things you have seen or heard. Which means, you can have horrible thoughts because you saw it in a movie, you were told them by someone else who was horrible, you were traumatized, or even because you think something is so horrible you’re afraid you’ll have it- so you do! OR it could just be random. So imagine telling someone their thoughts make them a bad person, when it’s really their brain processing a random memory- or worse, a traumatic memory they themselves may have experienced - and then putting them in this dreadful position of believing they are a terrible person, and making them feel guilty for feeling the feeling that already makes them feel horrible, and then ostracizing them for seeking help? Well I’ve seen this a lot with people who have never acted on disturbing sexual urges, who have wanted to get help, and then were told they were horrible people. Horrible people for having thoughts they couldn’t control and then getting help? I have to tell people with major anxiety disorder, or emotional perfectionism disorder, “a thought, an idea, or a feeling cannot hurt you” because they are so incredibly afraid of themselves, and this can cause so much internal suffering. Some people with anxiety are driving and feel this “urge” that they’ll lose control and drive into someone, but it’s not really that, it’s that they’re so afraid of losing control they imagine this worst case scenario, but there is actually no danger of it happening. It's OK to have bad thoughts, you may have them because they were learnt from a parent or teacher, from a traumatic experience, or even from a film, YOU ARE NOT YOUR THOUGHTS. You are a series of decisions and actions you make every day. Please do not feel guilty for your thoughts and do not be afraid of your thoughts or feelings. Please DM me if you need a safe space to explore your thoughts and feelings without fear and judgement.
   1. Subset: This is also an issue if you discount a ""white male""'s feelings completely, because at the end of the day it's still going to be dehumanizing. I hear comments such as ""white people/white males (or any other group!) etc. should not have opinions/feelings on matter x y z"" although they certainly shouldn't have the loudest opinion, and they most \*certainly\* should not be making the decisions, you can never tell someone they are not allowed to have feelings, thoughts, or opinions on something. For example, a couple has a baby and the women decides to get an abortion. Ultimately it's her body and her decision, but to suggest that the father cannot be sad because he wanted a baby, to suggest he cannot mourn? That's a form of gaslighting. We are all entitled to our feelings. Feelings are not always ""rational, logical, or correct"", but feelings must be felt to completion, processed, and dealt with personally or they will accumulate and turn into chronic internal discomfort, or even outward aggression. Feel your feelings my dudes! Just make sure you do it in a healthy way, where you do not hurt others, and where you do not excerpt control over others. Be respectful and know when your voices shouldn't be the loudest, but no one should be silenced.

So. In conclusion, I think we’re really pushing it to the point where we’re just going to paralyze people in fear from connecting with anyone, which is the worst thing we could possible do. Humans are an incredibly social species and constant communication, acceptance, and expression are extremely important to our health. Trying to act perfectly all the time requires a lot of mental gymnastics and is actually very exhausting on the brain, even if people don’t realize it. By trying to make every moment in time and space a “safe space”, we are actually making ourselves unsafe to just be the stupid human monkeys we are, just a bunch of animals that talk to each other, eat, procreate, and sleep. We need to be able to talk freely, make mistakes, say stupid things, experiment, see reactions, apologize, and learn. And to be labeled and prosecuted and carry with us every stupid thing we may have said, or might say, is going to cause major social anxiety issues. People really do change and grow, sometimes over years, but also sometimes over days, so do we really need to run ourselves ragged overanalyzing every lyric, post, and conversation? This is not the same as true HATE SPEECH, which we have justifiably made laws against, this is not the same as HATE CRIMES, which we have justifiably made laws against, this is not the same as acts of violence, sexual harassment, abuse, etc. What I’m saying is… There is a line. And I think we are creating more divide because we actually are all the same species. We had other human species and they’re all extinct now. So I don’t know why we’re so insistent on hammering in more division. I think we should stop pointing the finger at one another and judging each other’s actions so harshly, and making them deeper than they are. Can we just all Kumbaya now, focus on the major issues, and fight the real enemy: mosquitos? Jokes it's actually wealth inequality, global warming, police brutality, capitalism, child labour, human trafficking, systemic racism, ISIS, The Xinjiang re-education camps, conflict in the Middle-East, treatment and displacement of indigenous persons, COVID19, etc. and mosquitos. Can you CMV?",hyyysc,"""It's OK to have bad thoughts, you may have them because they were learnt from a parent or teacher, from a traumatic experience, or even from a film, YOU ARE NOT YOUR THOUGHTS. You are a series of decisions and actions you make every day.""

I found this bit a little odd. You talk about intrusive thoughts, thoughts based on traumatic memories and thoughts connected to paraphilias (which are all very specific thoughts produced by mental health issues and distorted thinking), and then you jump to this, which seems to be a universal conclusion that applies to everyone, including those with no mental health problems. The thing is, I don't think you can use a very specific type of thought to excuse and justify all negative/horrible thoughts anyone anywhere may have. Our thoughts (and now I'm not talking about thoughts that appear due to mental health issues) *are* a reflection of who we are. They don't just appear out of thin air. You say that it is our decisions and actions that show who we are, but those decisions and actions rest on thoughts we had before doing them, right? If what we do is who we are, then the thoughts that motivated us to do that would also have to stem from who we are.",fzg36ky,3.1666666666666665
Tesla is an overhyped stock and the stock price should not be this high.,"Tesla has literally a higher market value than every single car company in the world. The stock price should 100% not be this high and should be much lower, as it hasn't even sold that many electric cars yet. Elon Musk talks more big things than he actually does and Tesla is overhyped. Tesla is probably not going anywhere for many more years and it is very weird that Elon Musk temporarily had a higher net worth than Jeff Bezos, who runs arguably one of the largest companies in the world that everyone buys from and is a huge business, in contrast with Tesla where people simply overhype what Tesla is going to do in the future.",kvukdo,"&gt;as it hasn't even sold that many electric cars yet.

How many cars they have sold is irrelevant.  Stock price is tied to how much people want your stock, not your product. While yes having a product lots of people have will help, it's not a requirement.

Knowing that it depends on how many people want the stock rather than how many people have the product, why should it be lower of lots of people want it and will pay that?",gj0johk,3.4

I wish restaurants in the U.S. had the option to not have a waiter and allow self-service.,"I hate the tipping culture in the USA where an additional 15-30% is gently forced onto the end of your meal so that restaurants can underpay their employees. I think that being a waitstaff is one of the easiest remedial jobs and paying slightly above minimum wage would be enticing enough to combat the shorter shift hours.

I would gladly go pick up my own food, get my own drinks, and clean up my own table at the end of service to save 20% on a $100 bill and I know many people would do the same. If I need recommendations on food, I can just ask anyone that works there, just as you would do at a non sit-down restaurant. Worst of all is when you go to a buffet and do all the work yourself but they have someone there doing the *bare minimum* humanly possible just so they can guilt you into a few bucks.

People might then suggest that I order take-out to avoid tipping, but eating food out of plastic containers that don't do a particularly great job at preserving the texture/temperature of foods after a long car ride home is not exactly a great experience.

If I have an exceptional meal, I would much rather tip the people directly responsible for preparing the food as that is the main reason to go out to eat. (to order things you can't easily or don't care to make at home.)

edit: **I don't think I made it very clear. I'm not asking to go to Morton's steakhouse and expect to have the option to seat myself and pick up the food from the kitchen. Certain restaurants need waiters and that is very clear. I'm just proposing a more fast-casual option where you order in the lobby and food is delivered to your table. You then are responsible for seating yourself, getting silverware and then there are bussboys that cleanup (no tipping.)**

**Also I'm proposing eliminating waiters from restaurants like Buffets and providing more natural waitstaff options for restaurants that are laid out in a counter-serve fashion but force waitstaff onto you (i.e. lots of chinese/vietnamese restaurants.) Some of you may think that Buffets do not have waiters, but they do. Not only do they exist but they are extra try-hard by doing everything in their power to make you think their work is worthy of your 20%.**",ehy2z4,"Actually, what you're describing is quite common where I live and I think it's awesome. It tends to be pretty popular around college campuses, since students can't really afford to eat out consistently at traditional restaurants.

You get something in between a restaurant and fast food, where food is prepared and left on the counter, you grab it yourself and you bus your own table. It's not perfect, but it seems to work quite well. To give you a few common examples: chipotle, or sushi boat restaurants both don't really have wait staff.",fcnuldx,3.4
Corporate tax rates should be higher than the highest individual income tax rate,"I'm no economist or accountant so set me straight

First off, I will not argue for any specific tax rate for corporations or individuals.  I do realize the corporate tax rates that are too high could drive companies to move their headquarters to countries with more favorable rates.  That is a separate issue and its solution is well above my pay grade.

Higher corporate taxes will not result in corporations paying much more money in taxes. Unlike individuals, corporations are taxed on profits, not revenue.  To avoid paying more in taxes, they just have to spend more money.  This can be investments in facilities, equipment, services, employees, dividends, etc.  All of this is good. The more money that changes hands the better off the economy is.  And at the end of every chain of businesses buying things from each other are individuals who are making more money because of it. Now they pay more taxes to actually fund the government and have more disposable income to keep the ball rolling.

TL:DR, individuals pay taxes on income whether they save it or spend it. Corporations only pay taxes on money they save.  Corporations should be discouraged from saving money to keep it moving.",o6o0ki,"There should be NO income tax.

The Beef Ban is a bad decision made by India,"My family and I are Hindu-Indians. We eat beef and every kind of meat. None of us are vegetarian. But that is besides the point.

About a few weeks ago, I saw on the Indian News Channel that India is issuing a Beef Ban in India. (Beef consumption was already prohibited in a few cities) The only reason I heard of was because ""Cow"" is the animal of the Hindu culture.

The reasons that India claimed why the ban should be issued doesn't make sense.

This ban could be supported by a minority, not a majority. And for the minority that does not want to eat beef in India doesn't have too. There are literally other meats that could be eaten. There is no reason to take away someone's right in eating beef, just because it is from a spirit animal that died. 

Forbidding people from consuming beef is simply TOO FAR. I saw a video 6 years back of a man who got arrested from eating a beef burger. That's right. EATING A BURGER. Did it harm anyone? No. Did it make that man feel bad? No. Simply poor justice from a police system and government.

People who don't want to eat beef and want the consumption of beef banned are obviously sensitive. The cow already died. We cannot revive it magically to make your problems with making a spirit animal live go away. 

Beef is also healthy.  Beef has an abundance of nutrients like B-vitamins, zinc, iron and protein and comes in such a delicious package with relatively few calories. Among the many delicious benefits you get from enjoying lean beef, one of the most remarkable is its role in supporting health.  Sure other meats are healthy also but beef is also healthy.

That is my view on a law that is happening in a country my family and I are from. We live in America so this law doesn't affect us but still decided to present my view on this.",o4lc9n,"Completely agree beef should not be banned.

Expected Family Contribution is BS. I’m 31 and I live with my wife. My parents shouldn’t be expected to contribute to my education at my age.,"CMV: (United States) Expected Family Contribution is BS. I’m 31, an adult, and I live with my wife. Why should my parents chip in?

As the title says, EFC is ridiculous and I don’t understand why the federal government (US) decides that this is what they expect my family to contribute. It says they should be giving me $7k towards my college. I love my parents and they’ve definitely contributed that much to get me here but they don’t help me with college. I’m not sure about other families but I’m 31 and I have to use loans to pay for my college.

This is probably a minor gripe because the loan covers most of my tuition but I just wonder if I’d be more eligible for grants if that number wasn’t there. How do they even calculate that?

Anyway, I’m probably venting more than asking but I am curious about other viewpoints on this. I can see how this would be good for evaluating if the government should help someone with rich parents but couldn’t they tone down the expectations when a child reaches a certain age or can prove that they live completely on their own. 

Does anyone above 30 here get help from their parents for college? Does anyone work in the fields related to this topic here? Can they help me understand why this matters at my age? I suppose they aren’t supposed to know my age but maybe I can elect to provide proof or something to be opted out?

Defunding the police does not solve the primary issue around racism (i.e. systemic racism in police dept),"Assuming that the main issue around the Floyd incident is around systemic racism then I believe the problem lies in the subconscious behavior of the police force itself. Now I think, within the context of the police dept, this issue can be dealt with either creating a policy to address the subconscious bias or a third party that makes the police dept accountable for their actions or both. 

However, defunding the police would only allocate certain services from the police to other social service which would reduce the likelihood of police violence since interactions with the police and marginalized communities should decrease. In an alternate universe if this policy had been implemented before Floyd's death then he would not be using a counterfeit bill in the first place. 

Therefore, it seems like this policy would improve the marginalized communities but does not directly address the main issue which is systemic racism within the police dept.",hbisw1,"It's not meant to.

Religions shouldn’t get tax exemptions or other governmental benefits unless they are at least 300 years old,"I mean most actual religions are really old. Even younger religions like Sikhism is around 500 years old. Making a limit on how old a religion needs to be to get benefits from the government would, in my opinion greatly reduce cults or at least discourage them. 

The way governments could track this is by religions having to show old artifacts or historical importance that predates the limit the government sets. Most major religions would have more than enough evidence to prove they are a religion then. 

The only major issues I see with this argument religions that were stifled leading to lack of artifacts or history and sub-types of religions possibly having difficulties. Both of these issues could still be resolved though, it would just be harder for them than it is for most major religions. 

This argument is just for what should get government benefits like tax breaks and such, not for stopping younger religions. Over time a younger religion could turn into a religion that can get these benefits, this would be like social Darwinism for religions the ones with clear thinking last whereas the ones that are cults die out.",levcm6,How about we don’t give tax exemptions to institutions that promote crazy lies?,gmjnj6f,1.8
South African Politics are taking the BLM movement out of context.,"For context I am a 19 year old white male born in post-Apartheid South Africa. I DO NOT CONDONE VIOLENCE AGAINST INDIVIDUALS BASED ON ANY DIFFERENCES INCLUDING RACE/ GENDER/ RELIGION/ SKIN COLOUR NOR DO I SUPPORT IT.

&amp;#x200B;

As you might know South Africa has had a history of racial discrimination against non-whites, the discrimination was mostly targeted at the people from the Tribes of the Northern part of South Africa/ Southern Africa, the people of these various tribes had a darker skin tone than the tribes(Khoisan) at the Southern Cost. Early conflicts between the Northern tribes and the white colonialists has caused bad blood between the two groups from early on eg. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle\_of\_Blood\_River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Blood_River). This is one of the factors that I personally think led to the Apartheid system(which I don't support).

&amp;#x200B;

The African National Congress(ANC), founded in 1912 with the goal to unite the African People of South Africa and protect their freedoms and rights. They became more popular in the 1950's and 1960's when the ANC was banned and many of the high ranking members including Nelson Mandela were imprisoned for conspiring to overthrow the state following the Rivonia Trial. The ANC started their military wing uMkhonto weSizwe(MK) during this time after no avail with peaceful demonstrations. The MK were trained in camps outside of South Africa, these camps were controlled by the USSR with camps in Africa, Vietnam and the Soviet Union. The new ANC strategy was to make the townships ungovernable and create chaos in black communities. Burning down houses and necklacing was used by the ANC to punish black individuals who were perceived as collaborators with the Apartheid government or other opposing black parties/organizations(IFP, BCM), their are 672 confirmed cases of people being burned alive by necklacing during this time period, bombings in public spaces were also a common occurence. This tactic ultimately succeeded after the International Trade bans and outcry in the International community, the ANC won the majority vote in 1994 and Nelson Mandela became the first black president of South Africa, creating the term, The Rainbow Nation. Atrocities were commited to end atrocities, debatably it is understandable that these atrocities had to have been commited to end years of oppresion.

&amp;#x200B;

SAYING THE CURRENT STATE OF SOUTH AFRICA IS APPALLING IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT:

1.The Cape Coloured People, previously slaves from the South East Asia mixed with the Khoisan, has been abandoned by the ANC Government and are living in Gang ridden warzones where children are taken in by these gangs and tasked to kill members of opposing gangs.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsFE\_jXPzNE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsFE_jXPzNE)

&amp;#x200B;

2.The ANC Government has had an history with Coruption and low political transparency, the previous president Jacob Zuma, previously a MK member during the Apartheid struggle has been responsible for Billions of Dollars in damages, buying himself a 20 million Dollar house with taxpayer money and smuggling goods out of South Africa. Millions are spent on Government projects that exceeds the estimated costs by a large margin.

&amp;#x200B;

3.The ANC threatens to take away white owned land without compensation by changing constitutional laws on private property rights. I do believe we have to have reparations for previously owned land that has been stolen. The farming of a abundance South African land is only possible with Western farming technology that hadn't yet been discovered by the indigenous people at the time South Africa had been colonized. The ANC is not calling for only the land but also the farming infrastructure that had been built on that land WITHOUT compensation to the owners. The ANC has spent Billions on the previous Willing seller, willing buyer land reform strategy and has failed, the land they had bought had been redistributed to inexperienced and uneducated farmers weakening one of the driving forces of the South African economy. Expropriation has happened in Zimbabwe where people starved to death.

&amp;#x200B;

4.The Poverty rate in South Africa is about 50%, millions of people are living in appalling conditions with a massive wealth dispersity. White individuals are still far better of on average compared to other races in South Africa. I think this is both due to aftermath of Apartheid but also to blame on the ANC that has after 26 years in a democracy failed to uplift the impoverished people of this country. The ANC blames white individuals for their failure in uplifting these people. Somehow the ANC government still wins with majority vote...

&amp;#x200B;

More extremist parties representing black individuals have started growing in recent years after people have realized the ANC can't uplift them. Examples of these are the Black First Land First(BLF) party with a focus on taking white owned land and the Economic Freedom Fighters(EFF), a Marxist party looking to uplift black individuals by means of Socialism. These parties are racist themselves, claiming white people are at fault and sometimes even stating white people should be killed. Even the previous ANC president Jacob Zuma has sung a song saying  ""Kill the Boer"" that can be easily interpreted as kill the white man.
